 I saw myself in the mirror and I was just wasn't proud
You been ignoring the open window that come around
I mean lets say we begin
And beings lazy a sin
You rather Greg crazy with friends
And then you staging your end
And with all the time lost you degrading your pen
And know you living check to check gotta save for the rent noome to blame but yourself
Coulda have the fame and your wealth
But niggas rather spend it all on chains and a belt
I mean I never understand but each is it own
I'm reminded of my faults when I'm deep in the zone
And you always gotta peep who you keep in your home
It ain't no fool in metwice no repeating my wrongs
Cause I learn learn allll from my mistakes
I drive to get it I get in in different kinda ways
We come from crooked fathers
Ancestors Brooklyn Dodgers
Generated to gangsters, ballers, and crooks and mobsters
My generations be Christians They tell em look for Harvard
So I run the game for saint but Reggie bush the starter
I'm bout to wild today and cheer like its 2008
Back when my president is black was something proud to say (harder emotion)cause haven't seen change and Uzi drive a green range
And life is draining everybody's hope it's such a mean game
It'll slapped me in the face I got a taste just as teenage
I think about my past I chose my path i go complete rage
Cause I feel just like a author
Got a story to tell
Where you choose two paths either glory or hell
I mean we all got a road to follow
Perform shows apollo
And just blow colossal
Believe me nigga I know
Some listening thinking damn
This far fetched
But I'll be shooting for moon, and hit the stars next

But all we could do is ride
All we do is ride
We got to cause when down to your fucking last who can stop you
Cause nigga nigga I know how to get it

Rhyming just for the sake of rhyming
Making deals with Bills sI gotta face the timing
But I'm ill with skills a nigga patient minded
The beat killed and drilled a I gotta faced violence
It's flu season these niggas hating for 2 reason
Other rappers is salty a nigga too seasoned
Other averages and faulty
Im a just a cool deacon
Im too great great- with a new tape
Like dude wait
Im like buggy im hopping to never lose faith
And mike bibby a the mind I gotta shoot straight
And most likely supreme leader of new age
Niggas shooting machines heaters and tools blaze
The game full of the feinss divas and blue haze
Nigga listen to music like this dudes great
A small mixture of d darkly quite and Lupe
A tall nigga it's all scripted what you say
He clearly all I been killing the classics
Making the Good music and appealing to masses
Man they feeling this bastard/ the realest of rappers
Surrounded by the goats never chilling with average

I remember days when I didn't have the worries
I remember days me and Parris had em nervous
I remember days when we kill it purpose
And now they gonna pay me service
It's worth

And I remember days when we was choppin at the function
I remember days when we didn't have nothin
All them late night on the grind count for somethin
So fuck all the stupid assumption



I see through all moves like John wall and Brad beal
I'm mad real
Lets get it popping like Advil
But when you see your people dying it's a sad feel
Enjoy life you never know when your last meal
It's so trife and crazy just how a blast kill
So please the judging me of my past still
Cause soon all a nigga rocking is pastel
The best coming from DMV since fat trel
Niggas quiting and snitching they grow a rats tail
Like dude broke how the hell you make a fast bail
Putting out garbage albums for a fast sell
Don't needs that- the games faded like cheap tats
I preach facts
I piss music and bleed rap
So fuck no I don't need negative feed back
Cause honestly I been dope




 [verse 1]
I knew that life has its wonder i merely have to explore
You ever give you someone your all and they still asking for more
You ever witness all your dreams fucking crash through the door
You ever have a open mind about until it blast through the floor
But but I won't give my up hope
The shit all that I got
Respect to ones who would love whether I'm balling or not
Cause when you fall from the tops- dog it's a hella of a crash ignore the haters and doubters with they irreverent ass
Man I just wanna make music
Like fuck the cheddar and cash
Cause it won't bring me to piece
And money never would last
I mean I'm better than that
I mean it shouldn't have changed
And I can't wait to break out and put my foot in the game
And tell them all about the song and won't mention your name


[verse 2]
I heard the cage bird sing and it's a beautiful sound
But it so be much damn better girl if you was around
And I see you still got a man
But damn dude is clown
I'm sorry that I had to look, I heard you flew through the town
Bet shit I settle for less
Damn I'm never the best
Cause the only thing that really last forever is death
Go and shoot  a couple videos wear sweaters and vest
Just to show them that I'm different and I'm clever as chest
But honestly I'm the greatest and I'll dare to admit it
But others disagree  if talent don't compare with the the digits but money don't mean shit if you can't share with your niggas we all eat if I eat that's something rare with these niggas
I mean why squeeze on the paper you can't take it with you
And buying shit a stress relive and I'm facing issues-  you know doing right something when the hate official
But please baby pay attention cause I cause pray they miss you


[verse 3]
It's always sunshine after the rain
And it's a some crying laughter and pain
And I don't know how to prepare for the disaster and fame
Who I go to for guidance cause the pastor the same
I hate the struggle and mostly just how shitty it feels
And momma Car got stolen twice got round hickory hills we was catching the bus, but never a missing a meal
But I appreciate the time it made a nigga for real
Moved to the burbs necessary bettered the living
It was a wonderful choice
And I don't regret the decision
Plus I made some great friends that I'm never forgetting
I got a love for the music but the pleasure is missing
Don't appreciate art they never treasure the vision
But i still beat the odds
I'm not dead or in prison
So I'm grateful for the days and I'm not in debt to the system play the song and just pledge to the rhythm
Cause baby we going far




 [Intro]
Maddox on the beat
MWA Music
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position

[Verse 1]
The game is over, my pain is over
You a lame, a joker
You can't catch me plus my flow is nasty
And my name is vulgar
YBN, go and try again, we be the flyest friends
I do my thing
Plus I pull some strings just like a violin
Let me tell you 'bout my life and my troubled past
Momma's car got stolen, took the shuttle pass
Re-up from three bucks copped the duffle bag
Please bruh, off these nuts, go and rush some cash
And now we winning again
My brothers spending a band
My niggas posted on the block, damn I be sinning with friends
I'm chasing twenties, Benjamins, and breaking barriers too
My family rich for generations, I might marry a Jew
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position, uh

[Verse 2]
My lifestyle too wild, I know
Everything change with a new high low
Fifty bands, what I cashed in, my show
I got that gas, this that hydro
I'm too great, I don't have rivals
Niggas be telling speed dial 5-0
Cause these niggas be fake
I'm a winner these days
Motherfuckers be sweet, with a hint of cheesecake
Syrup spilling, coughin' penicillin
Heads turning walking in the building
Ledge burnin' often I'm a villain
Was deserted, brought up by some real ones
Had to catch it reckless, was a daily
Momma calling checking on her baby
Took a trip to Texas going crazy
Eating beats for breakfast, I'm elated
I was stressing, blessings on the way
Dropped out, no testing me today
Murder tracks, I bet I beat the case
Redbone, she built like LisaRaye
Stack my chips I bought my Frito Lay
I don't listen what these people say
Fuck a Honda, niggas need a Wraith
Damn the whole team eating great

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster, ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position (ah)




 [Intro]
We are anonymous
Yeah
Some- this...
This is one of them joints, man
Uh

[Verse 1]
You ever have a bad dream?
Wake up and it's a sad thing
Paint a picture vivid, no flat screen
Gotta get the cash, C.R.E.A.M
Bright lights, see the flash beams
Life's a movie, better know that scene (haha)
Because I'm the leading actor of these fetus rappers
They all my sons, I gotta breed them faster
I'm undefeated for several reasons, I bring disaster
We need to see the pastor
With decency and laughter
They doubt I beat the chatter
But one day I'm gon' find myself
And I'mma do this shit by myself
But we gon' be straight, give me three days
I'll make a rhyme for pete's sake
Eat lobster and cheesecake
With vodka and cheap Bape
But we gon' get it, and get it again
Different Benz, same friends
I'm committed to win
It's no more lame trends
We is finished with them
And all the hater get a kick in the shin
But we don't fuck with that
Remember time was simple in tenth grade with bucket hats?
Pride gun, I tuck it back
Life crazy, my luck gets bad
Well I'mma say to you
We gon' make it through
And 'til the rain go away, I'm gon' play it cool

[Hook]
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

[Verse 2]
The hex or a spell around it
I'm humble, they tell I'm grounded
They shoot and there's shells around it
Trump and them bell has sounded
The end in times, will we burn for sins and crimes?
Spared for giving spares and shared beginning rhymes
But this is nowhere near the end, though
Miss Dave on the back porch smoking indo
Playing that Nintendo
Chilling with the kin folk
Everything A-OK like tenth floor
But times done got harder
And we done got tougher
I didn't anticipate it
But shit's a lot rougher
But how can you thrive and succeed but not suffer?
The struggle make you real and the nigga got gutter
But soon straight steaks on my plate, hot butter
And everything gonna open up, stop clutter
So I'mma tell you, "Slow your roll, stand tall, don't fold
And everything that glitters ain't gold"
But you should

[Hook]
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

[Outro]
I mean...
You just gotta bounce back from all your L's and come ten time harder. You can't do all the shit you can't change, right?

 [Soon]




 I swear hate you but I love you the same
You help ease my troubles help me go through the pain
And if it were not for you I'd be goin insane
But for real you need to stay in your lane
I mean I love so much I be eyeing you out
And when my lips touch yours I fly high in the clouds
And you always wake the neighbors baby you just to loud
But you always calm me down that's why I keep around
But it's time for change where our paths will criss cross
You made me fail that drug test baby I'm pissed off conservative big boss
You know my persona
Why you always on my sack girl that is a honor
I mean I'm gon off the ganja
Girl you powers are magical
And the statement that I'm leavin you is honestly laughable they different view you show you me of the world is impractical
Cause honestly exposure is a trait I'm attracted to
But a change is needed and you know it's truth
But becausethat's the one thing that's more potent than you
Member when we was alone
And I would flow in the booth
The inspiration you gave it made show and improve
And for that I'm so thankful, and you know that grateful
And if everyone tried the world wouldn't be hateful
But you got your own faults it ain't no lying at sin
You fuckin up my community kids try you at 10
Now let's try this again 2nd time we round the troops
Your impact is amazing ppl die for a ounce of you
You even make em try a hash tag but I'm pounding you
But damn the way you the make us go crazy astounding boo but you always got benefits
You making my niggas rich
And quite a few go to jail for you so you split in it
Member days we'd be getting kicking it
We'd be watching the stars line
You even let start to sell you out through the hard times
Never let me go broke
I kept bread in my pocket
So i stop the using you and I used you profit
And for that I'm so sorry was no reason for shopping you
I kept believe I pimped my main girl to a prostitute
But you make niggas rob and shoot
And you ended a block or 2
And you limit potential you make me wonder what I could do you make some grow addicted so it ain't nomo stopping through
Cause me in blowing in this rap shit is not optional
So girl we threw
Sorry I got to do this
And if I choose it you know my choice is the music
So I'm saying goodbye you just apart of my old life
I knew for a cpl years knew rap for my whole life




 Yo this shit is real
I'm worried bout rapping tryna get a deal
But niggas getting killed and shot a lot of emits teal
Sad thing only 15 but shit he missing meals
Had to watch his mama tune up get a bigger thrill
So mad all anger just building inside
Temptation killing his pride
As adrenaline hides
Loses breath his people getting drilled in his eyes
He don't know what else to do stands still and he cries
Say black lives matters
Dead body's lies after
Government hides laughter
They dont give a fuck
We down welfare cheating
Plus chicken grease eating
Lazy ass niggas always tryna get a buck
And I know that's what they thinking whether like it or not protesting in the streets niggas fighting the cops
Man I'm preaching to my brethren and enlighten the block
I just another nigga wasting the violence to stop
I can't breathe


Can't breathe we dead already- before we live we getting shot in head already I can't breathe

I mean it's sad shit
It's black kids that's getting blasted
By law enforcement that's acting
Commit harassment
How the hell we pay attention sit in classes
All my people shot damn  this shots distracting
My niggas get so abused- apology overdue
And please expose the truth
To the world with a global view
No reverend
We can do is just protested it
Waiting outside and niggas is so restless
Gotta face the danger
Getting shot a racist strangers
Take the anger
From angry impatient ranger
God damn they wanna kill us
We just dumb gorilla
Assume we got guns and drill is
It's not fun for niggas
I mean we gotta change something
Damn these lames frontin
Imagine they your main cousin
Was the frame public
See what the next option
But Feds watching
Cause we got way to much fucking bloodshed dropping

 [Intro]
I don't think they ready for this one
I come from the gutter
It's that country shit man

[Verse 1]
I came from the gutter, the bottom
The fuck is the problem? It's always trouble in Gotham
If he stutter, they robbin', we catch the shuttle to Harlem
Makin' plays like huddles, it's no rebuttals, they solid
The code from the OGs, the Jordan, the Kobes
I be studying game, get the score from the nosebleeds
When you tourin', exploding, its more important than voting
Little niggas getting killed and now we forced to be toting
Cuz I done lost some lil' homies, couple cousins, it's crazy
A lil' brother straight bustin', now he stuck with a baby
And he like fuck it it's gravy, it's just another occasion
Was some luck that gone save him, but shit he stuck on probation

[Chorus]
And it's just another day in the life
When you raised in the trife
Now I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions
Lay awake in the night
Gotta pray to get right
In the shade gettin' high like I had to get it

[Verse 2]
Made a couple transactions, felt fantastic
That retail therapy is just a scam tactic
A new wave of new slaves to the brand package
Boy my gas be supreme, not a damn jacket
I ran rapid, sheep niggas with lamb habits
College kids doin' xans, acid, and cram classes
Procrastinate on exam passes and slam asses
Fast forward, my fans massive, my plans mastered
Speakin' from experience, I seen from these lames
Your potential isn't tapped, where will it even begin
My whole team gon' be eatin', don't mind feedin' my friends
Cuz dog, I'd rather be in meetings, fuck tweetin' a trend
On the outside strong but I'm bleedin' within
I know you tired of all the cryin' and the grievin' the sin
God gave LeBron height and blessed me with a pen
A real nigga but most of all, a leader of men

[Chorus]
And it's just another day in the life
When you raised in the trife
Now I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions
Lay awake in the night
Gotta pray to get right
In the shade gettin' high like I had to get it




 [verse 1]
Need this song to blow up and get plays fast
Just looking where My grandmama stay at
Graduating school see the debt I gotta pay backing
My money looking rocky I need some more of it ASAP
So Here's the tape all a nigga fucking working on
That's all my verses long
Cause the hurt is strong
I told I was the greatest and not word was wrong
I'm was searching For my purpose
And I murders songs
What's the verdict
Minds lurking that's the herb I'm on
Everybody call my line with alerted tones
Rappers don't want beef eat a ceralion
What's at steak (stake) is my fate
And my verbal thrown
No pun intended
A nigga I was born a run this business
Account balance is always sayin my funds suspended
I'm Tryna buy a beach invited tons of women
Dive in the water slidr ain't no fun in swimming
You should know they from exotic places
Black and white girls man I'm not a racist
Future house so big couldn't find the basement
All Tryna move up but we climb adjacent
Presently these goals is just manifested
Cause rn pockets is anerexic
People hating on the grind and I can't respect it
Gotta vision for the future damn my plans is hectic

[verse 2]
I bring heat to winter
Roll my sleeve when I enter
Blow trees eat dinner
Beg plead to a winner
Not needing a damn thang
Y'all popping champagne
I start a campaign
Can't stop a rampage
Man I go off
Fa sho boss
Y'all so soft
And I underrated and undefeated got no loss
Im colder than February and snow with 11 flurries but my life's in a golden state like I'm Stephen curry
I told momma I'm blowing up so she never worry
And to the haters that's plotting on me be dead and buried
My second tape
I elevate
See better days
Forever paid
I'm here now y'all never stay
A real nigga
No hillfiger my bills bigger
The same people that chill witcha
Will kill quicker
I seen it happen
Hurricanes and fema laughing
A leader passing
Say nothing a just feed the madness
The a bleeding passion metaphors for me with rapping
Hip hop is so dead just clean the ashes
The sweetest fashion
Man I'm flyer than 3 Aladins
On the carpet with a jasmine she the baddest




 [verse 1]
I come from a different breed got a different approach
Cause what's life without grind and you living for hope
But man these be like 9 and they hitting the dope
So we fall in da plan they consider us jokes
These all true facts but you knew dat
I mean I flew back
To city to drop a new track
I'm so anxious
But the listeners they be so brainless
So keep your stupid ass opinion up yo anus
You get the method
They catching bullets like interceptions
RIP KING STEELO man this shit a lesson
Cause kids don't play tag they got a smith an western
They quick to shoot your ass up if you disrespecting
Crips, bloods, and pyru's
Pull up with 5 dudes
Come snatch your fly shoes
Reminisce high school
I've never been to one to hideaway confrontation
Especially from these bum rappers who not as patient
Amazing that they blow up my time a come soon
We different like ying yang or the Sun moon
Bragging bought your cheap chains like you dumb coon
White folks mad see our posters on his son room
And we got them so scared
We compelling the youth
They attracted to my music cause I'm telling the truth
Roomate saying nigga nobody better than you
I swear he never lied cause we move like a veteran move and


[verse 2]
I never hideaway from pressure I'm never afraid
I can't wait for the years where I'm better than Jay
And I'm talking bout accounts I'll have cheddar for days
Flippin stocks show them niggas I'm clever with ways
Will flip a beat
Till its misery
This shit is history
That's word to legend Tye Tribett I got the victory
Your shit is weak
That's a known fact no mystery
I blow up and shonuff it's meant to be
Visions of future
I'm timid with Luther
Nailing notes to my wall
Fuck we posing and ball
All this explosion I caused
How Cause the emotion raw
Feds is imposing the law
Killing us choking us all
Now they unloading the dogs
Tempers is rising
Oh you dun started soothing
You know niggas be violent
You done gave us reason
Now we major we bleeding
On the crip of the evening
Come equipped with a deacon
Because prayer is needed
They got a layer defeated
But we just busting through
Nigga that's up to you
I learn knowledge through experience we say fuck the schools
I pop a pill like I'm bill but I'm no Huxtable but I'll never run away nigga

 [verse 1]
I'm feeling good today
Top down roof missing in hood today
To the party ain't no way that I wouldn't stay
So happy fuck niggas just couldn't hate
Damn how the fuck I'm so full of joy- got problems most people hope would avoid
But I'm chilling real hard at ocean views
Even though a most a nigga bills overdue
Don't give a fuck dawg I cop more clothes and shoes
Wearing fly shit that most bad hoes would choose
Took his girl now this nigga bouta blow a fuse
I out even take it serious I'm so amused
Why stress over life it's a beautiful day
Not to mention God blessed with my musical ways
Always have  good energy the Buddha would say
Cause most problems escalade uprooted from hate


[Chorus]
Problems solved I feel today
No stress no strain I cuz feel good today
It ain't no way I should good today
But I feel so good today




 [Intro]
Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell Momma imma quit but I love cash

[Verse 1]
I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends (ayy)
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin jugs
Used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, Your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened
Got a new bitch from China, she wearing designer
I'm lacing her in the new fashion (ayy)

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep a Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Told Momma imma quit but I love cash

[Verse 2]
I've been all around the fucking globe
Baby what ya know
Motherfucker better tuck and roll
Got places to go
And niggas missed the last flight
Livin' in the fast life
Momma said you never act right (goddamn)
Guess I'm a bad guy
But I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, and my benjiz blue
Shit is fucked up when they envy you
'Member niggas got killed over Penny shoes
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty of you
It was all a dream, reminiscing of a smaller thing
Grandma cooking like Paula Deen
It ain't all it seems, grew up with the starving teens
And growing plants, still watering

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash, hit the route fast
I'ma get that lil nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep a Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Told Momma imma quit but I love cash

 All I ever wanted
(x12)


This for the ones never heard of me
I kill a track and I murder beats
Gotta fix up the game that's the surgery
On the pac I be geeking like Urkle be
Got that gas boy I'm smoking on purple tree
Nigga I spit that fire to 3rd to degree
All these rapper be liars they purpin b
I stay humble and kill it that's word to Reek
I spit that raw shit
You should be causious
Flow is sick leave it you nautious
I do this often
You niggas soften
Lyrics puttem in coffin
Hit them like I'm Kenny lifton
Run the game niggas crawling
My bank be calling me artist
Cause all I'm doing is withdrawing
Hit the plug lemme hold a pound
He just front me cause he know the sound
My brovas good no one broke around
A nigga crazy then it's going down
Fuck the violence this the last time
I don't fuck black on black crime
I be feeling bad bros blast nines
So my karma coming this a bad sign

I switch the style and I make it easy
I change my friends because they was greedy
(x2)

All I wanted
(x6)

Codeine crazy got me lazy
Bitches that wouldn't fade me
Want my baby
Couple years I be pushin that Mercedes
Free lil bro used fuck with em daily
Now I be blowing dope in the club
I used shovel snow for the dub
Y'all still go to hoes for a hug
I just notice bros showing love

And that's




 [Intro]
Wooh!
Alright, alright
Now listen, listen loud and clear, you dig?
This is uh, this is history
For real nigga
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Now check me out, listen

[Verse 1]
Why everybody change on me?
While I remain the same, that's why I'm bringing Major Payne
Like mothafuckin' Damon Wayans
And now you chickens is toast, this ain't Raising Cane's
It's clear we wasn't raised the same, rappers lame with fame
I'm known to kill a wack rapper like a bad hobby
I smash hotties and stash bodies, then cop lil' boats
Like that's Yachty, and that's probably
Why I'm so fly that I crash lobbies and after it slap thotties
I'm a rap fanatic who rap fantastic without the platinum status
Why I'm blastin' the maddest 'cause most of these cats is average (uh)
I swear to God that I never lie to avoid a fact
A terrible hair stylist, I'm destroying tracks
I don’t bust guns but my niggas deploy the strap
Then bring out a fucking .45 like Michael Jordan's back
I wanna give these niggas hell if heaven was grant
The best thing from PG since Kevin Durant

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is, yeah
Oh yeah, YBN shit
Don't doubt my name, I said, I tell 'em what my name
Nigga better know the name, yeah, YBN shit
Better know, my name is (yuh)

[Verse 2]
See, a nigga was skippin' class, damn I rather attempt the raps
Said fuck it I'm missing that, when I blow go tick for tack
I'm a boss on my Diddy shit, my flow is too hideous
Dropped out of school, senior year, a true idiot
You see, I wear designer bags, I don't carry minor cash
I'm trying to find the stack, big as Blac Chyna's ass
Oh you wack rhymers, trash climbers, that's kinda sad
In the pathfinder, but my path couldn't find my dad
Now my soul dented, pulled up in a Ghost tinted
In a drive-by, where niggas shooting shit like Cole Bennett
You ho's finished, in this rap shit a cold menace
But I'm flowin' gold liquid, damn I'm so vicious
Uh, my name is Cordae, but don't forget the YBN
I used to get high with friends off grandmama's vicodins
And mix it with a percocet, damn that really worked a sweat
My verse is just perfect, yeah, fuck it go and search the net

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is
Nigga's be the lamest, YBN shit
My name, you nigga's know his name
The nigga's flow is lame, nigga, hah

[Outro]
Man, these niggas whack as fuck in this music shit, bro, like what the fuck
You niggas suck like shit bro, like damn you niggas fucking suck
Man

 I got them hits like I'm Derek Jeter
Only smoking in the rarest reefer
Got a girl man I dare to meet her
Producers hat  me always I tear they beat up-member days never rock designer
Now a nigga only shop for finer
Catch me eating at hottest diners
Man that boy entendre is finest rhymer
I'm going back to my old Ways
Don't fuck with haters cause they so fake
My girl tripping I go OJ
Squad pimpin we the Coldplay
We all home ain't no free squad
Catch us riding in a speed car
Lil dev popped 3 bars- and you know we all laced in G Star
Soon gang be Giuseppe stepping
So I never do the heavy stressing
I swear  my mind is a deadly weapon
And Use it just about it every lesson
Im on the grind and I'm getting bigger
Why they watching damn these niggas bitter
I hit the stu and you hit the Twitter
Do something that'll get you richer
Never been a hater
I'm a innovator
Girl I'll penetrative ya in a minute
Moving weight that's the fitness
Nigga hate on some bitch shit




 [Pre Chorus:]
Not stepping out
Walk walk ohhh
Walk walk walk
Walk walk walk

[Chorus:]
Not going out tonight I'm never leaving my room
I don't be hitting the clubs it only lead to my doom
Not feeling the outside I'd rather stay to myself
I don't need nobody help this shit not good for my health
But when I'm all alone I just be thinking so clear
Can't fathom nobody here don't wanna show all my tears
Cuz I'm down down down I'm tired of going down down down

[Verse 1: Cordae]
Hold on ay when I hop up outta my sleep
I just be feeling so weak
Stress coming from my head to my feet
Everyday I'm moody thats how i be
But thats mood swings onto some new things
Cute face and dem blue jeans
She left I ain't trippin no shoe strings
Everyday we all lose dreams
But you gotta catch it everyday life living reckless
Eating disaster for breakfast
Bad decisions damn that shit is my preference
Turn a bag now a nigga been stressin
But its all self inflicted mad cuz I failed to listen
20/20 bro the vision with bail decisions
Never jail or prison
Thank god I'm compelled with wisdom
Cuz when that peer pressure hit ya I'm a miraculous nigga
I'd rather rap to get richer
I thank my pastor for scriptures
They photosnappin with pictures
Mixed with the pack and the liquor
Then the disaster is quicker
And they blasting with triggers

[Chorus:]
Not going out tonight I'm never leaving my room
I don't be hitting the clubs it only lead to my doom
Not feeling the outside I'd rather stay to myself
I don't need nobody help this shit not good for my health
But when I'm all alone I just be thinking so clear
Can't fathom nobody here don't wanna show all my tears
Cuz I'm down down down I'm tired of going down down down

[Verse 2: Adrian Stresow]
Yeah Yeah
I've been trynna get my paper up
And get famous enough that I don't have to pay for stuff
I've been so stressed low-key staying up
The life I live I couldn't make it up
And my phone on silent I've been hidin
They want me to call but I been on an island
And all thats on my mind is how am I to find the way I'm tryin
Ayye I'm sick of all these hoes I'm sick of all the highs and the lows
Nowadays I don't know everytime I go I don't wanna be home
And I know girls just wanna have fun
And I just wanna have funds
So I stay to myself and I don't talk to no one

[Chorus:]
Not going out tonight I'm never leaving my room
I don't be hitting the clubs it only lead to my doom
Not feeling the outside I'd rather stay to myself
I don't need nobody help this shit not good for my health
But when I'm all alone I just be thinking so clear
Can't fathom nobody here don't wanna show all my tears
Cuz I'm down down down I'm tired of going down down down




 [Intro]
Damn, Mizzy Mauri got beats

[Verse]
Uh, old niggas and new niggas, now what's the difference?
All in the same boat in a stuck position
So when an old nigga talkin' I don't fuckin' listen
They don't know every day we make tough decisions
It seems though we is at a generational gap
Which bring conversation and a statement in fact
We can agree none of us is 'posed to make it in rap
I understand both sides, let me break it in half
Let's take it back when hip hop originated
And old niggas said it was wack, they couldn't take it
And called it a little trend, said it wouldn't last
Now it's the number one genre as the time passed
Young niggas won't listen and we know it
But old niggas always talk and never show it
You gotta practice what you preach and the classes that you teach
We'll eventually listen, my mind mentally prison, uh
Lately all my idols they been failin' me
Catchin' sexual assaults and some felonies
Then you want me to listen what you tellin' me
And wanna hate when we sing our little melodies
And other idols they be broke, get your funds in order
And Kanye West is a Trump supporter
Then we got R. Kelly and Bill Cosby
Who still probably got lil girls in the Hills lobby
And these supposed to be our heros? negro please
Old niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees
Only man I can trust is G-O-D
Not to mention Mos Def and Talib Kweli
Now I get it, y'all think new niggas really suck
And white kids fuckin' love it, lil silly ducks
But I know it's a lot of bullshit goin' on, I understand
But please don't complain without a plan
Ironically I wrote this whole song off a xan, nah I'm playin'
I'm just tryna be a fuckin' man
We see you old niggas as a lot of clowns
Not to mention our father figures was not around
So we all on tours and we hoppin' towns
We just need to sit down and find common ground
And it's soon to come, soon to come
Hip hop need balance like the moon and sun
It feel good when I wear Christian Louboutins
So I gotta drop music to accrue some funds
And I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest
But feedin' our families, lowering the crime yet
You want us to be separate and make a contest
Rappin' to stay up out the streets, shouldn't mind that
Stayin' out of prison and we sayin' fuck the system man
Rappin' is an outlet to go and get our dividends
Rather than out robbin' niggas, sellin' Ritalin
Old niggas bitter, y'all should love it when a nigga win
'Cause we came from the same struggle like Diddy and Dame Russell
Was teachin' and gained hustle, got rich, remained subtle
See I listen, see I listen
But Lil Dae-Dae water whippin' in the kitchen
Ready to flip a pack and bring it back, no submission
Gotta just go attack Lil Pump when you're dissin'
I understand both sides of the Ziploc
Y'all old niggas' time is comin' nigga, tick tock
I'ma still wear all my Gucci flip-flops
And the fuckin' diamond chain with the big rocks
And I'll be the greatest ever nigga, just watch
Cardi B got rich from Love & Hip Hop, haha

 Verse 1:
Now let me tell you bout this rap nigga who would never blow
He got all the Fucking talent yea the kid is hella dope
Couldn't see through all phoneys should've bought a telescope he was aiming too high so he had to settle low
Shopping label after label
Never signed him a deal
So retarded couldn't find the appeal
Didn't matter bout the work or how he rhyming with skills
Just another young nigga tryna grind for the bills
I mean I never was too tall or skilled to go shoot ball
I know i'm a move far
But dammit it's too hard
Imagined if you starved
But dreaming of shoes cars
And everyone around you is just wishing that you'd fall
But nah I refuse see a nigga came to carry a mission
People all from different places come with varied intentions
I'm a great and I knew that from the very beginning
But barely ambitious
Not to mention the larry I'm piffin
Ain't no friends people wanna you buried or prison
Me and all these others man it's scary the difference
I'm too ahead
Plus I alway kill tracks and I shoot em dead
The difference is blue and red
And I never salute the Fed
Cause the system so corrupt they just after the loot and bread I rather just lose my head
Think shay would pastor do instead
My guidance when I'm arriving
Through all of the flashing lights and
Love for the passion writing
But dying a crashing Viking

Hook
They never love you forreal- keep it subtle and chill- on my way to top about the bundles and mills- oh how what a wonderful feeling

Verse 2:
I'm thinking back to into time before my life was obsene
At times I be the only enemy just fighting my dreams
This rap shit is whole my life it's like a pipe to a fiend
Or better no metaphor it's like a mic to a me
I Reminisce my childhood and I ride my bike in the street
And we go straight to Marcus he get to slicing a beat
And we in school till 2
But shit was writing by 3
But that was back when it was fun it was enticing at least
And then I almost lost it all and used to cry in my sleep
And lay awake And always pray something the righteous could beat
Take me back to the days when I used to work at the mall
Take me back when I wasn't perfect at all
And when you climbing from the bottom it never hurts when you fall
Got some problems I been hiding but I'm working to solve
Don't let me blow and realize it wasn't worth the recalls
Lay a verse and into the earth and pop a perk till I'm off

Hook
They never love you forreal- keep it subtle and chill- on my way to top about the bundles and mills- oh how what a wonderful feeling




 [Intro]
The reason why black people are so addicted to materialism is, we use materialism to vicariously add wealth to ourselves
In other words, I don't think much of me. I ain't nobody. But if I put these Air Jordans on, I will be
If I buy this house in a white suburb, I will be. You understand? If I get this white woman, I will be
If I get this Louis Vuitton bag, I will be. So, we use wealth to replace self-worth

[Verse 1]
'Kay, some may think I'm insane. Just a sprinkle of brain
I'm on the brink of a change. Clearly the underdog, but the dude is winning
I'm onto new beginnings. Race and just choose your engine
And living confused with sinning
I done got some problems. Trying to save this Gotham
Niggas robbing and killing, but it's up to me to stop them
But it drives me insane. Niggas grimy and slimy
So find me a change. I'd rather buy me a Range
But I've been removed from popping tags. I'd rather cop a Jag
Damn, can't stop the swag. Open gates, lock 'em back
Got us all in prison. Income from writtens
Flow is so persistent, but the fame got me tripping
I done moved past the shoes, bags, the waves and do' rags
Your wave is due past. It's over, was too dragged
Never on a newcast in cars that move fast
Save up, don't lose cash to working for two sacks

[Hook] x2
'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting

[Verse 2]
I dreamed of earning mega millions, least a hundred or two
Penthouse apartment with just a wonderful view
Cameras flashing, paparazzi always front of the news
Gold chains and lots of Jordans, I'll have bundles to choose
I want diamonds and watches and straight shining on carpet
And my Bugatti, I park it. Issey Miyake my closet
And this money that I'm making, I'm gon' show it off
Odd are, couple years, I'm gon' blow it all
Can't resist the urge to spend. My problems are worsening
I'm going to church to sin. Please close the curtaining
Your whole life's been open, explain the pipe you're smoking
Plus, like the pills you're popping, the way to deal has got 'em
Straight up going insane. It ain't flowing the same
It seems like y'all start to change with the hoes and the fame
'Cause a nigga got some dollars, gotta change up my homies
Straight become a new person, while forgetting the old me

[Hook] x2
'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting

[Verse 3]
Fuck family, fuck friends. All I want is designer
Fuck a peace of mind and conscience with my leather recliner
Fuck attention and a Grammy, all I want is the dollars
Fuck being a role model, all I want is the sponsors
Sad that I sold my soul for money, the hoes and gold
I'm stressed and blowing dope because the Holy Ghost
Made the wrong decision, like the longest living
But got the strongest vision, clouded by thongs on women
But I know all these vices. Gotta stay enlightened
With the fame, I won't change. I'mma beat it, I'mma fight it
Blowing up the first year, talking 'bout the birth year
Becoming what I hate, a false prophet, that's my worst fear

[Hook] x2
'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting

[Outro]
Nigga, you just wait 'til I come up, nigga
Y'all- Y'all think I'm playing, like it's a joke or something?
When you see me come around in that Bentley truck and I'm fucking shit up
You're gonna want to ride with me
When you see me step out the car, huh, but let's see how I could run this
Huh, $500 on my ass
Huh, 700 on my feet
Uh, these niggas is cheap
I'm talking V.V.S. down to the motherfucking toe
I'm talking 'bout motherfucking 6 karat for the pinky ring, nigga




 [Intro: Malcolm X]
For instance, the average so-called Negro, he doesn't think that he can go into business and provide jobs for himself
And because of this, he thinks that he can only get a job from the White man
Or he can only get clothes from the White man, or he can only get food from the White man

[Verse 1]
Uh, we're takin' over the the racist motive, the hatred's older
The empire's retired, I'm just an ageist Yoda
Get some powder and baking soda, don't take the culture
They flip faster than racing motors. I'm made to blow up
If you don't understand now, then you will later
I'm from a place where they bust Glocks and steal paper
Nah, I'm talking assassination, they kill mayors
But can't overtake me because my skill's greater
Rap politician. Nominate my Congress
Never understood the Obama-hating nonsense
Black president. Dog, you hever had an option
'Cause, boy, I go monster way better than the Loch Ness
Let's get back to the subject: Blacks in the public
It seems like all other rap doesn't touch it
See, I tend to be the industry's redheaded stepchild
I've spoken too much. I'm surprised I'm not dead now

[Hook]
'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You see, these rap politicians are really something else
They start blowing all their funds moment they discover wealth
I mean, cop another belt. Shit, maybe even two
'Cause if you're not wearing designer, then crazy, you
When actuality, these guys are lazy goofs
They're the type to go dap a Piru in baby blue
Straight stupid. And these are the niggas who make music
Influence a generation, nobody relates to it
Nigga, now you see the problem? Do you see the trouble?
They're fucking up our brains for generational struggles
That black waitress works doubles just to get by
'Cause her son needs some Jordans, dog, just to get fly
I used to smoke an eighth a day, nigga, just to get high
And Nelqueisha didn't get the job that Jessica got
And when we get the 9 to 5s, we become satisfied
Amend the rap politics. Constitution ratified

[Hook]
'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah

[Verse 3]
It's time to overthrow this government. Military coup
'Cause if we don't soon, they'll still bury you
And the first plan of action: Man, y'all gotta stop the shooting
And no dickriding, that's technically prostitution
No backwards progression, always constant movement
Everything is in your hands, you just gotta grind to do it
But first things first needs diplomatic correction
'Cause rappers like me in the systematic oppression
Huey Newton of this rap shit. Y'all don't understand me
The same reason why Nas and Snoop still don't have a Grammy
Why you gotta blow thousands when you fly to Miami?
And why you can't be a rapper if you drive in a Camry?
They make it uncool to budget, want us blowing our cash
Then Uncle Sam makes us broke again when taking our tax
So depressed from this hex they supply in prescriptions
Modern day drug war, these rappers fighting addiction

[Hook]
'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah

[Outro: YBN Nahmir]
Listen, man, I ain't gonna lie, this shit is ass
This shit is not good
I need some coonery in my life
I'm tired of this black power, woke shit
A'ight? You gonna have to cut all that shit out, B
Seriously
I needs the crank
Yes, that's what I'm looking for, the word "crank"
I needs that
That is not this. This shit is ass. Turn it off
Not a good song
(Ass)
Trash
(Garbage)
Garbage
(Boo-boo, stank-stank)
Nigga
Motherfuckin'

 [Verse]

First off just take a breather
Never fall into the make believers
Tryna build empire like Jason Jeter
Go gorilla on the track, great ape Vegeta
You get what I'm saiyan (saying)
No Bape Adidas
Tryna run up the numbers till I break the meter
Til' you face the heater, and you fake a seizure
Dog I gotta blow cuz my patience leaving
Two steps for the one time
Make them right hooks, and them punchlines
This is sorta like my NFL combine
When we wake up tomorrow pray for sunshine
It's a brighter day for tomorrow
In the trenches they living in sorrow
Fresh gear 'member days we would borrow
Damn this shit changing they shooting out Largo

'Member days was dreaming of Bentleys
Gucci, Prada shit I'll even wear Fendi
Fuck up a check when I cop my Balenci's
Broke and proud now I'm down to my pennies
Nigga been through a lot through the past year
On the road the riches on my last gear
Sick of dumb ass jobs was a cashier
Mixtapes get thrown in the trash here
Ironically they recycling bars
Me and Toonsz spending nights in garage
Hit up Parris he live right next to Nas
Use to trap in towers now I'm Eiffel to y'all
Money growing, getting taller
Jeans tight, pockets smaller
Thank mama the way I was brought up
Living life but I never got caught up

[Hook]

When you coming up you evolving
Member days we was balling
Starry night, the sky's falling
But everybody has a calling
I'm still searching for mine too
Plain sight from the sky view
Soul searching they'll find you
But got nowhere to hide too

And so I'm running away, I'm running away
Always running away, I'm running away
Gotta stop running away, I'm running away
Can't keep running away, running away

[Verse]

Been through it all but I'm too involved
Copped my team goldlinks now my crew can floss
And them niggas hating bad what I do to y'all
And don't even worry bout what my shoes will costs
So u might afford it but my life distorted
I fight the horror with he mic recording
Bro stay with 45s like he Michael Jordan
You gotta have drive I'm the type to floor it
So I'm speeding down life's highway
Tryna cop a benz in my driveway
I ain't been alseep in bout 5 days
And I'm gettin top from my side bae
Sometimes I hate the life that I'm living
Gramma whipping pies in that kitchen
Uncle be pushing weight, think I'm kidding
Rap niggas lie, I lie to my women. Aye!
Walk in Barney's just to fuck up a check
Dead broke now you stuck up in debt
Take a flick, double cuff just to flex
Upgrade my life from the shuttle to jets
Go from noodles to steak, I got food on my plate
Pave my own way you just do what they say
Y'all follow wave stay true my way
Ain't no waiting tomorrow I do it today

[Hook]

When you coming up you evolving
Member days we was balling
Starry night, the sky's falling
But everybody has a calling
I'm still searching for mine too
Plain sight from the sky view
Soul searching they'll find you
But got nowhere to hide too

And so I'm running away, I'm running away
Always running away, I'm running away
Gotta stop running away, I'm running away
Can't keep running away, running away

 [Verse]
I need this song to blow up and get plays fast
Just look at where my grandmomma stay at
Graduated school, see the debt I gotta pay back
Money getting rocky, I need some more of that ASAP
So where the tape all the nigga working on
That's why all my verses long cause the hurt is strong
I told them I was the greatest and not a word was wrong
I was searching for my purpose and I murdered souls
What's the verdict? Mind's lurking, that's the hurt I'm on
Rappers don't want beef, eat that sirloin
What's that steak in my fate in my verbal throne
No pun intended, a nigga was born to run the business
Account balances always tellin me my funds is spending
Tryna have a beach house, invite tons of women
Dive in a water slide, ain't no fun in swimming
And you know they from exotic places
Black and white girls, man I'm not a racist
A house so big couldn't find a basement
We tryna move up but we climb adjacent
Previously these goals is just manifested
Cause right now my pockets looking anorexic
Got a vision for my future that my plans are hectic
Nigga, mass appeal

 [Intro]
Eee-oooh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Uh uh
They said check at the tank
Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that's ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

[Verse]
Seen the red and blue lights, and I got pulled over
Redneck-ass cop asked me was I sober
I said hell nah nigga, stupid question to ask
I got a half pound of weed in the messenger bag
But I couldn’t tell ‘em that, I was wantin' to laugh
That's the number one rule, don’t be flauntin' your pack
And stop asking all these questions, now I'm tauntin' yo ass
And, if you want to search my car, you need a warrant for that
As soon as I said that stupid shit, my gun had slip into his grip
My nigga, I plead the fifth, I don't mean to diss man, but I gotta dip
He said "what in tarnation," hit the gas, I'm car racing
Plus I'm high in the sky, gas got me stargazin'
So here's a little advice, my sugar n’ spice, and you can get nice
Free my nigga T-Mac, that shit is so whack, they tryna indict
I just paid off all my debt, I'm gettin' them checks, it's changin' my life
I need a little respect, just copped a Patek, just look at my ice
So he ran up, "put yo hands up", you in handcuffs
You done lost your mother fuckin' head like you got dandruff
Woman lie, a nigga lie, fuck the cell, that shit is dry
Why you pull me over doing 60 in a 55?
All y'all is suspects, you knew that homes
Five niggas in the car, and y'all got durags on
Plus y'all bumpin' all the really loud new rap songs
That's three fuckin' strikes, I wanna go back home
How the fuck my straps slip, I be grounded and tight
He said, "boys it look like y'all at the County tonight
And the canines comin', you can stop with the jokes
So while y'all in there tonight, don't be droppin' the soap"

[Bridge]
I know that you hate me, I know that you jealous
I know you crazy, hiding behind an umbrella
Man I know I'm a target, shit I know I’m a threat
And I know y'all tryna stop me, 'cause you know I'm up next, nigga

[Chorus]
I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that’s ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to ten, hey!




 [verse 1]

My whole life for hours I been writing convictions
Temptation to striking a Christian
While he fighting position
Almighty forgiven, while looking for a righteous religion
Hopefully getting my people out of lightest positions
And then, one that maybe don't have cost a dime or cent
Where I gotta pay tithe to hear common sense
Rhyming since, like a god and shit in my consciousness
Some say he insane and I'm just out of it
Cause wack rappers that's ass backwards is getting clout
Taking pictures with guns they don't know shit about
It's giving me not the bittest doubt I'm the realest out
They begging me to hear him out cus' they fear me now
Why try to act hardcore or hard for
They hopping that I break a leg no Paul George I'm so fly that I sky walk like Star Wars
Push so hard For Waldorf then fall forward

[Chorus]

I mean in actuality we all stuck in a frame
Can't get out so we just busted in chains
And all these rap niggas straight frontin for fame
Stupid that they think it's something to gain
(Background) Welcome to the Jungle, the jungle the muthafuckin jungle YEA !

[verse 2]

To all you fuck niggas who bust triggas, wassup witcha
Kill ya own kind and reading corrupt scriptures
See the through the light despite the rough picture
And spoke to the death and kept the tough figure cause nowadays they doing madness shit the cops shoot the blackest kid and claim it was accident
Then they wonder why we tired of the cops they riding the block next thin you know roger got shot
No Coincidence horrific shit
I'm tired  I'm sick of this
Ironcally no witnesses
Was written in genesis
Even TV dawg it's all mind control
Rather have designer clothes
Then honor roll
All worthless new slaves to Michael Kors purses
Led by corrupt leaders and false churches
Healed by my sharp flows and raw verses
Not one to judge though I'm far perfect

[Chorus]

I mean in actuality we all stuck in a frame
Can't get out so we just bested in chains
And all these rapper niggas straight frontin for fame
Stupid that they think it's something to gain
(Background) Welcome to the jungle, the jungle the motherfuckin jungle YEA !

[verse 3]

See you gotta grip the steel have dribble skills or get a deal
I chose option number 3 cause my shit appeals
Got everybody respect because this niggas real
See we gotta diet better eating shitty meals
I guess Afro American starter pack is jail time high cholesterol then a heart attack
The harder facts
Is that lying is just apart of rap
Cold bastard, dope rapper
And artifact




 [Hook: YBN Cordae]
See I don't know about this fake love
I'm not fucking with it
When you gotta cut your friends off
That's a tough decision
But I did it I'll do it again
I'm not no fool no pretend
Tryin' get a coupe or a Benz
You choosin' to sin
Pop said you losin' you win
Balenci, my shoes is a trend

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae & Simba]
Spinnin' the bin
I got more diesel than Vin
It's Ruga the gang bitch we win
Fuckin' on twins
Ima let bro fuck her friend
She thought he got two for the ten
She say the way we switch it shit is vicious
Bank account lookin' healthy I'm nutritious
Fuck em they never helped me had to get it
Now niggas gettin' wealthy should have dent it
I keep it with me for niggas suspicious
We pull up with dracos and we get to hittin'
Fuck a hoe, I put my man on a mission
I get work from out of state, fuck tuition
I came from whippin' babies in the kitchen
Bro knock your grandma off and I ain't kiddin'
My niggas clippin'
Hi-Tech what we sippin'
We waitin' on shipments
That's just how we livin'
D-D-D-Damn I got the mack with the strap
Might bust a move with T-Mac and Lil Zach
Be with some niggas smoke you like the pack
Swervin' the Act team on my back
Leave the game never play quarterback
Try to swerve on my block gettin' jacked
Don't do no songs cause ya'll niggas whack
So if you want features just give me a stack

[Hook: YBN Cordae]
Gotta know about this fake love
I'm not fucking with it
When you gotta cut your friends off
That's a tough decision but I did it I'll do it again
I'm not no fool no pretend
Tryin' get a coupe or a Benz
You choosin' to sin
Pop said you losin' you win
Balenci my shoes is a trend

[Verse 2: YBN Cordae & Simba]
Damn I go too ballistic
My new whip that shit futuristic
"Fuck a Ruga" their shooters hittin'
I made a new decision
I don't fuck with these losers snitchin'
In the courts they be too specific
I be scorchin' I'm chasing bands gettin' fortunes
Hit the plug got a new orlean
23 shots Michael Jordan
Gloc' hit a nigga George Foreman
Sellin' the perky's the corbins
Hopped off the porch with the Gloc' in my shorts
Dressed and had weight no socks in my drawers
But the cops on the block
Ain't no stoppin' the force
So I had to get straight cause my pops he was poor
Tryin' eat steak and the lobster of course
But I rather get it right ain't no robbin' the stores
Now my brother is missing just another in prison
Can't be me then my mother is trippin'
I gotta make it fuck ya'll I despise the hatin'
And we started inside the basement
Got brodi back in placement
Gettin' money now your father hatin'
Bussin' jugs we ain't conversatin'
Chopper gon' cut down the population
Any nigga can get nominated
Got them bombs in the trap
That's abomination
Shoot a nigga fuck a combination
Coolin' but Simba he's not as patient
Smoke presidential inauguration
We cook up crack just like Ronald Regan
Cut niggas off that's a operation

[Hook: YBN Cordae]
Gotta know about this fake love
I'm not fucking with it
When you gotta cut your friends off
That's a tough decision but I did it I'll do it again
I'm not no fool no pretend
Tryin' get a coupe or a Benz
You choosin' to sin
Pop said you losin' you win
Balenci my shoes is a trend




 [Intro, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
Yes, sir
It's the L.A. Leakers, man
That's right
Power 106, liftoff show
Justin Credible, Sourmilk
We've been invaded by the DMV, man
We had to stay, yeah
What's up man, what we doin'?
Oh, alright bet (ah)
Right into it, let's get right, this history shit
Remember this
Classic moments on liftoff with the L.A. Leakers

[Verse 1, Instrumental: Kendrick Lamar, "DUCKWORTH."]
(Okay, uh)
Why everybody always seem to give me half effort?
I guess I need more clout, I know I rap better
I gotta stack cheddar, apply max pressure
Ski mask, black sweater, the daily attire
It made me acquire effort, my lazy is fired
God damn, why the fuck do I feel so entitled?
Beef comin', I take the high road, my life spirals
I'm longevity chasing, you overnight viral
I fight rivals, and stand taller than five Eiffels
Used to trap in the tower, made a stack in an hour
Money, immaculate power, is what we all desire
I got a passion, raw as fire that can fan the flame
Fuck your company name, homie, your brand is lame
I know the panic came, when I arrived
Soon controllin' the game, one of the flyest guys
Mama, please dry your eyes, you might decide
That your son a king
A crazy youngin' with a ton of dreams
I've seen a bunch of things that would make the average man commit suicide
But God know I had a plan
They sellin' souls, nigga, grab a stand
And for a bargain and a half a xan
You can buy the next mumble rapper, who
Had to humble after the label dropped him and robbed him (woah)
Game is the Gotham, my vice is sex
Dodgin' the Feds
My foot on the pedal,  my brake in the cycle
Got the heart of a rebel
You see, the way it gotta be
I stack a lot of cheese
And I keep my mob deep with rap prodigy
Never say my name, spit flame, who as hot as me?
Bro snatched a chain from a lame, diabolically
Imma be myself, with the wealth, no apologies
Never fuckin' switch it up, this rap shit ridiculous
They can't get rid of us, they tried it all
Every power has its rise and fall
Hear my phone, I'll decline the call
Please, do not disturb
Got a presidential flow, I'm Barack with words
New age, but they still puttin' rocks in herb
Pray to God, and I know that's gonna block the curse
'Cause I'm ill, nigga

[Interlude, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
Okay!
Hold up, hold up
Let's keep going, let's keep going
Keep goin? Yeah, what's next, nigga?
YBN Cordae is here
Yeah, I'm here to stay for a while
With the L.A. Leakers
Ooh! Ooh! Came with diversity
The Los Angeles Leakers
Let's switch it up a little bit, let's switch it up a little bit
Let's show them how we do this
Only real MCs can come on L.A. Leakers show
YBN Cordae (yeah)

[Verse 2, Instrumental: Lil Pump, “Esskeetit”]
I need a new Bugatti for the few who got me
Killin' beats is a ruthless hobby
You say your shooters caught me, never do what's floppy
Drop a kid like they do karate
I'll be the first, never lied in rap
I am a great, no denying that
I spit the high on the fire tracks
I cannot wait to blow up, when they say he acquire racks
I switch the style, and I make it easy
I changed my friend, because they was greedy
I'm makin' money, they pay to meet me
I give a fuck if a hater's scheming
I gotta grind and make every dollar
My money stronger than Larry Lobster
I work that magic, that Harry Potter
You niggas scared I'll bury ya, ayy

All my niggas rich, essketit (huh)
Just dropped a bag at Lenox, (huh)
New black whip, all tinted (huh)
New black whip, no renting (ayy)
Kill the freestyle on the Leakers, (huh)
Used to get head from the teachers, (ayy)
Smokin' that gas, no reefer (ayy)
Shit loud like the speakers (ayy)
Look, mama proud like Penny
Cracked the code, no DaVinci, (ayy)
Look, all my niggas wear Givenchy
Choker on me, no lynching (ayy)
Look, plenty ya bitches is fine
When ya cash out on designer (ayy)
Look, I need a bitch like Madonna
We'll take a trip out to China (ayy)

[Interlude, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
The Los Angeles Leakers
YBN Cordae
Let's keep it goin', man!
He flexin' on ya'll right now, MCs
Let's keep it goin', it's the L.A. Leakers, man!
Ain't no cell phones in sight, this real hip hop shit!
Woo, alright, alright
Let's get it, no
And he said no cell phones
We gotta end it with a bang, man!
YBN Cordae! History shit!
The Los Angeles Leakers
Damn, this shit drop hard!
It's classic, still slaps!

[Verse 3, Instrumental: Method Man & Redman, “Da Rockwilder”]
Alright
Check it out, listen (uh)
Blessed with a mind to help me shine to the throne
Didn't have any support, I had to grind on my own
And where I'm from, you get sprayed like the finest cologne
So if they shoot, you better duck, unless you dyin' alone
Consider yourself lucky if you listen to this
I told you I was the greatest, I predicted this shit
It's funny 'cause the same girl suckin' and lickin' the dick
Will go home and just start huggin' and kissin' the kids
And they always back for more, why they bother us?
I told you I'll call back, as soon as your father does
And when he doesn't, I know it build up a lot of lust
You do it all to make him proud, but that's still not enough
But fuck it, that's just the art of intimidation
See, fuck the judge and the litigation
And why these niggas hatin', 'cause I be fowin' like irrigation
They fear the nation
Had to rush and drop the tape, because the meal was patient
No pun intended, I'm at the doctors, I'm ill as fuck
I'm healin' up, they not feelin you, you not real enough
And to be honest dog, ya really suck
Find another hobby, ASAP
Please give it up
Please, nigga
Y'all niggas suck, like shit man
I ain't fuckin' with the rap niggas, yo

[Outro, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
You at the doctor, you ill?
Yeah! Hahaha!
YBN Cordae
See how we doin' it with the L.A. Leakers, man!
Classic material, L.A. Leakers' liftoff show
Justin Credible, Sourmilk
Power 106 is #1 for hip hop
