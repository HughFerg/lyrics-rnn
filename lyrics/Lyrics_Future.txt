 [Hook: Future]
I got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My little brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went too pop
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a tear drop
A bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppas
And when you matchin' head to toe, they say you too fly
Got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2pac

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a bandana 'round my head screaming thug life
I get faded off them Xans and a muddy drink
Got a bandana round my head, like I’m Soulja
Keep that choppa on a nigga, like Magnolia
Put some blonde in my dread, I went to pop
For my brother 16th birthday, bought him a new Glock
These niggas taking off your head for a new watch
My young nigga, he ain’t scared, he want a new body
I done fucked around and cashed out on some new exotics
Bitch ain’t never speak, now englo, I went too tropic
Tie bandana ‘round my head, like I’m Birdie
I left my dope with my grandma, had her servin'

[Hook]
I got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac

My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppas
And when you matchin' head to toe, they say you too fly
Got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2pac

[Verse 2: Future]
These hood bitches loving a nigga, like I'm Alpo
My lil' cousin got that yoppa on him and he broke
Got designer on my collar, like I'm Bon Jovi
I got all these problems, I just bought a bunch of doddi
These niggas killing everybody's bitches, fuck that dirty pussy
These niggas ain't used to no pimping, they gon' pay for pussy
Got that bandana 'round my head like a rebel boy
All this molly in my system, I can see the devil
And I’m playin' round wit' these presidents
Still tote a one-hundred round wit' a felony
Keep a few kilos on me nephew, these links on me, they cuban
Got banana clips on banana clips, on banana clips

[Hook]
I got a bandana 'round my head, like I'm 2Pac

 [Intro]
Zaytoven
Every now and then, you know what I'm sayin'
Most of the majority of the time
You dig
We in that mode

[Verse 1]
This is a moment of clarity
Everything VV's, I'm gone to the maximum
Young nigga flood out a 'axima
Flawless the face, then run through a pack of them
Everything classical, everything magical
When they was checking my catalogue
Eating on caviar, smash on a stallion
Draped in medallions, yeah
Depending on the caliber, put on the passenger
Whatever time, wherever I was at
Look on the calendar, yeah we compatible
I have her flying wherever I'm at
You astronomical, way too phenomenal
To not have her naked where I land
I got a second option, and fourth
And fifth one wherever a nigga staying
I had it falling right out of my pocket
When I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin'
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France
She caramel, without getting a tan
I need to pay her when I get the chance
Gave her some drip, gave her a whole lot of splash
Talkin' that shit, he get smoked like a blunt
Took a few Pakistanians to lunch
Got some little slim shit in Milan
These niggas be hatin', putting on a front

[Chorus]
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
I took a little E, got red bottoms all on my feet
I ran it up, I got your baby mama knee deep
She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse
When I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe
I was thinking like, "Jeez," she done got a lil slob on my tee
I done took a little E, I fucked her and made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm painting this carpet green
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page

[Verse 2]
Doing it on a chinchilla, oh yeah
You fucking a couple of strippers together
Shawty my rider, she down for whatever
Y'all give her capital murder, her swagger killer
Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer
I put her in a Patek, I put her in the Cs
I'm on a whole 'other level with her
Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they could all come and sleep with us
We don't do nothing that's normal, everything we do is super gigantic
We don't put on fugazi, everything we wear super Titanic
I just caught me a wave, feel like a nigga done jumped in Atlantic
One hell of a car collection, pulling it up, it's panoramic
Picked her up in a Cayenne, soon as she got in she got nothing on

[Chorus]
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
I took a little E, got red bottoms all on my feet
I ran it up, I got your baby mama knee deep
She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse
When I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe
I was thinking like, "Jeez," she done got a lil slob on my tee
I done took a little E, I fucked her, made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm painting this carpet green
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm painting this carpet green
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days
She like bitches anyways, so we been on the same damn page
Money get made, bitches don't ever get saved
Saint Laurent shades, cookin' up dope, gettin' paid
Trying to get laid, she been with me 31 days

[Chorus]
And everything I do for my gang gang (My gang gang!)

You got booked for a controlled substance, I want more drank (Yeah!)
It's like a funeral when they see me, 'cause these hoes faint (Yeah!)
I done got used to dead homies, I stay in the bank (Yeah!)
Ain't got one more tear to shed on me, all my son's straight (Yeah!)
I put Casino in my will, nigga, I'm a die with this cake (Freebandz!)

[Verse 2]

Waking up fresh, that's Kodak

Real street nigga, you know that

[Hook]
I think 56 nights crazy
I think 56 nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I did 56 broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I did 56 broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I took 56 bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand man shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation

[Verse 1]
Money keep a nigga motivated
Molly keep a nigga motivated
Percocet keep em motivated
Good drank keep a nigga motivated
Lortabs on my conversation
Talk a lot of bands then we conversatin'
I was on my way to Rice Street
In the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Tryna sell some dope and eat caviar
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We've been flossing in medallions
We ain't nothing but some Talibans
I pull up right now and embarrass ya
I've just been hanging with savages
Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, 1 hunnid
I go on The Bluff it's 1 hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle
I done put in some work and they love me
When I drink out the cup, it's so dirty
Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a 4 in a cup it was breakfast
Sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

[Hook]
I think 56 nights crazy
I think 56 nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy

I could still see the scar on a nigga hand man shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation

[Verse 2]
Promethazine took my concentration
To another level then I elevated
Diamonds hanging on me I'm intoxicated
Diamonds hanging off me I'm intoxicated
Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands
On a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker
I'm bout to pass out in this motherfucker
I'm bout to pass out in this motherfucker
This bitch exotic than a motherfucker
These bitches  do anything for me

[Hook]
I think 56 nights crazy

 [Intro]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day off
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winning shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy

[Verse 1]
Fuck poppin' trunk lay the chopper, right on your lap
Fuck all these comments, I was just sellin' crack
I blame the streets for the way I was raised
I cannot sleep with these demons behind me
'Xans, they takin' over all your thoughts
If you get in the way of my plans, I'ma knock you out
I laced my Sunkist with Molly
I fucked that bitch, she in college
I gave her game and bags
Put that world on her tongue, she a swallower

[Bridge]
I got the power of my dollar
You know the power of a dollar
Do you know the power of a dollar?
I know the power of a dollar
(I know the power of a dollar)

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day out
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winning shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy

[Verse 2]
I'm absolutely goin' brazy
They try to stop me, I ain't hesitatin' (don't stop)
Unwrap the bag and take this medication
I crumple herb on the application
I put a circuit in Kate like a waitress
She gave me somethin', that's one hell of a facial
I wasn't nervous, I hold it an' sprayed it
I know you bogus, I seen this for days (I know you bogus, fuck)
I'm absolutely gettin' revenge, I absolutely gotta win (yeah)
I'm comin' through in the clutch (yeah)
Burn the money up like a Dutch (Dutch)
VVSs, no cut (woo)
These Gucci flops like chucks (Gucci)
Got that throat from a slut (who?)
Best feelin' in the world (best feelin')
When you come through the hood
Ridin' in a foreign and you got your new girl (whoa)
While you pourin' on syrup

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day out
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winning shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy

 [Intro]
I'm poppin' my shit every morning (Poppin' my shit)
Then I go to paradise
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus]
Cough syrup got me dozin' off, I can see you in my afterlife
He snapped the clip in then drove off
He know somebody's 'bout to die tonight
I leave the baddies in the house, superfly
That Draco sittin' in the couch, I'm on fire
But I don't fuckin' miss it though, I'm gon' slide
I think out loud, I'ma get my money and I don't get tired

[Verse 1]
Sit in the back of the Phantom and have a good night
And have to take nothing off, lit up like a light
I can't see nothin' in the way, was going outta sight
I get her lace on daily basis, she my type
I pop my shit and live lavish, I never switch sides
You go to college, get a crib off the clothes I buy
We get on the top of the fuckin' Hills off the Sunset Drive
I'm a product of the field, I'm just in my disguise
Hit the trippin' off a pill but don't give me some cake
I've been jumpin' on these Lears, that's the way I'ma chase 'em
Franklins comin' by the layers, that's the way we gon' make 'em
She don't know when I'ma pop 'em so she gotta sleep naked
I can tell the way they treat me, they gon' say I'm the greatest
Ain't no tellin' if I leave you, I'ma ever come back (Pluto)
Ain't gon' never let a disloyal bitch hold me back (No)
I done Goyard my bags so we could hold my racks
And all the love I got for Atlanta, I got the same for Chiraq (Yeah)
You can't help who you love nigga (Can't help who you love)
That's why God made thug niggas (Yeah, straight up)

[Chorus]
Cough syrup got me dozin' off, I can see you in my afterlife
He snapped the clip in then drove off
He know somebody's 'bout to die tonight
I leave the baddies in the house, superfly
That Draco sittin' in the couch, I'm on fire
But I don't fuckin' miss it though, I'm gon' slide
I think out loud, I'ma get my money and I don't get tired

[Verse 2]
I think out loud, I'ma get my checks, fuck you niggas
I need to get it off my chest, fuck you niggas
I got the hittas in the cut, I'm still that nigga
I got her flattin' out her tummy, I'm that nigga (Super)
Take my time, my new bank account gettin' taller
I flood-out Richard, that gon' cost me at least a quarter (Least a quarter)
I done been in my bag lately and I been poppin my collar (My bag)
I got a good taste in bitches 'cause they swallow (Yeah)
I done birthed a lotta lil' niggas, I'm their father (Future)
Can't be responsible, how you move? 'Cause I taught ya (I can)
Keep it a thousand, ok bool
That's how I was brought up (One thousand)
Lil' nigga had to pay his dues, man, slaughter (free Lu)
9 bracelets on me, baby, hold on, wait (Hold on)
9 rings on me, baby, hold on, wait (I'm the champ)
Got that Glizzy on me, baby, hold on wait (That's a Glock)
Don't be shy with that pussy, hold on, wait (Yeah, mine)
90 vibes at the crib, pick a race (Yes)
I would've said at least one hundred to play it safe (Robbin' the safe)
When it comes to loud, I'ma roll with Grade A (Grade A)
I don't go outta town unless I'm fillin' up the safe
I done crocodile my Pradas, just to hold my racks
And all the love I got for Atlanta, I got the same for Chiraq
You can't help who you love, nigga
That's why God made thug niggas

[Outro]
You can't help who you love, nigga
I'm poppin' my shit every mornin'
Then I go to paradise
Can't help who you love, nigga
That's why God made thug niggas

Got to watch my own back, fuck around and get stabbed in that
Hollygrove my habitat, wish I could bring Rabbit back
Hundred shots come after that, call a ho a ho and a rat a rat
I said a hundred shots come after that, ain’t looking good like cataracts
I'ma buy me a Cadillac, cause I don’t see where I’m lacking at
Them feds tryna throw me in the box, I’m like fuck that, throw Jack in that
I'ma get that pussy wet, her other nigga just dampen that
He buy shit, he pamper that, she tapping out when I’m tapping that
Tryna get as high as me nigga, then where the fuck is your scaffold at?
Niggas flip facts like acrobats, I click clack, what comes after that?

[Hook: Future]
I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that
You stack the racks on them stacks and commas come after that
Yeah you took a few shots but you know we’ll come after that
I smell that mula, that fetti, I’m coming after that
Same for my Beamer and Benz, see what come after that
I’m living this life of sin, what’s coming after that?

Tripping on me cause I’m in another city
But when I come back home, baby I wanna see you
I could cop that Gucci you still say that ain’t enough
I could give you money for your hair and your nails
Just still tripping start acting up
Why you think I’m lying? I’m on the radio, fuck the rumors
Sick of hearding you a pitiful maneuvers
The one I make you say where didy go to …
I just gotta go and do a video with Future
I know it’s hard to forgive and forget
About the time that you saw me with a girl in the car
You think I’m fucking everybody
But I be on the grind when I be up in the world
I’m a star, I want you to be a part of my astrology
Cause I had to learn that you was a part of me
So I hope you accept my apology
So I wanna say, baby I’m sorry

You were just like my twin
When I’m lying to you
It’s like I’m lying to my friends
You ain’t gonna never leave
It ain’t what I tell myself
No matter how much I fucked up

What is love with a nigga with a heart of steel
Ain’t got no trust for no ho
That’s how I live
When it’s bout the crib
And got an extra condo
I couldn’t tell you bout the stripper
That was going psycho

Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lumber
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before
You can’t dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

[Verse 1]
Cop a H3 with the big tires
I got money that will never expire
Took a chance and I became a idol
Who can do what I do, no rival
It’s just me and all my benjamins
Y’all start right, you need to experience this
4 bitches at once, try that now that’s an experiment
Then I don’t wanna be nowhere but inside this music bizz
I work the work and flip the work and bought me a big crib
I could make the first down to first song the bottom of my list
Talking piss poor, broke when you start thinking you ain’t shit
And then you make some millions off a planet that don’t exist

[Hook]
Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer
I pull up that shit would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

Take your places you thought you’ll never go
I’ma give em some they ain't seen before

[Verse 2]
Don’t mention even be explained
Bitch I rep that rich game
Close your mouth bitch you can go far
You know what it’s like to roll with a star
I know open doors I can get you chauffeur
We can drive around I don’t touch the wheel
I put swag on you and you taking off, outta here
I got diamonds chains and they put up like souvenirs
I don’t know what to do with money but to stack it up
Came a long way from watching out for them ups drugs
I just seen on drawn the package it’s on the porch
I’m just doing my exercise, finessing the sport

[Hook]
Have you ever seen a drop top Hummer

You dropping them dimes, you dropping them dimes, you dropping them dimes
You look like you lying, you look like you lying, you look like you lying
We do this Sunday to Sunday
Sun up to the sun down
Look like I stepped on the runway
They try to tell me to calm down
Peep how I came in the game and I start rocking that Tom Ford
We don't what we be saying, we just be yelling out Bonjour
We don't what we be saying, we just be yelling out Bonjour
I like to play with them bands right before I do the encore
I like to play with the cash, go to Laurent and spaz

You slangin' that iron, you slangin' that iron, you toting that iron
You pressin' the issue, you pushing the gas, you making 'em violate
I'm dropping the top on that foreign, I zig and I zag I'm all on the grass
I did what I had to pass, you niggas you better go back to your stash
I did what I had to do, I ran in that bitch I didn't have a mask
I did what I should have did, survive through the trenches and look like a man
I sit at the throne, I sit at the throne, you niggas ain't nothing but some clones
I sipping that Dom Perignon, when I'm at the store they ringing me up
My bitch on her bitch, got her eatin' it up
I done gained a little weight and I'm keeping it up
Step in them Christians I done came out the mud
I'm flexing on purpose when I'm in the club

I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya
I'm a keep it pimpin' with ya
Don't you come at me with issues
Ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya
You can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the Fourteenth ain't tryna fuck no hoe tryna know me
Know the fuck my wodie
Already smashed the homie
Half of these b*thches phony
Say they need a lil sum like (???)
Ms.Braxton you action, stop actin'

[Verse 2]
Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain
You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain
He don't care nun about no fame, he addicted to the game
Some niggas rob, some niggas slang, do whatever to maintain
Travel all the way to Waco, get them numbers for the low-low
Bigger the risk, the bigger the check, we watch for po-po
Make sure you keep your eyes on, when you're drivin down 1-0
That interstate ain't no joke when you're ridin with Coco
When you got hands like these you can count money with your eyes closed
(???)
Half of these niggas front fo'
Bitches for extra convo
Really plugged in with Migo
Go blind and still can see, no




 Big Boi's Verse:
A killer gonna be a killer
Thats regardless
Of the fact that i'm tin man heartless
No love for ya baby less your walking through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin through your wife beater
You the *?*
She's doing daddy fat sacks soon as I meet her
Get it?
Meat her
Cut to the chase like a cheetah cuz she want that PETA
Piper (pipe her) down
Gon wife her clown
When so many niggas a wiped her down
You hope that she is gonna turn her life around
About face
A full 180
A ho into a house wife thats yo lady
And me
I never give a nothing but a dope baby
Wit the good times
And the dope dick
She loves the way I talk
And my blow slick
**ain't no way around it**
**yo-yo-yo-your bitch is in love with my dick**
But BIG don't love her at all
Let a monkey nigga pay dem bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA
TNA
We the A, A A A

Shackled in chains, bout some petty change

Back in bag (back in yo bag?)
Been gone so long
Almost forgot what I had
Wipe me down, With a rag (with a rag?)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back
Back in my bag (back in yo bag)
Been gone so long almost forgot who I am
Wipe me down
With a rag (with a rag)
God is good my girl is bad
I was gone but now I’m back

[Verse 1]

Back in my bag like a ransom
Back in my bag like I’m snacking
I go through a lot so my heart is heavy
I’m moving weight like a fat kid

I feel like an improper fraction
There’s no in between I’m either black or white




I guess I feel like Michael Jackson
I’m the man like Pac
I’m well trained on the track
They make you pick the cotton then sell shirt
But leave that trash on the rack
I don’t rap I attack
I’m on point like a tack
I see some people getting mad
Cause I was gone but now I’m back

[Hook]

I’m back in
They lookin like who let them cats in
But I'm not a cat, I'm not a dog
If I'm not the goat, I'm a dragon
They ducking the fade they quackin
I know some grown men who wanna act 10
Cause they know they’ll never
Be the man again
I just act like I’m a mannequin
Because they don’t deserve no reaction
They funny actin, it got my laughin
I’m back in my bag
Like I’m packing
I travel cuz I'm in the NBA and y'all Pac-10
I don't have it all, but I'm not lacking
I’m not harassing
I’m just asking
If I can take her out like an extraction
I got so much drive but I’m back in
Reverse
Play this song at the church
God is great, God is good
My girl is bad, and I’m worse
I stomp on the beat like I'm Kirk




I wear it out like some merch
God said the last gon' be first
So I got it poppin like a perk
You can’t play this game from the bleachers
So I practice everything I’m preaching
Don’t call me fam cause we ain’t related
If you got my blood it’s cause you leaching
I be on stages but I don’t act
I’mma last forever but don’t got no tats
I feel like Jesus gone play this song
When the sky crack like
I was gone but now I’m back

[Hook]
I’m back

Got more ice than a water fountain
And I'm rolling baby, with a Nike sign and two naked ladies
Can't help but floss, nigga, I'm a codeine boss, nigga
On good drank, with a full tank, and a big bank (skrrrrt)
I'm so in the paint, I cut you up with a shank [Straight up]
I'm throw up fingers, whenever I talk to you
And I'm so geeked up right now, I can't even talk to you (Pluto!)
You featherweight, I'm like a hawk on you (Freebandz!)
Send her to my section, I'm gonna spread some sauce on you

[Hook: Future]
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
And I ain't even a shooter, nigga
I'm so geeked up, I want to shoot the nigga
I'm back on E
I done throwed back a double
In the club, fucking bitches, me and Trouble
I'm back on E

[Verse 3]
[Future]
I'm on all type of drugs, I'm draped up with the thugs
And I don't conversate, cause I converse back with the plug
We handle good business, We smoke good loud
We swap out bad bitches, cause ain't none of them ours

[Trouble]
I'm trouble trouble, baby, Geeked up, looking sour
[How long you been rolling fool?] Way too many hours
Pass me the Aquafina, Can't do nothing with a single
I done popped so many pills, you can't know how I feel

[Hook: Future]
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now

And I ain't even a shooter, nigga

Roll it 'fore it flood, come where I begin
Broad niggas and I cheat on my ex
Pretty titties, I might skeet on her breasts
Skeet on her breasts

One night stands, just I fuck and forget

I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
Yeah, this for the niggas with Benzes and the niggas without 'em
Scram, ho!

[Chorus: Andre 3000]
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

[Bridge: Future + André 3000]
These cars don't mean shit, these hoes don't mean shit
These clothes don't mean shit, these shows don't mean shit, whoaaaaa
(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola)
These cars don't mean shit, these hoes don't mean shit
These clothes don't mean shit, these shows don't mean shit, whoaaaaa
(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola)

[Verse 1: Future]
Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch, you better cut it, shawty, I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I just seen your flaw
Aye, tell that girl you 'bout to settle, whatchu tired of?
Aye, see how she react when you're no longer in your Beamer?
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio?
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from makin' mula
Oh, you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG
Can you love a thug, is all make believe
Pure fantasy, I see through it easily

[Chorus: André 3000]
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship

I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, 'cause if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up and if I were, why? Would you throw a party?
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction: these hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zippin' through the city and I don't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
'Cause if I buy one, they gon' sell ten, then what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk
'Til then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk
Eh?

[Chorus: André 3000]
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

[Verse 3: André 3000 + Future]
I told that girl, I told that girl tell the truth
Say she the realest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof
These girls be droppin' these lies, these girls be makin' shit up
She don't wanna stand in my line, she tryna come to the front
Yeah, she love her country but hate American cars
For the shape of them, he'll have you know all of them bitches is foreign
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good black pussy he keep ignorin'?
The world told him didn't shit rhyme with orange
The girl is only with him because he's tourin'
Well go on angel, I don't blame you, don't hang yo head
I know it's survival for you, get it like an IOU
She's so materialistic
I'm just enjoyin' life, I'm livin' life, you know?
That worldwide pussy, yeah, worldwide pussy, yeah
Pull up at this girl crib bumpin' Lil' Boosie, yeah

[Chorus: André 3000]
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch

[Outro: Future]
We drive these cars on the regular
This life that I live is incredible
We gon be fly whenever, we gettin' richer forever
Without these foreign vehicles, can we still gon' be together?
Tell me




 [Hook: Future]
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

[Verse 1: Future]
I took the profit from the coke and slapped it right on my feet
I tried to hide a half a million cash, it took me some weeks
Man, that bitch got some head so good, you gon' swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed the molly with the lean, now we laid up in a suite
I'm in the hood posted up, I know the police gon' sweep
I keep a hood ho, so I can keep that dough where she sleep
She down for a nigga and she ride with that four-fifth
I put that AK in her name, but I keep it on me
I'm brand new when I step out from my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos, trying their best to compete
I got a style so outrageous, I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets, all you niggas know me

[Hook]
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead

They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off


[Verse 2: Future]
I put Versace on my denim, I'm a lion at heart
I was selling dope like every day 'til I topped the charts
I serve my same clientele, cause these cars are unmarked
I'm running up to every car before the car even parks
We went from Reebok and Girbauds, now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be Future, I'll look at you just like you're my son
I got a rap check and all I hang around is ex-cons
And if I ever get in trouble, my bitch gon' pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yopper and she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice, cause it was already done
These niggas showing out for me, so now they ordering up ones
Been on some futuristic shit, now I'm back where I begun

[Hook]
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me

They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off


[Verse 3: Future]
Put the codeine in the Sprite, and then I'll have me a drank
Smelling like a pound of loud when I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp, in the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign, and I'm cool as you think
You need to turn it to the max if you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes

[Hook]
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

Too much makeup in the mirror, girl
You been at it all day
We done toured with em, we done talked to em, and they all gang

Expensive cannon in my Spanish pool, we got the same name
Gotta top me off in the Valet, suck it sideways
Her momma left her in the bando at a young age
She have thoughts of [?] group homes, she like to runaway
I know you hate to be told what to do cause you self-made

Too much money in the closet, girl I gotta switch safes
Take some tails on me to the flight, girl I gotta switch planes
I seen a triple homi', they was in the wrong place
I ain't giving up on you, but we gotta take a break
Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot, I'm on acid

 [Hook]
It ain't all about the ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed (yeah)
It ain't all about these hoes, I know how it feel to go broke (yeah)
It ain't all about the cars, I grind and I grind hard (yeah)
It ain't all about these clothes, my nigga dead God bless his soul (yeah)

[Verse 1: Future]
Ever since my grand daddy died (what), I ain't been da same nigga (nope)
And sickle cell (where) all inside my lil sister
I'm fucked up inside, put more lean inside my system
Every day I tell God I wish Snoop was still living
I ain't forgot about ya nigga, Free band gang winning
I do shit for Lonzo, a junkee stabbed my nigga
That could of been me serving, you don't know the half my nigga
The weight I'm dealing with, I just might start killing shit
I hit the studio vibing, spitting the realest shit
I shouldve seen a psychiatrist, I was built for this
On the road of riches ain't about a bitch
No DVS's, no wink & kiss, paid dues are overdue
This shit ain't bout my neck or wrist, real shit (true story)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
It ain't all about the glitter
And the gleam it ain't what it seem (yeah)
But I'm grinding like a blender
I'm a whip into I get that cream (yeah)
I keep it G who keep it G with me
I fuck with who gone fuck with me (yeah)
It ain't all about these bitches, death to you snitches
I'll die by these riches (yeah)

You niggas wanna be LO but you can never be LO
Cause you can never see LO (yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
Thousand dollar shots on my face, I'm coolin' it
I rock the gold, keeping it basic it ain't bout the gliss
I want the type of check I can make my niggas rich
Alot of people talk that loyalty don't know what it is
Have you ever been so broke you don't even wanna live?
So fucked up to the point that funerals can share the tears
Gotta grind so fucking hard the shit bring you to tears
Forgot to call my momma on her birthday God bless the kid
Phone barely ringing now it's ringing till it's dead
I'm bout to run dem m's up mutha fuck the feds
Got my money in a wall, ain't fucking up my bread
I had a talk with the Most High and this is what He said

[Hook]




 I'm stainless
Tempered by earth and flame
Mixed with time and pain
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
And the product I done came with
Not blameless for the straps and the dope that I hold
The sacks that I sold
Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges
The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with
Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens
See the clear path that I used to couldn't see
Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be
Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
My sweat and my tears dull pain
And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known
I was born to reign




 [Hook: Future]
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath

[Verse 1: Future]
They come out Charlie Sheen (winning)
They come out coupe machines
They shoulda came with wings
How they flying in
Man I'm on that lean
In the house with green
In the house with yay
Man we need a mask
All these dope fumes (don't sniff)
While we count this cash
Straight drop class
Put it in a freezer
Put it on a block, give them J's a teaser
They gave my dope a name
They call this dope diesel
You need some gambino
You be fly like a eagle
We move them bands like cheetah
Get you a egg beater
And a half a square
Whip you a brick fair

[Hook: Future]
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath


[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I mean some birds in the shower dawg
Pass me the bounty dawg
Quick picker upper
Look at this motherfucker
His rhyme is a paper plate
I chop 'em like paper steaks
My life is a marathon
Cause I'm on the paper chase
My dog caught a paper case
He had too much paper on him
He said it was routine
I said they was waiting on him
Them fed they just chase the sack
Them J they just taste the crack
These dumb niggas chasing hoes
And me I'm chasing racks
Cause we offer fifty sacs
Fuck up bout thirty racks
Go drop me twelve bars
And get that there right back
My aunty say what's that smell
She said it is smellin' sour
I find it hard to believe
I just got 'em out the shower

Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I just want the birds off
They cut all my phones off
They know how to clean them up
Got falcons and eagles nigga

Them birds come every day
Plus I see them everywhere
Just send me a stork nigga

[Hook]
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath

[Verse 1: Future]
I know your type

The very first night
Smashed out your lights, look and acting crazy
Caught in the hype
Come take this pipe, can't even take it
I'm fly as a kite
Wanna ride on this plane, bitch you lazy
Wake up every single morning with that dick on your breath
She ain't looking for love, she looking for help
I got money, make her wet
Gone and cut the check
Soon as you fuck her to sleep she dreaming 'bout a Rolex
You super fine, I know your kind
You'll blow a nigga mind, why the fuck you crying
I'm on my grind, committing these crimes
Ain't got no time, for that sobbing, and all that lying
You another nigga problem, I'm glad you ain't mine

[Chorus: Future]
These bitches ain't shit
She'll fuck your homeboy, she'll take your money
She'll take off running, where the fuck she going
These bitches ain't shit

She already fucked Rock

I'mma hit her in that throat, that throat
And she sucking on Drama
Telling me the nigga momma this must be karma
This must be life
When you hitting these bitches don't take off your ice
She must be tricking
She ain't picked up the phone, she gone on a mission
She watching Basketball Wives
Every single damn night, before she go to sleep
Thinking 'bout them trips with Kanye
While she sucking on Wiz Khalifa

[Chorus: Future]
These bitches ain't shit
She'll fuck your homeboy, she'll take your money
She'll take off running, where the fuck she going
These bitches ain't shit
You too dramatic, causing all that static

Let me roll this 'gar, I'mma fuck you in the car

What's in the dark, come to the light
You can't take this far
It's 4 a.m., when I'm leaving the bar, cause I'm a star
And I can't cuddle
We fucking on top of these covers, I gotta keep it gutta
And I'm on a double, and a half
And all you keep screaming 'bout is some cash, haaaa
And all I can do to myself is laugh, yeah
And all I'mma do to the bitch is pass, her fast
Cause she ain't got no stamina, say she trash
Excuse my manners, here go a bag

[Chorus: Future]
These bitches ain't shit
She'll fuck your homeboy, she'll take your money
She'll take off running, where the fuck she going

They gave lil Trotty 25 for them thangs, nigga

They walk up on you, give it to you, see your friends, nigga
(Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro)
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money.... all day
I heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money.... all day
Heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot

[Hook]
It got blood on that money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

[Verse 1]
28 grams, I serve it on the porch
I just seent them narcs, they ran off in my house
The homicide unit coming to the house
My cousin murked a nigga and he just got out
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up some drank, say "Fuck my problems"
My hood, they treat me like I'm El Chapo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I had the warrant in Clayco and beat the case
Man I'm fresh as hell, bitch, Easter day
All my ghetto tactics I'm above average
I've been so in tune, man I've been so ambitious
Grab another Fanta, let me fill it up
If they ain't make the channel, you ain't built like us
The Federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I feel I'm walkin' through Hell
I swear to God I'll never tell
They try to give a nigga the chair
I tell my mama, "Wish me well"

[Hook]
They got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
They got girl on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it

I know the devil is real, I know the devil is real
I take a dose of them pills and I get real low in the field
I'll fly to LA today, and I live so high in the Hills
I share the mansion with goonies, I shared the bitch with a goonie
I took the mack in Bal Harbor, niggas ain't slippin', we got 'em
I took the pack out to Paris, me and that money got married
Me and the molly got married
Devoted in everything, my niggas mean everything
We're 5 deep inside a Chevy
Yeah we tryna get it
Ask me do I know how to whip it
Fuck the witness

[Hook]
It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

[Verse 3]
She put me off and it was ugly
I made a million dollars, say she love me
The way she did me, it destroyed me
I kept it real with lil' shorty
I've been goin' bar for bar, these niggas know what's poppin' with me
I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet
I'm prolly in the mood to fuck your bitch on the beach
I dropped out of school and I get money like Meech
Send a junkie, send a driver just to get somethin' to eat
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine

[Hook]
It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

[Outro]
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up a drink, say "Fuck my problems"
The federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot
Heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood
They got girls on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it

Salute, DJ Cutthroat big homie

[Hook: Future]
Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugs

[Verse 1]
I'm crumbling herb , I stuff me a swisher
I light up the tree, every day round here it be Christmas
I'm clouding my thoughts, my words comin' out doper
And I'm always high, that's what I got locs for
I'm on a real strong pack, that California OG
I'm smoking blunt after blunt , like snoop D-O double G
It's hard to keep it low key , when you smell like a whole P
I wake up every single morning, twisting up me some green

[Hook: Future]
Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugs

[Verse 2]
I sip codeine , Oxycontin, xanax, xanax
Come fly with me (Michael Jordan) can you handle it, handle it?
On two of em, I can't even talk
That's Pluto, That's Pluto
Have you ever been to Molly world?
If you Ain't been there, Suggest you don't go

[Hook: Future]
Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugs




 [Verse 1: Future]
Break a brick down to deuces
Break a deuce down to dime
Let them bird take a bath
Yeah you get you some shine
I just got me a turbo Porsche
And brought me some diamonds
I can talk that narcotic talk cause I live it ain't lying
Had to step up my hustle, stack that paper for months
I came back from the coop, I'm in the trap in the booth
I hit the button on da roof, it transform right in the trunk
I'm a superstar and a hustler, I do what I want
Catch me working off my cell phone, and I got that iPad
And I'm doing crazy number you can call me Comcast
Drinkin on that dirty mud and I'm on that good gas
You can't come to Carolina, you ain't got ya hood pass

[Hook]x2
Break a brick down to deuces

They come in clean, but they going out dirty
I'm talking selling a zip, that's a whole quarter birdie
We jack and we servin', acting nervous we take it

Broke niggas hard me because I be fuckin they ladies
KMG gettin money and we blowin on Lakers

[Hook]x2

[Verse 1]
Cookin' dope, breakin' rules, whip it back, make her choose
Flippin' packs of Peru, can't push that, that's a juug
Sellin' dope at the school just to go get the Jordans
Gotta go get the socks, comin' up off of rocks
Never talk back to cops, comin' up with scenarios
A dope sale opens plenty doors, fish scale with the odor
I'm servin' that Lamar Odom, fuck bitches look like Kardashian
This the type of shit I be on, sellin' ki's off any phone
Pickin' up on the ringer, diamonds all on my finger
Got a half a ticket in singles, tippin' stacks on the stripper pole
Drankin' codeine, nigga pourin' 4's, ballin' hard, nigga, Derrick Rose

They can't compare you, Future, now you buy 'em out of tools
You got your barrel Future, promise me you'll never snooze
400 racks in a Nike box, no shoes
A hundred racks inside my pocket, I'm tryna spend it now
A half a ticket in the parkin' lot, I'm in it now
A bunch of dead faces, then we put 'em in the ground
Pour up the medication in the Sprite and stir it 'round
Aye fuck my registration, I'm in them paper tags now
I'm crazier than a mental patient, fillin' up that stash now
Can't think about my past now, all I'm thinkin' is cash now
Hit 'em up and stick 'em up and takin' off my mask now

[Hook]

Sexual chemistry, we don't show no sympathy
I want you spiritually, but I need you more mentally

Took a pledge, took my team, I'mma die about it
Balmains, depends which ones, they cost a whole thousand
Really think that she the one? Don't bring that ho around me
When you see her out in public, she so shy-shy
When you get her in the bed, she bring that freak out
Custom made every piece, she call me papa
She gave me real nasty mouth, Lady Gaga
She got a real nasty mouth, I won't apologize

Because I can't make this up

[Verse 1]
When you getting money they say you joined the illuminati
Only time they talkin', when you getting money
When you run the city bad bitches come runnin'
Now they get to be in ya presence, they coming
I can fuck a bad bitch poor bitch real split
I was commin' over old head like slick rick
Nothin rapper, this some OG kurkwood shit
(whatcha got on your plate future?) Fish and Grits!
Take a pic Snap a flick kiss my kicks they pay attention
Must they finally realize you in the murkin mix
You gone pull in line or we gone spit that venom
I'm thinkin 10 steps ahead I want my own denim
We were goin in them stackin every penny
Stretching every nickel over the same strippers
I gave it to you straight up, right down the center
We don't like rappin this car is foreign right down the center

[Hook]
I'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)

Do it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)

Turn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)
Bought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)

[Verse 2]
I get this big without tryin
I'm matchin' by mistake I want that yacht I'm on my grind
I learn from my mistakes
You want it daddy go and get it
Don't never hesitate
I'm burnin hotter than some lava and I ain't takin off a day
They on my trail, like they tryin' to build a case
These rappers worser than them few
They watch you spendin' cake
They want ya style
And they often imitate
I set the trend
And I watch them duplicate it
I'm satisfied with none of this money I'm getting hungry
I'm breakin' bread with a team young nigga we hit Columbia
Salute the troops we in them coupes like caprices
Old school player ridin' in a foreign feature
Change em up like rentals yeah we change em up like rentals
Ridin' like the president.. I'm presidential
Blowin' green like ya thought I would
It's simple
I'm coming straight up out my temple

[Hook]
I'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)

[Verse 3]
Do You take the cash to be yo lawfully wedded wife
And Honor this bih for the rest of yo life
Yes I do till death do us part
365 yay they go hard
And we go home
Crib so big look like the Georgia dome
I'm rollin like a rollin stone, they do nothin
I pick the streets where I belong
What time were we supposed to be
Maybe its the dro in me
My girl got a girlfriend
Look like she come from overseas
Ain't nothing like these other niggas
I took the chicken out the bill with her
Shit I done still in her its still in em
Who introduced you, to jimmy and tory
Change the color of the bottom of your shoe ya walkin foreign
Gotcha nigga vip
That's very important
I done freestyled
More than you lil niggas recorded

I’ll shoot a nigga and some ceelo

And I can't lie and stroke my ego
And they done got me back in beast mode
I got some shooters and they ain’t seen though
I’m out the country in Montego
And these bitches don’t speak no englo
All they wanna know is the lingo

[Verse 1: Future]
In the matrix all like i’m neo
I make movies like Al Pacino
I can wrap a bale like burritos
I go hella hard for them c-notes
They ain’t never seen what we did, nigga
You can’t get fingerprints off these triggers
I’m a guapaholic, i’m money-drunk
Death-defying, i’m livin’ like avatar
I done went to another planet
See my pockets they on gigantic
I take off like a rocket in Paris
I fuck bitches that don’t mind sharin’

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Wale]
They say wale dope
They gon’ say what they say, never to my face, no
And i’m runnin’ out of space to put all of my favorite clothes
Took a nigga’s favorite shoes - took a nigga’s favorite store
I call the folk that made ‘em, foreign
These ladies trippin’ …
‘cause I buck a lot but I don’t be datin’ none of ‘em
And I roll with niggas, go-to niggas, know they ain’t as friendly
And all my pieces wide receivers they all eighty’ somethin’
Wale, though…
And I make your ladies do my say-so
I’m just a nigga on the grind tryna make moves
Shine like a g, though
Rhyme bully, my mob goodie, shout-out to ceelo

I grew up on them grounds with the dealers and hounds
We bought up more bottles
And fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat

I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went to St. Tropezin' like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, niggas straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson; put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' off of me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another 60 thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick and got my brain washed
And for the shit that got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil lil liquor out, pour a lil malt liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

[Verse 3]
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin’ harder than the Pacers
I been tryin’ to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I’m making U.S.D's overseas
That’s U.S. dollars that you can’t achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "Nigga please"
Playin’ poker now we’re back at Strokers
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin’
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin’ myself that I’m still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles
These niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint
Like I'm Kid Cudi probably
I fuck around and faint, I'ma fall on a drink
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' molly
Married to this motherfuckin’ money

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 4]
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some mo'
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might go after Madonna, I get the crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'llac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partna
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don’t you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge 2]
Pour that bubbly, drink that muddy, drink that muddy
When we're cuddling, yeah I'm covered in
I was dug in it, I was just loving it
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
They ain't for you dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you shorty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely

We trap out this bitch 'til the police raid it
I seen that coco turn bad when it get in the pot
I'm sorta like a chef when I'm over the pot

I got the truth in me, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I take (still comin')
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't never answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(so familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss

Down, like a nigga, she lie
Kindness, she lie
Kindness, oh

It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The times I get frustrated, I don't take one
I feel a hit comin', so I went and made one, oh yeah
They know my type of speed, they can't get no zs on me
They know they gotta be, I'm the shit, can't fall asleep on me
Dom Pérignon, shake it up and spray it
We ain't nothin' but some champs and thoroughbreds
This cash flowin' 'till infinity
I been buyin' out the stores, living luxury
I can't forget about the swag champ, OGD
It ain't no competition, I got my mission secured
I gotta make 'em feel it, all the pain I endured

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong

Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
Ain't stopped by the rendered red lights in the Range coupe
I might shoot off in a Benz, and a Lamb too
I sent a few niggas frowning when I came through
Jealousy and greed, that's what it done came to
I got my proceeds, must've been an angel
I got a Cuban kilo on my fingers
I trapped my whole hood out, turned myself to a star
I'm on point now like I still duck from the law
They gettin' mad at us 'cause my niggas won't fall off
My niggas Cash keep the Actavis with him by the bar
I know they see me out in Aspen, they said it was luck
Be honest to me

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness

We in the race car whips, that’s my genetics
I made my money through flipping, and I don’t sweat it
I’m ‘bout to spend me some chips, I won’t regret it
I put in weight from the deck, I’m driving reckless
You can’t be hacking the player, you get a penalty (that’s a no)
I get to dozing off in the coupe off promethazine
You put a turbo next to a turbo, that’s royalty
Represent loyalty

Fuck around, I had to call up Scratch

Lean in my liver, I've been taking good batch
Real dope dudes don't hang around rats
Four by four, sitting taller than a 'Lac
Margiela on my toes, sittin' way in the back
Canary yellow gold, Rollie and a Mac
Glock four-oh, plastic gat
VV coated, sitting on my chest
Pussy ass niggas don't call no threat
I'm a big dog, you ain't nothin' but a pet
Weak ass nigga boutta run outta check

You better not tell them none what you saw
Soon as I drop, I got flexed up
Fuck all that drama, got the heat tuck
Ice out the hittas, my cuts up
Yellow gold Presi, it bust up
Young nigga already pushed the Ferrari
I came in with the head off
Jumbo Patek gon' crush your career
All these wheels, got dust on the wheel
So many foreigns, a car dealership
Poured up my cup when I hopped on the Lear
Drippin' severe, the God is here
Dic's in here, I got chartered here

I got that monkey on my back
I walk around with 500 racks

[Post Chorus: Detail & Future]
You know I'm out here getting it baby
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Money coming stu-stupid fast
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Getting money and I count it all
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ohhh fuck my life up
(It's true)

[Verse 2: Future]
Eight stacks sitting in the club
Swipe my credit card, fuck my life up
These drugs gave me my light up
Told her "Baby please, don't bite it"
I ain't had sex in a whole week
Just so you can get to know me
Gushy, gush, so soaky
I put it in, go so deep
Motherfuck how far you
Come over here and get the write up
Homeowners' association, they always tryna get right up
You got a better advantage
You always use xannies whenever you plan it
Pussy be fucking my life up, and yet at the same time its giving me stamina
My role model fucked my life up
Two bitches in the same room, no light on
So easy getting 100 thousand when the night up
Got cake cookin' up cake bake
My life fucked for a ladies bit
83 to 88, money comes so fast

[Hook: Future]
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
Girls it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true

[Post Chorus: Detail & Future]
Know I'm out here getting it baby
Why you tryna to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Money coming stu-stupid fast
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Getting money, then I count it all
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ohhh fuck my life up, ohhhh
Fuck my life up




 [Half Hook: Future]
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I cook me one I cook up a half a key
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I buy a car I trick it out with the fee

[Verse 1: Future]
You should've left me inna blind
You should've left me Ray Charles
You shouldn't've never let me get on the track with the Drum Squad
You shouldn't've never let me hit the sack, I'm fucking your broad
You shouldn't've never let me hit the studio with the bar
You shouldn't've never let me do it, you know I grind hard
You shouldn't've never let me whip it, turn myself to a star
You shouldn't've never let me struggle, You should never did it
You shouldn't've never ever show me how to remix the fishes
You should've never fucked me over, no you should've never done it
I'mma send them Puerto Ricans through your way and show you who run it
You shouldn't've never let my buy the Benz and get it fully loaded
You shouldn't've never let my dig a whole and then let me owe it
I'mma forge out my wrist
I'mma ice out my chain
After I leave the dealership I'mma go see Johnny Dang
I might just whip me a kilo
Then go flex mi amigo
I'mma wrap a whole bail up like a taco burrito

[Full Hook: Future]
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I cook me one I cook up a half a key
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I buy a car I trick it out with the fee
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Cause when I made a mil' I made another one instantly
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
I got foreign bitches on my line and bitches right next to me

[Verse 2: Drumma Boy]
Send a gift to my Gods, for blessing my recipe
Turn that soft to that hard, like a dick to Penelope
I'mma king of this game, overruling the mini-me
Can show you the recipe, still can't produce the melody
A magical mentally turn 3 minutes to 30g
The work of Achilles, breakdown the sound of the synergy
My prago so yayo like I went down to South Italy
I rally through ATL, then shoot it through Tennessee
I cook it myself, no middleman or the in-between
I fall from a strange river and stroke through the industry
Im so turnt up, can't comprehend what they tellin' me
You once was the plug but now don't need what you sellin' me

[Full Hook: Future]
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I cook me one I cook up a half a key
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe

You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Cause when I made a mil I made another one instantly
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
I got foreign bitches on my line and bitches right next to me

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
I got a house full of Jacksons like my name Tito
Threw more bones than Tebow, caught more bones than T.O
Word on the street that boy Dolph got that recipe
That's why jump flights and greet my plug frequently
2 hoes on my iPhone say they wanna come go to sleep with me
I saw my first hundred thou' and it did something to me mentally
Smokes that come from Compton, my sneakers come from Italy
I'm that same nigga from Castalia remember me ?
Shouldn't've shown me the game cause now it ain't no looking back
I'm in the last spin lap
My boy Drumma he cooking crack
Call my socket
Got a sack
Spent a quarter thing of sacks
Cop a drop and park it in the hood and make that right back

[Full Hook: Future]
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I cook me one I cook up a half a key
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe

 [spoken intro]

[Hook]
I put spikes around my jacket and I'm strapped up with the ratchet
I'm chasin' after paper, I became a savage
My nigga set my nigga up, the game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside the Escalade and crash it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean

[Verse 1]
Leather jackets, no motorcycle
I'm spiked up like a bad drink
9 to 3, that good supreme
With all the stress to blow a gas tank
I work hard and it came out
I turnt up and turnt ya bitch out
Then I went from dead broke to layin' up in a penthouse
There are no secrets when you leakin'
I woke up this evenin'
And I seen a demon
I'm on that pure codeine and
Tryna clear my thoughts
Niggas mourn for my pain
All they see is fame and what it bring
I paid dues, graduated from finesse school
I showed and proved, I never lose
I'm too smart, I should've went to Harvard
Drinking out the bottle, holdin' my revolver

[Hook]
I put spikes around my jacket and I'm strapped up with the ratchet

My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean

[Verse 2]
Takin' three drugs at one time, duckin' one time
Can you niggas stop hating on Future for one time?
I commit a million crimes
That ain't enough for you
I'mma sell a million rhymes
All that shit I been through
I was grindin' hard
Niggas tried to hold me back
They ain't wanna see me with the plug
They ain't wanna see with the sack
I got it
It worked out
I kept loyal
I set standards
Now I'm royal
Niggas tried to take some paper
Now he gotta take his life
Till we get the screaming
I can't sleep right
Niggas'll put a hit on your head
Now you walkin' around with a price
Nigga ain't make it to see it
Im gon' be alright

[Hook]
I put spikes around my jacket and I'm strapped up with the ratchet

I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
We do five star suites for no reason
Money, cars, clothes, these hoes for no reason
Yea let the endo burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

[Chorus]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?

[Verse 1]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want 'em
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

[Pre-Chorus]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

[Chorus]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, do you love me?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know you broken hearted, [?] nothing hurt me

Get up on, get up on they lookin' out for you
Get up on, get up on they lookin' out for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect

 [Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time "that drink will kill you"

[Verse 1]
One, Two cups keep my ice cool
Three or four zips have me leaning like a fool
Purple Sprite on top of ice
I'm rocking ice on dirty sprite
I feel real nice to be precise my jewelry on, high as a kite
I'm space cadet
I drink a check
I spit a Check
Got much respect for Pimp C bitch
Hold my bitch, my bitch say 'why I'm on purple shit'
My purple stuff stay in my cup
Got drank on me I pour me up
Texas oil got me spoiled
Red and Yellow I'm leaning hard

[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"

[Verse 2]
I wake up leaning from last night
I drink my lean for breakfast
I'm on that Waffle House cup
RIP to Chad Butler
I got my favorite drink with me it taste just like some kool-aid
Pour me up a 3 or 4 gone have me leaning side ways
Well listen cold with screw up kit we be leaning always
Drinking all day, drinking tall cups I don't give a fuck
Im trued up With two cups
They shook up with dirty sprite
Promethazine can't get enough
Till I O.D you know whats up

[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4

My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"

[Verse 3]
I'm moving slow the lights ain't bright as they supposed to be
My eyes heavy see what happens when you fuck with me
I think I lost my heartbeat for a second and a half
I'm on that Easter pink-flavored Sprite dirty flag
My ice in my cup filled up to the brim
Drink university even the teacher was a pimp
Church tabernacle drinking coffee like a pastor
Two cups filled with lean, we some dirty sprite bastards

[Hook]
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"

I'm a stone cold guerrilla, it’s in my DNA

Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - It’s in my DNA
I'm stackin' paper every day, it’s in my DNA
Aye, aye - it’s in my DNA
I just pour me up a Ace, it’s in my DNA

[Verse 1]
I feel like Tarzan and King Kong, LV on my three phones
Them iphones, that 5G, that 4G, I'm too G, I'm too street
I'm 3D, I'm HD, these movies that I make
Can’t see me, you capische
I’m a titan, I fly in, like a pelican
You irrelevant, to a president, on medicine
It’s that kilo, you fuck dingy hoes, el chapo
Young future fuckin’ on pocket holes
We re-up then reload, I blow up, then explode
I'm organized like a crime boss, I'm up there like a mafia
That's a fresh new Balenciaga, all dreaded up like a Rasta
Got a million soldiers on my roster
No chains on and I’m aqua, fina, water
I slaughter your daughters, I’m known in Bal Harbour

I’m sucker-free dog, pass me my sprite
I’m an ATLien and they say I’m way way out of sight
Aye that baby bottle syrup, man that shit keep me on point
I was servin’ furl, tryna make my rent first of the month
And I got your girl, and I filled her mouth with a lot of cum
I’m rollin’ big blunts, gotta keep some ganja down my lungs
Hard times, turned me to a maniac
My blood line - motion pictures cinematic
Mix it up - mix it up, mix it up
Pour it up - pour it up, pour it up
Styrofoam, cellphone, bakin’ soda
I'm screwed up: Lil' Flip, game over

Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, haann
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies, Ahhhh

[FUTURE]

More money more problems, man this shits hilarious
I got baby mama drama, this shit embarrassing
Once you get the fame, it’s consequences that come with it
Sometimes you wanna wake up and just say I’m done with it
You know all these dudes I paid
Now you do the most complaining
Now I made it and I’m famous
Emotionally you drain me
I smoke a pound of that kush
And blow out the stress I’m thinking
I put versace on leather cover me like a blanket
I sip on codeine, I’m sippin it till my body numb
And I get loaded like baby gangster vl shawty
Remember shoppin at linnicks, I let you hold the 40
I’m a superstar and now you wish you can take it from me

[Hook]
When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh

[French Montana]

Getting high, drinking, smoking, rolling up the purple
And I swear to god it'll hurt me more to hurt you
Grinding, hustling we ain't never take no nights off
Money came flipping, switching, tryna cut my lights off
Fight and make up, shoes, 1000 on the make-up
Pouring drank, to hold me down like an ankle
Tunnel vision on that money, fuck that talk
In the club, twisting fingers, getting twisted
Off that dark, water
We was down and out, we had to plan it out
Me and shawty getting ghost, spoil the phantom out
Quarter million on the car, silk medusa sheets
Before I made a dollar, I was lying to the streets

[Hook]
When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh

You ain't never ever get your bitch back

[Verse 1]
Lamborghini doors when I lift off
They done fucked around, got a nigga pissed off
Nice little thot got a stiff arm
Did the Heisman on the hoe got the stiff arm
Fuck all that biting like Tyson or Holyfield
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
A couple of pills and I got my soda filled
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Break out a sweat, I go head over heels for these mils
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa
She thinks she the one but to me she ain't nothing but a thrill
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I've been drippin' like a God, what else?
I been dodgin' all the flage, what else?
I been fillin' up garages, what else?
I gave her her first ménage, what else?
Close your eyes eyes eyes
I'm about to slide slide slide
Wonder why why why
I stay in the sky sky sky
Pink molly, let me dance with her (yup)
Freestylin', let me dance with her
Sky Dweller, it was sentimental
Rose gold, it was cinnamon

[Verse 2]
Fuck up my bitch by the change
Want me to jump out the stage
I wanna jump in the air
You know the love ain’t fair
You killin' then show us the proof
I already got the juice
Chain different colors like fruits
I like to hang out the roof
I got to train my bitches
I'm putting chains on my bitches
I'll pull some chain on the snitches
I'm focused, I'm back on my mission
Flex on a nigga, no apologies
Molly off-white, done got to me
Playing hockey with the ice in the Major League
35 bitches at the St. Reg
Fall back shooter like KD
Back in the kitchen with Curry
Pullin' up wit Xan, can't hurt me
Pineapple drink lookin' syrupy
56 nights, I was dirty
Styrofoam cups servin' patients
Heard you been talkin' bout the kid
Knowin' damn well that’s a flagrant (technical)
I cancel two bitches
I got me some new bitches
Come check out how I’m living
I got me some new drippy

She ain't got nothing to do with it
I'll give my bitch to you
If that what she mean to you

[Chorus]

Misbehaving with ya freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the six
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born

Lil mama fell in love with the lifestyle
Four bad bitches on a white couch

Told her hol' up, let me put the pipe down
Touchdown, I ain't even ate yet
Serve it on a platter in a red dress
Chinchilla, turn that bitch to Mona Lisa
All she want to do is fuckin' hit the beach
Sand from her toes out the Lambo
Hit Turk Caicos for your sandals
30 round clip for the wrong day
Drivin' in the whip, up the wrong way

And most of these fake niggas they done fell off
I'm raising the stakes nigga and I'm well off
I'm counting that cake trimming my nail off
And when times was hard I move a bail off
And when I'm whipping them lanes I'm in that new spurr
All you niggas some lames softer than new fur
Congratulations to niggas like me dawg
Get money get money and I don't see y'all

Give your life for this gang gang shit

I dread, I prevent it cause man I'm a menace
I know what I did, I'ma finish this
I got the code, I got the remedy
I'm doin' this for infinity
I ain't lookin' for no sympathy
Put a dollar sign on my enemies
You can't come between my embassy
You gotta stay off the premises

It's gon' hurt my soul just to reminisce
Gotta understand what I represent
You know what I mean to the game

Picked the dogs up like an infant
Got 13 bodies (what else?)

Burned the eyes out a witness (what else?)
Put your hood on chitlins (what else?)
Cartiers, I got privilege
See the way my dawgs livin'
They always gotta dodge prison
I was born dodgin' penitentiary
I bought my mom French Tiffanys
Gang, gang, we a family
Hold it down for the family
You goin' viral for the family
The homie tried to plead insanity
Pray to God, take this energy
Turn around the positivity
When you servin' for an activity
Better learn about the history
I was touchin' work in elementary
Started cookin' work and skippin' chemistry
Then I started speakin' poetry
I just wish my dawg didn't ignore me

[Chorus]
Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
I got local ho, but I shipped her out the country though
Ain't no giving up, you already know how I give it up
Sippin' out the coffee cup, my Presidential face a hockey puck
Feed me dope, I get wavy like a boat
Feed me dope, and I start seeing ghosts
I'm off the porch, I'm skippin' court
Skip to my lou, trapping a sport (skip to my lou)
Ok fish butter, chicken cutter (okay)
Maserati, we get mozzarella, (okay) ayy
Go'n, you doin' that wrong (out of here), Al Capone
Don't talk on phones but we get dope money all night long

Coco, watch me hit her with a big stop
Toto, keep the receipt, I'm a bad boy
Thirty round drip, ooh, he a mad boy
All of my diamonds clear, ooh, that's a jag boy
I see Hermes spelt out all on my tag boy
I was hustlin' in the field with all I had boy (whoa whoa)
My mama shed a few tears but I wasn't sad boy (whoa whoa)
Tryna explain to her for years she had a cash boy (whoa whoa)
I took a pill and a half today, that ain't my last boy (whoa)
The one with the beans on it, I'm taking off like Elroy
I took a few to my head, I got the B on the hedge
I'm living close to the edge, I gotta stay with some lead
I wanna hit me a lick, just like a sheep on the bed

[Chorus]
Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
I got local ho, but I shipped her out the country though
Ain't no giving up, you already know how I give it up
Sippin' out the coffee cup, my presidential face a hockey puck
I get wavy like a boat
Feed me dope, and I start seeing ghosts
I'm off the porch, I'm skippin' court
Skip to my lou, trapping a sport (skip to my lou)

Order up the Lamborghini, put me on the list
All the fettuccine, I can clone a bad bitch
Take her out of Bakers, now she shop at Jeffrey's
I'm on a roll, getting money, got a bad recession
What type of nigga you know in the middle of the hood worth some tickets?
What type of nigga you know sell out shows play with fishes?
Gucci, Louie, Prada, that's the way a nigga kick it
I got a whole bird on me, nothing to be specific
Ice, ice, ice like I jumped in the Pacific water
Money, money, money and that shit coming in digits
I got 50 cent on me on my way to Walt Disney
That's a whole 50 racks, young nigga with the business

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Pusha T]
I got that fettuccine on me, tell me what you see
You can't be in Aldo standing next to me
Out them bitches pronto, out that R&B
Hit Paris for that poncho, the G's sound like Z's
Givenchy, Veuve Clicq, menage a trois, c'est la vie
I sell it all, he mail it all
Slow gift wrap, need a Christmas card
Champagne pour, I christen y'all
You niggas hating
I'm lifting off in private jets
We peeling out
In them Porsche Panameras that we wheeling out

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
I look a bitch in her ass 'fore I look a bitch in her eye
I see the bitch in y'all swag, I give a fuck if y'all fly
I'm cheap though, I'm staying paid, I'mma make it rain
And I'mma take the train, I'm Latino, got razor blades
Okay chico but it ain't to shave, I got pesos, I got pesos
Bad hoes by the caseload and she gonna get a face full
And she gonna get a face full so pardon if the kid narcissistic
I'm shining bright, it'd be hard to miss it, I heard y'all in Target
Thrifting while I'm buying out the whole Garment District
No room in the whole room, don't clean clothes
I hit show room, she's anorexic, no food
So it's half the check up in Noble, I got bad habits and good habits
Cheat a lot cause I'm good at it, fuck a bitch for her bank account
When I'm done with it, the whole hood have it

[Hook]

Trapped out, I'm on CNN, spaceship I done went to Mars
Gotta model bitch who can take the dick, got a gutter bitch who can take a charge
Went to Paris on a weekday, and I'm coming back in a couple months
Everyday I wake up, I'm drinking lean, I'm smoking blunts
Dropped out of my high school, then I went and copped me a drop top
Got residue on my dreadlocks, my whole style unorthodox
Trading in my hand scale, started selling them big bells
30 bricks by 30 bricks, I could sell a nigga some oatmeal
Sell a nigga some horse feed, cashing out for a hundred pounds
Sell a nigga some A-1, I'll cook it up for you right now

Fuck with me, my lick game, I'm hitting licks excite me
I'm taking off like MJ, my check game like Nike
Anytime I get that cash, that cash make me hyphy
I'm jumping off my products, stacking up my dollars
I stay chasing that guala, ain't no turning up my collar
Represent my city, nigga want game gotta pay pesos
That pink inside my Styrofoam, got yellow bones on my iPhone
Running up like a treadmill, conversation gotta pay bills
Everything I wear nigga is Ferragamo in public
High top Margiela's, thousand dollars for a sweater
Money talk no pressure, everything disrespectful

[Hook]
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'

Make sure the fish A-1, Make sure this fish
You gotta have that clean when you remix

Dope is out of here, I got that Earl Manigault jumping out the gym

Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballin'

My trainers are matching my jacket
I’m strapped with that ratchet
I’m strapped with that Bape and that ape
I’m gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals
Maybe one day I'ma get out the drank
And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don’t watch TV, we count Fettuccine
4 and a half, it’s right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon’ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a biznite
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, I’ma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ain't gon' make you a pile

Light skinned bone the same color macaroni
Put her hair in a pony, hit a note like Toni
I know you hoes been lonely, now I’m back on my lonely
And I'm back how you want it, and I'm back and I want it
Made a film like Sony, fuck the fake and the phony

And my life is like Belly, young Future, sincerely

Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands

My name could be Future Simmons
I'm most requested in clubs
I'm making girls fall in love
I'm poppin' bottles of bub
If I make it rain it's gon' flood
If I make it rain it's gon' thunder
I'm balling like Oklahoma
I'm chasing after them commas
You got Benjamins, then I want 'em
You got Franklins, then I need 'em
That [?] girl is a diva
I might just have to freeze her
She gon' pledge her allegiance
To Freeband Gang she believe in
Making movies like Steven
A foreign bitch from New Zealand
Her friend don’t even speak English!

Then I put it back in the bandage
I'm Super Future, I'm jammin'
The roof is panoramic
The coupe got brain damage
I'm a Freeband Gang bandit
I'm gnarly, and I'm wavy
Salute me, I'm going crazy
I get blowed until I'm faded
I trap until they raid it
I hustle – I ain't made it
I'm scorching, on fire, blazing
Black girls and Caucasians
Dominicans and Asians
You wish you were this fresh
You see how I'm dressed
Got a foreign bitch on deck
She know I got that check

We got that freeband money and we got that long paper tossing up yo baby mama with no conversation

Freeband gang
(The coolest DJ in the world)

[Verse 1]
Stress all in a nigga shoulders, feel it in my backbone
Trials and tribulations taking the pain with an advil
Rich gang la familia, last night was mad real
Texts in my phone playing jealousy and hatred, misery loves company
But I'm going on vacation, put the herb on rotation, you bite the hand that feed you
You can take a nigga heart but you can't the mind
I got the braincells of a billionaire, I wake up and fly anywhere, fly nigga anywhere
It's Klein-Davis, I'm fucking up club sofas
With my [?] bustin roaches with ashes on ashes
Spaceships and stars, I see snakes in the yard but I can deal with 'em
These bitches eat pussy better than me, I choke her while I fuck her, can't nobody do it like me
(Yeah she know dat)
Callin' this hoe my girl had to be on Molly and E
What the fuck I was on man? I'm tripping off that good codeine and kush
Fuckin' up [?] Imma' keep it on pushing cause it ain't fuckin' up my limits
Turn my weakness into strength, now forever scripting
Let a hoe ride first class put your shit in the bentley, man what's goin' on?
Put my codeine on swishers
Fuck it I love it, I taste it
It's so strange, but it make the pain go away, (DJ ESCO), it make the pain go away
When you frustrated cause you been a good nigga, when you was a crook nigga tryna' play it by the book nigga
And got played by a crook, nigga, it ain't easy at it look nigga
But God got his eyes on me
Like Whitney on the track
I will always love you for having me recognize the reality of karma
Future Hendrix

Escomoe City




 [Intro]
Call me when you leave
Ostentação, palavra que eu gosto de ouvir
Sand touch your toes when you cookin' breakfast
Pacific Ocean out the backyard lookin' sexy
Straight shot, codeine, no chase
Don't let your dreams go to waste

[Chorus]
I'ma need fresh air
What I need? Fresh air (what I need, what I need)
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need

[Verse 1]
Move on
Opportunities come once a lifetime
Without you
Never broke, play yaself, don't forget I had that
Come on
Feelin' like Janet Jackson said, it's all for you
Never try to put another girl, she ain't what I'm lookin' for, no

[Refrain]
I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
I'll be right back
Bad, bad, but she lookin' badder every week

[Verse 2]
On some shit to make you mine
Tell me where the safety at
Tell me where the security at
Movin' up to bigger paper bag
Tell me, tell me, is it impossible
To do these drugs and fall in love?

[Chorus]
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need

[Verse 3]
Ohhh
Sand touch your toes while you cookin' breakfast
Pacific Ocean out your backyard, lookin' sexy
Straight shot, codeine, no chase (no chase)
Don't let y'all dreams go to waste

I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
I'll be right back
Bad, bad, but she lookin' badder every week

[Chorus]

Tell me why suffocate
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
We, we, we, we

[Verse 4]
I'm mad, I'm mad, you know that I'm mad
Tipped up the scale, now pullin' off to Dubai
I'm mad, I'm mad, you know that I'm mad
Where is the love tonight? Where is the drugs tonight?
I need that shit right away
I just need fresh air right away
I just need fresh air right away
All I need is fresh air

[Chorus]
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need
Girl, I need
I'ma need
Girl, I need
I'ma need

[Outro]
I need that shit right away
I just need fresh air right away
I just need fresh air right away
I'ma need fresh air

It's been too long

I got your son sitting on a brick
My teacher said I wouldn't be shit
She even know what I represent
Free Band Gang President
Money over everything, nigga
Everything else irrelevant

[Bridge]
Lil' Mexico turf a gang land
I'm ABK like I'm Zonaman
That's Any Body Killa nigga
Do you have the heart to kill a nigga?
100 thousand for a lawyer, gotta be a Johnnie Cochran
Take the dope off the border, from the water, put it in the water

My paint wet, my neck wet, my ears wet, my wrist wet
Rings wet, my bitch wet, her bitch wet, they stay wet
Anytime I miss her, I’ma call her, she stay with it

You put in your own work, you reap all your benefits
You grind til’ you shed a tear, like, why I get put in for
I done it, lost it all, I had no one to call
We living on couches, these niggas ain’t 'bout shit
Take a straight shot to the head, face first sippin' ain’t scared
But it’s time to break bread, she asked how much I need
I’m ‘bout to fuck the hood out this bitch ad roll me some weed
I can’t see it like I want to, but she’s always there for me
It’s been hate the days in the streets and I have nobody
When I'm stressing, I hit her up and then we talk ‘bout it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
OG, Granddaddy, blowing like a chimney
Last night I passed out mixed for a women
Can’t keep it real with niggas, you got to handle business
You can’t see what I go through cuz it’s covered with all my image
And I love this life, and I won’t trade it for the world
And these niggas fake, that’s why you got to fuck their girls
Get high as kites, and we taking shot’s of syrup
I can’t see myself, if I was looking in the mirror
I don’t understand the haters and I will never understand it
These niggas rather see you fall, than see you standin’
These niggas they'll leave you for dead while you breathin'
I feel like she love me, unconditionally, know I can see it

[Hook]

She do me plenty favors, you always on your worst behavior
She callin' me just to save her, I'm far from ordinary so I cater
Million dollar [?], I know she can get it certain
Give her diamonds and pearls, I know her sex as good as her curse
Girl I rarely brag on love, I rarely ever get hurt
You all under my arm while I'm all under your skirt
Girl your angel wings so controllable
Girl your essence is so damn adorable
Girl be patient, watch it happen, it is what it is
You always wake first, give what you give

Good mornin', girl you're off the market
We done painted a portrait, we lookin' back at our fortune
We are love, we are love, are love
Ain't neither one of us perfect, we just scratchin' the surface
You would think we did it on purpose, I don't know if it's virtuous
I don't know if it hurts you, everything is worth it

20 cars in my new garage
Got em laying out like a club night
My Oakland homie told I'm "hella tight"
My hippie homie told me take a flight
Future need to go and take the acid
Future need to go and take the shrooms
Standin' on the sofa drinkin' Dom Perignon, strapped up with the Uzi
Step aside when I'm on the move
Pay attention cause I got the juice
You can feel my presence in the room

Wrote on your sneakers young nigga
Servin' illegal my nigga
Duckin' them people my nigga
Smokin' my reefer my nigga

 [Intro]
Astronaut
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating
Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to St. Tropez
Oh you done blow more checks than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a young nigga with this check and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I bought was that Bentley truck

[Verse 1]
I could turn a stripper to a diva
Chinchilla on her, that's a PETA
Shawty light the gun like Bonita
Rockstars goin' like the Beatles
I took styrofoams to the meeting
Three cellphones when you greet me
Got a bitch waiting in the lounge
I done had to move a few pounds

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at my chain, don't drown
Andy put the diamonds in his mouth
All bad bitches pop out
When a nigga steppin' out the house
Every day we walk the red carpet
Every day one of my hoes fallin' in love

[Chorus]
I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating
Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to St. Tropez
Oh you done blow more checks than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a young nigga with this check and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck

[Verse 2]
All I do is pop more bottles and give 'em to you
All they ever do is bring more problems than listen to
My chains, my ring gon' bling, they do all the seducin'
I was kickin' shit with yo' bitch, she did all of the choosin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at my chain, don't drown
Andy put the diamonds in his mouth
All bad bitches pop out
When a nigga steppin' out the house
Every day we walk the red carpet
Every day one of my hoes fallin' in love

[Chorus]
I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating

I wanna listen to everything that you have to say
You make me feel some type of way

[Hook]
When I put my hands on you

When I put my hands on you
I'ma hold you close and I'll make you feel like you're safe (I'm hold you close girl)

Extravagant lifestyle

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad
She harder than a dime
Finna drop the deuce in fo
Try to scratch a hard nine
If you trying to find these shoes
They gonn be hard for you to find
Rocking presidential rollies, it ain't hard to tell time
I had my ups, I had my downs
In my lifetime, committing crimes
I'm chasing paper everyday
And it ain't hard to see I grind
I'm turning up, I'm turning up
It's gonna be hard to turn me down
I'm a motherfuckin star and it ain't hard for me to shine (straight up)

[Verse 1]
Papi got dem packs he bout to turn up with dem bands
Catch some diamonds in your face, if you look over he ain't glance
100 racks in all hundreds, tryna stuff em in my pants
I'mma make a movie on you, any time I get a chance
She gonn smash the crew and I don't have to give her no advance
Just to be in Future presence, she do everything I'm sayin
She love the kid, I swear this girl my biggest fan
I does it big, I take the gwap and make a fan (let's turn up)
I'm in your city with them real niggas whipping work up
I'm gnarly and I'da call me a wave, surfer
I'm solar system high, you know I'm faded, off purple
My shoe game killin these niggas, murder

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad
She harder than a dime
Finna drop the deuce in fo
Try to scratch a hard nine

[Verse 2]
They say I'm screwed up, and I've been leanin all weekend
With yo girlfriend, loving the crew, The Weeknd
The new Giuseppe's, I had to purchase by the bundle
Them presidential Benz's, you can tell I'm doing numbers
They jocked a nigga style and they had turned me to a monster
I was swaggign to the max, I had to turn it to some commas
It fucked wit me a second, got it right back out the jungle
I'm eatin five-star dinners, living like my nigga Stunna
Get some cash nigga, get some fetti get some lumber
Make it rain money, make it hurricane, thunder
Running to the check, while the check steady coming
I ain't gotta flex, cause I'm really getting money

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad

[Intro]
I remember, it was New Years. We was in the studio when I did "Chosen One", my nigga Double D was there
I started sayin' "Louis V. Chinchilla" cause he had the chinchilla and shit. Real, you know what I'm sayin'? This that Super Future, fire-marshall-Future, Future Hendrix, you know the wizard, you understand me? Yah dig? Yah dig what I'm sayin', man?

[Chorus]
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything
You know I hardly forget anything

[Verse 1]
Gutta nigga 'til the dirt
Margiela my fur
I was overdosin' on Perc's
Wakin' up, drinkin' that syrup
Bentley Spur with the curtains
Balenciagas, my proteges
I wear them shits like Michael Js
Wash the molly down with champagne
Wash the xanny down with syrup, yeah
Hope it take away all this damn pain
Hope it take away all this damn pain

[Chorus]
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything
You know I hardly forget anything

[Verse 2]
Crack in the bushes
I'm tryna buy me a new 88 Cutlass Supreme
Every day hustlin', I gotta go get it
I gotta get Wu-Tang, man, gotta get cream
Long as they print it, my niggas, gon' get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finessin' you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up
Now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it
They'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up
And put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we juuged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin'
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit
I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated, try to fight the demons
Tryna find right and my wrong, hope my legacy live on
Hope my legacy live on
That's why I wrote this song
I ain't have to write this song
Future Hendrix is forever

[Chorus]
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything
You know I hardly forget anything




 [Intro]
Tried to tell them niggas think outside the box
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus]
Got too many racks on me, can't fit in the wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist
You got that hate all in your soul, can't do nothin' about it
You got that hate inside your soul, you can't do nothin' about it
Got too many racks on me, can't fit in my wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist
You got that hate all in your soul, can't do nothin' about it
You done sold your soul, you can't do nothin' about it

[Verse 1]
One for the money, yes Sir, two for the show
A couple years ago, selling blow in Mexico
Was a starter, something good
Now I pull up in the 'Rari, I'm in my hood
Yeah, just rollin' that dank up
Niggas ain't never wanted no war with us
Niggas ain't never did fly with us
Bitch my clique notorious
Bet you can't come close to this
I sit in the back of the whip like this
Got a bankroll like I'm still serving that fish scale
I did a girl in private, she don't wanna hide it
Before you tell your mamma, you need to run it by me
I'm takin' this personal nigga like Monica
I do what I want, I go fuck up some commas
I keep a strap on me Osama, you know I came and conquered
I put the hustle in front of me, you know a nigga a monster
You know a nigga piranha, you know I hop out at any time
And I'm in Chanel and Prada

[Chorus]
Got too many racks on me, can't fit in the wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist
You got that hate all in your soul, can't do nothin' about it
You got that hate inside your soul, you can't do nothin' about it
Got too many racks on me, can't fit in my wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist
You got that hate all in your soul, can't do nothin' about it
You done sold your soul, you can't do nothin' about it

[Verse 2]
You in them cuts 'cause that's your hiding ritual
You at your grandma house, you posted up
You put that chopper on IG
You ready to let it go to make 'em how to believe it
You hit your block an' get in it
You hit that block an' get in it
You used to glorify this life, nigga
Yeah, them niggas took your life, nigga
You see how niggas think about you?
Now, you layin' on the pavement
Nigga, bleedin' from your backside
'Boutta take a long vacation
Pour out Hennessey for you
Pour some Hennessey for you
I know that's your favourite drink, nigga
(I know that's your favourite drink)

[Chorus]
Got too many racks on me, can't fit in the wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist
You got that hate all in your soul, can't do nothin' about it
You got that hate inside your soul, you can't do nothin' about it
Got too many racks on me, can't fit in my wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist
You got that hate all in your soul, can't do nothin' about it
You done sold your soul, you can't do nothin' about it

Little nigga get money, fuck around with hating shit

They tried to count me out, nigga I'm staying lit
Fuck around, took a loss then I planned this

[Verse 1]
Ain't taking no shots, nigga I'm mad rich
Made myself a boss, nigga and I'm savage
Lean talking that talk, I don't put a address on it
Full grown 36 zones, ain't no flex on it
I'm putting on, and my money long, ain't no hex on me
Got a photon with a little chrome with a big Tec on me
Take my advice, you gotta get it in, in
Here come another one, all we do is win, win
She know I'm draped up with the cash on me
I'ma cash out on the Spider
El Chapo my idol
My watch as a chain, it's a brighter
Hot as a flame, a lighter
Training my hoes like fighters

[Hook]
Little niggas get murked around with that hating shit
Little niggas get dirt, fucking with that hating shit

[Verse 2]
In the 'partment, I was in your baby momma
In the 'partment, I was in your baby momma
On the carpet, I was hitting your baby momma
Took the carbine with the 50 round drum
I'm the sergeant and lieutenant where I'm from
I'm a Martian, I'm really 1 of 1
No bargains, I'll buy a different one
I pull up where ever I want, I do whatever I want
You take her on dates and I won't
You holding her hand and I won't
You do whatever I won't... and I do whatever I want
I got her mouth when I want , she let me hit when I want
You like the tricking, I won't
You claiming that bitch and I won't

 [Intro]
Feel me
The music special
It's a part of us
I know I'm a product of the streets
I remember days you would laugh with me
See a frown on your pretty faces
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can, can, can

[Verse 1]
Open up a seal, don't feel me
Showing out in public show the real me
Pouring up in public, damn, I hate the real me
My mama stressing out, she say these drugs got me
And I ain't been the same since that nigga shot me
Holding on that K, I hope you feel me
Loading up the cartridge right now, I hate the real me
Voices in my head, "you the enemy"
I got a portrait in my head, I built a dynasty
I gotta focus on this bread, you tryna marry me
Couple exotic ones in the bed, tryna share me
Few exotics going out they way, tryna smash me
She told her mama she tried to smash me
She told her friends she tried to smash me
She told her ex she tryna smash me
She told the world she tryna smash
I'm in the last lane, fast speed
I do helluva ways, baby, go to South Beach
I do helluva ways, baby, let your mouth speak
I do helluva ways, baby, let your body talk

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can, can, can

[Verse 2]
Lemme tell the world how much I care for you
I paint a picture, gave a style to you
I took a chance when you had miles on you
I should've fucked and blowed some loud on you
I'm in the cut, I got a crowd on me
Infatutation turn to love on me
A sober mind wasn't good for me
'Cause I love you way more than this music
That's when shit was brought up and you know I had to lose it
Damn, I almost lost it
Said it was cheaper not to keep her and it's killing me
'Cause damn, I hate the real me
Damn, I hate the real me
'Cause damn, I hate the real me

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Zaytiggy
I'm tryna get high as I can

Damn, I hate the real me
Damn, I hate the real me
Few exotics, they tryna share
Tryna find a true love, you can't compare
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get fly as I can
I'm tryna get fly as I can, can, can




 [Intro]
Step on the scene forget about it
I bought her racks forget about it

[Chorus]
Why you hatin’, why you hatin’? Oh I’m fresh
You must not feel how I feel, oh I’m fresh
I just popped open a seal, I’m on X
Lil’ shawty sittin' at Blue Flame, sent me a text
Future high demand, Future high demand
I don’t walk on land, bitch I don’t ever walk on land
I float off Earth, always float off Earth
Diamonds doing the Chris Breezy, ohh

[Verse 1]
She comin’ through in the wee wee hours
Went to the Hawks game in a helicopter
Said "I want me a white bitch" and I copped her
Future high demand, Future high demand
I don’t walk on land, bitch I don’t ever walk on land
George Jetson, you can’t see me noooo
Do numbers like Boston George on Vimeo
I left that bih cause she was sleezy, ohh
You can’t be saditty and greedy, no
I hid some money and I got plenty mo'
Stashed in the walls, stashed it in the floors
I dig a grave and bought a tombstone for the money
Stuffed a casket full of faces, got a tombstone for the money
Bought a foreign and a spaceship, bought a tombstone for my money

[Chorus]
Why you hatin’, why you hatin’? Oh I’m fresher
You must not feel how I feel, oh I’m fresh
I just popped open a seal, I’m on X
Lil’ shawty sittin' at Blue Flame, sent me a text
Future high demand, Future high demand
I don’t walk on land, bitch I don’t ever walk on land
I float off Earth, always float off Earth
Diamonds doing the Chris Breezy, ohh

[Verse 2]
She ain’t runnin’ out of flavor, I went to ice her
My number one bitch with me, it excite her
Let my shit go, blow the bitch, go to the cypher
The type of pussy, it’s gon' make you want to wife her
We do a whole lotta numbers, yeah
Grab on that pussy like Donald
Porsche got a little bit of trunk
But it’s goin’ over 200
Turtlenecks all on my collar
Love when a pretty bitch swallow
I did it up, gravity
Super so radically
Awesome, gnarly, woo!
Heavenly, rapidly... got killers on McAfee
I do it immaculately
I’m all in her mouth like a cavity
Cold as the polar, I keep it precise
I go to space in the middle of the night
I gotta talk with that pipe in my hand now
It could be a threat or a fan now
I can’t get caught with my hands down
I can’t be comin', my man’s down
I put some bodies up under ground
That’s a few millions up underground
Murder for money, that’s man down
Kill more than police across town
Better not get caught with your hand down
Better not get caught with your hand down

[Chorus]
Why you hatin’, why you hatin’? Oh I’m fresher
You must not feel how I feel, oh, I’m fresh
I just popped open a seal, I’m on X
Lil’ shawty sittin' at Blue Flame, sent me a text
Future high demand, Future high demand
I don’t walk on land, bitch I don’t ever walk on land
I float off Earth, always float off Earth
Diamonds doing the Chris Breezy, ohh

[Outro]
Super Fuuuuuuu
Super Fuuuuuuu
Super Fuuuuuuu
Super Fuuuuuuu




 Yeah... they just couldn’t wait for the opportunity to tell me “I told you so”




 [Hook: Future and Snoop Dogg]
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Fighting, shooting, killing, riding, cripping, tripping, spitting fire
In the kitchen, baking pies, taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun, fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody, buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL, lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya, and get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut, talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging 20 Crip cuz
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement

[Hook]
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling bunch of pies, snatch a Benz

Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

[Verse 2: Future]
How many will ride open up that fye
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off
I grew up on the side you gotta make yourself a boss
Niggas'll shit on you any chance they get
Cross you out on a lick
If you ain't ready for the ending then quit
It's a dirty world, you gotta get your hands dirty
I'm going for the title with my hands on the rifle
I put in the same work you put in, survival
Looking at my rival, they looking suicidal
Keep them bodies off wax, I can spot a rat
Let the guitars play, brraaat!

[Hook]
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

[Verse 3: Future]
Slang a bunch of packs, and go and snatch a Benzo
I played them streets as a young nigga, ain't never liked Nintendo
Them gangstas in the yard, them my motherfucking kinfolk
They'll kidnap you and yo broad (in broad) daylight, no pretendo
I grew up 'round a bunch of monsters, apply that pressure on ya
Be so scared for ya life, you call the police on ya
You ready say you ready
You gon' starve or you want fetti? Yo life'll change a second
Good or bad, don't open yo mouth, make sure you shut it
Ain't no telling who listening, make a wise decision
I'm from 'cross the tracks, like Boosie
If you ride, you better know who shooting

[Hook]
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya




 (Hook: Future and Snoop Dogg)
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

(Verse 1: Snoop Dogg)
Fighting, shooting, killing, riding
Cripping, tripping, spitting fye
In the kitchen, baking pies
Taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun
Fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody
Buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL
Lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya
And get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut
Talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging 20 Crip cause
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Future)
Open up that fye
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off

[Intro/Outro: Future]
We on that drank we on that drank
I got 20,000 on me by mistake
How can I not ball until everything fade away
How can I not, how can I not

[Hook: Future]
How can I not make a movie
How can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not? How can I not? How can I not?
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
How can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing

[Verse 1: Future]
Run in your spot, smashing your ho, fuck on your couch
Quit running your mouth, pimping my pen beginning to end
Telling the plot, look at my watch, fuck all your thoughts
I appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want
Brag all I want, how can I not make you niggas regret
How can I not go and get me a check
How can you not get hooked on percocet
How can you not be the one who was star
How can you not be the one who was king
How can you not come around and I stare at these niggas and niggas be rocking this bling
Cum bitch then cum again, how can I not want to fuck your friend?
Proper game make em all wonder how it feel being with a pimp
Everyday something different money cars clothes different
Me and money got a chemistry, me and you a big difference

[Hook: Future]
How can I not make a movie
How can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not? How can I not? How can I not?
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
How can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing


[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Gotta get this guap, set down that block, scrape them pots
Gotta call this plug, count this check, how can I not
Gotta work them spots, work them Glocks, watch that clock
Gotta move these bricks, I'm on probation bitch I'm hot
How can I not get all this money give all my niggas in the hood a block
Buy a drop and another watch then flex some more nigga how can I not
Them freeband niggas got all that money but BMG how we stamp them blocks
We remix bricks in Mexico you know we take a half off top
Jugg with my money nigga how can I not, fuck you mean I got 20 spots
Niggas swagger jacking off of Future trying to steal his spot
Cause we make that million dollar music and we off the block
Drought season hit up hector phone nigga how can I not


[Hook: Future]
How can I not make a movie
How can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup

I'm nervous, you nervous

You workin,' I'm workin'

And we both fiendin', I guess that's our agreement

And neither one of us tryna look for a blanket
Got questions on questions about what answers, I know
Because when we're drinkin'
Your spirit, my spirit illuminates through our bodies

Eye contact exchanging favors, I guess it's better you know me

And I was sittin' at home lonely wishing you was here
Now I'm thinkin' to myself "Why I ain't already leave yet?"

 [Hook x2]
I’m moving on, I’m moving on
I can’t believe how many times she called my phone
I can’t believe how many times I did her wrong
I can’t believe how many times I did her wrong

[Verse 1]
I keep it interesting
For her, it’s no finessing
She love my style so when she shop, she let me do the dressing
She shoulda learned her lesson, fucking with me is a blessing
Infatuated with my presence, now she feel neglected
I bought her so many presents, it’s one to break there
She been a1 with a nigga since the first day
Just to pack it, she gon’ pack it in her purse
I got her jewels, she ’bout to pull up with that work

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I tried to make up for it, put her in a Beamer
I bought that bitch a crib, been some years since I’ve seen her
I know I’m coming there and hey, I might need her
A gift and a curse when you’re fucking with a hustler
She know I got a curse, she just want me to fuck her
And you still hurt me when I lie to her
I can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her
Can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her

[Hook x2]

Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Chorus]
These bitches ain't shit, we fuck 'em together
I change up my hoes like I change up the weather
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
Bought a couple bags, pussy on splash
Dropped a little cash, that's all that
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot

[Verse]
I can't wife no thot, forty at my spot
Smashed her in my drop, got some crazy top
I done damn near wrecked, off that hoe neck
I got a little bit of flex, I damn near was obsessed
All that is is a bougie freak
Saddity bitch from Laguna Beach
Pussy good and her throat deep
Sucked so long, made her nose bleed
I ain't savin' no slutty, I hit her and her and her buddy
Bought the freak a little puppy but she ain't nothin' but my cuddy
I can't wife no thot, suck my dick till she see snot, huh
Came from out the slums, fuck these thotties 'cause I'm hot
Hunnid round drum and I shot it on the spot
Codeine on her tongue 'cause I'm drinkin' syrup alot
Did a donut out the lot soon as I turned out the parkin' lot
I can't wife no thot, no, I can't wife no thot
I had bought some Cartiers 'cause that mouth there on lock
Gucci sock get Louis top, big chain made her pussy pop
Earrin' got her lashin' out, walkin' round like a rental cop
Checkin' bitches, they be on the 'Gram
Check her phone, I think she tryna scam
I ain't tryna save these hoes, no thank you, ma'am
I hit that nanny on green-green, swallow my cum, no ring-ring
Red Ferrari a mean ting, I got a mean ting
Came with her panties, I gave her some lean-lean
I gave her the clean-clean
She want that molly, I gave her a green bean
She took off her wing-wings
I had to put her inside of the Bentley thing
Fucked up her Maybelline
Maybe she think she more than what she is
Maybe she thinkin' queen
Maybe she think Civil gon' save her
Maybe she fuckin' 'round with the neighbors

[Chorus]
These bitches ain't shit, we fuck 'em together
I change up my hoes like I change up the weather
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
Bought a couple bags, pussy on splash
Dropped a little cash, that's all that
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot
I can't wife no thot, I can't wife no thot

[Hook: Future]
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
If you knew what it took

[Verse 1: Future
All them nights in platinum, throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I get it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

[Hook: Future]
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to wash off this pain
And when them drops stopped
That's when I come to my senses and I finally realized
I'm scarred for life, and fuck the hype I go hard for life
Ain't it precious, I'm thankful
For every second I'm in the leather room
My phone up, actin like a piston
You so caught in the present
You don’t wanna stay down for your prison
You bout that drama, drama, I want that llama, llama
Behind these raps behind that trap I ask my baby mama
Go see my vision, my dreams maybe too big for you
You better thank god everyday I had a kid by you

[Hook: Future]
All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

[Hook: Future]
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that

[Verse 3: Future]
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to hide the tears running down my face
And when them drops stopped
I come to my senses and I go hard for my block
Kirkwood for life, Lil Mexico I got so many stripes
I coulda went to war twice andcame back nice
With a few scratches all I need is some green plastic
And I go morherfuckin get that cash
I'm a survivor, with plenty fashion
And a whole lotta soul with my voice raspy
I'm gonna try to spit my lung up
When the sun down till it come up, find a way to come up

[Hook: Future]
All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

[Hook: Future]
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took

 [Intro: Future]
We ain’t trippin’ on none of you clowns (not at all)

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

[Verse 1: Future]
Sippin’ on my sizzurp, shinin’ in my blizing
What up to my lil’ mama, and I salute my main thing
I get paper fast, quick, fast lane, no roof
I’m higher than a space cadet, airplane, no Coupe
And I’m drinkin’ raw, raw lean – good juice
And I rep Lil’ Mexico for real – we gon’ shoot
And I got a stable full of bitches, feed ‘em horse food
And her booty real, real fat – she Toulouse
We inside the VIP on drugs, and good drank
And I’ve got them racks on me now, I’m the bank
She want the red bottoms on her feet, she choosin’
We wanna fuck a Freeband nigga, we ain’t losin’

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good

Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
LA Reid signed Future – he good
Future signed me – I’m good
Now they know my name around the world
In every hood – for rappin’ ‘bout jewels
Got a stomach full of Freebandz – I’m full
I’m good, I’m off the moves I pull
Plus I’m a street pharmacist, supply all the drugs
Meetin’ at the round table, money with plugs
Got a million-dollar company, Freeband major
When you got this much money, man, it come with haters
Every night, me and my bitch, we count up the paper
I’m good, I done beat all my cases

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good

Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

[Verse 3: Future]
I don’t know where I’m at, I’m in Saint-Tropez
Money take you places, I’m talkin’ far away
I make another movie, I’mma win an Oscar
The way my niggas movin’, won’t need no imposters
We too deep in the game to ever fuck with lames
I’m an astronaut for real, and we are not the same
We ran through plenty bitches, experienced hard times
We grind so fuckin’ hard, and put it all behind
I went to NASA, I’m Super Future now
They shoot a chopper, ‘bout the Future, talkin’ hundred rounds
I’m on my Black Amigo shit, I need a thousand pounds
You wanna triple up your money, send it out of town

[Hook: Future]
The money treat me good, my bitches treat me good
The ‘hood treat me good, the streets, they treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Life treat me good, the ice treat me good
The clubs treat me good, the plugs treat me good
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good…

Jumped up and I poured a fo'

Swear a nigga just seen a ghost
That money comin' in overflow
Codeine all in my Sprite, Future live the rockstar life
Astronaut at the same time, gone to Mars at the same time
Pluto, Jupiter, same time, pick a planet at the same time
I'm trippin', I feel ig'nant, keep rollin', keep sippin'
She lookin', she wit it, my girl gon' have a fit when
She find out how hard I'm diggin' her friend, shit, I'm trippin'
But this exactly how a nigga feelin', when I'm higher than the ceilin'
Can't feel my face, it's numb, and ain't got no feelin'
And I'm in NASA blowin' strong, what the fuck I'm on?

I take off, I blast off, I razzle, I dazzle
Got horses, no saddle, my bitches are badder
With asses that's fatter, you trip and you chatter
I don't even talk, so it don't even matter
How high I get, over verses I spit
I dirty my Sprite, put it down in my kidneys
I'm goin' to space, she wanna come with me
The girls are pretty, the nights are long
Aye, no sleepin' for us, when we drinkin' tough
I gotta stay up, I took me an up
Now I'm buck as fuck, I go fill my cup
I crumble my kush and fill my blunt up
I'm close, I'm chillin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I put the place all into motion, in motion
I grind and grind, keep goin' and goin'
I'm blackin' out on track, like I don't know where I'm at
Talk to Scotty and he talk right back
I'm diggin' your body, your ass really fat
I'm losin' my breath, asthma attack
I'm so busy I be gettin' dizzy
When I get drunk, Juice, I get sloppy, pissy
I blow good good in every city
Countin' money, palms still itchy

Fucked up in the Phantom like Tony Montana, bitch let back the roof
Your girl down on my head, she grippin' that head just like a wave cap
And I get them bottles poppin', Juicy J don't save caps
I can't match this kush with yah if you smokin' babage
Addicted to the weed, I'm a fuckin' addict
I'm smokin' back to back, back to back, back to back
I flip a stack to stack, rack to rack, ball to the max
Smokin' all this weed, so geeked like I don't need lungs
Hate on me, I'm smokin' for free, you niggas ain't got the funds
And I keep a dime bitch on my side, plus a nina
And they both will get you wet like Aquafina

[Hook]
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'

 [Pre-Chorus]
Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Young, fly, and reckless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless

[Chorus]
Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Verse 1]
Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today

[Chorus]
Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Post-Chorus]
Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Young, fly, and reckless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless

[Verse 2]
Let 'em hear the exhaust, show 'em you a boss
Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice
Gotta keep the Draco
Bust a nigga; Tadoe
Runnin' up my pesos
Runnin' up my cake though
14 carat gold, I'm a motherfuckin' ruler
Upper echelon, you my motherfuckin' student

[Bridge]
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd

[Chorus]
Gotta live the wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin is comin', it's comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

[Outro]
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd




 [Intro]
It's a light day
Ain't got on nothin' but about $700 thousand worth
That's it
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I was havin' trust issues
But I've been havin' way better luck since you
I know it's true love with you
Told myself I don't wanna fall in love with you
Rollin' on the eway speedin'
Friday, just started the weekend
XO textin', you respondin'
We gon' go crazy with this money
We do hot yoga, 92 degrees
Can you stretch it out? Stretch it out for me
I got somewhere to be, but it's hard to leave
When you do it like you mean it, I'm proceedin'
Is you the one? Is you the one?
Then she looked me in my eyes
Told me, "Fuck them pussy niggas
They ain't ridin' 'cause I'm ridin'
And I'm dyin' for you, baby"
Got me feelin'

[Chorus]
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible

Girl, take it all out 'cause I know you active
Did you come to talk or is you 'bout that action?
Diamonds on my neck, moonwalkin', Michael Jackson
I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to keep my baby spoiled
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to shake these haters off
Put it  off, fuck the cops
I just wanna show you off
I can see your flaws, she gon' take me how I am
Hit it from the back, girl, you know I'm goin' ham
Fuck the pigs, girl, you got me feelin' like the man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible

I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil

I'ma do whatever it takes to shake these fuckin' bitches off
I'ma do whatever it takes and you gon' be my personal
Dance, dance, girl you dancin' like you strippin' for this gold
Romance and we've all done been here before
But your passion, I hear it when you're talkin'
We ain't clashin', you quiet when I'm talkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'em Billie Jean moonwalkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'emmmmm moonwalkin'
You get into everything exclusively, I'm honest
We don't need nobody comin' inbetween this money
These niggas already tryna invade the embassy
Good thing I changed and you got that remedy
The best thing about you, oh you're that far from me
You a star to me

[Chorus]
In-in-incredible

Its different for us we had to go and earn it
I stay away I see them niggas lurking
I stay away I see them niggas lurking
I stay away I see them niggas skin
[Verse 2: Future]
Ran on the bed but I thought I was dreaming
That money dirty so I gotta clean it
That money filthy so i gotta wash it
Can't let a pussy nigga 'round my pocket
Can't let a sucker nigga come and stop it
Can't let a hating nigga come and pop me
[Verse 3: Future]
Hoes taking pictures they love me
Niggas I grew up with ain't that funny
I ain't ever gone change for the money and i'll never let you come and take it from me
[Verse 4: Future]
Fans lock me up ask was it worth it
I looked at them and said dam right its worth it
I hear the more I smile i'm earthly
Up early trappin' when them birds are chirping
I ride around and i'm servin
I close a lil niggas curtains
[Hook]
Ain't got a label im independent

[Verse 8: Future]
I see the judge give my nigga forty
They just gaveled and sentenced him
We the shit nigga where you been
We let a 18 wheeler burn the men

Always working never calling in
Always working never calling in

To chase this money, will we make it? thats a myste-ray
I'm pissed today
Found out some shit that got my temper hot
These niggas fake just keep it real, is you a friend or not?
Pretenders got me fuckin' mad and so I spend a lot
Cause blowin' paper seem to stimulate that tender spot
These men are not no competition dawg I roll alone
And shawty beggin' so I gotta let her tour the home
But if she wanna be my the queen she gotta hold the thrown
And understand that I ain't bussin' off of oral alone, take off that thong

I need that vice versa
Yeah yeah this be that vice versa
Yeah yeah you know that vice versa
Yeah yeah and if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya

See I ain't stoppin' til my life stops
You see these white socks
Probably turnin' negro as I'm runnin' from these white cops
Who want me in that ice box
But fuck them pigs, all they wanna do is beef
Them boys ain't nothin' but some live stock

Yeah yeah
See that's the shit I'm on
Somethin like my weed, cause every time she let me hit I'm gone
Yeah yeah

Quarters bein' flipped but heads and tails and the endin' phase

Vice versa

Yeah yeah and if u tight girl when I pipe ya then I might just hurt ya
You know that vice versa

And I’ve been hustlin’ long time, on a journey
I wake up, go and blow a dime off in Barneys

[Hook]
I’m tryna fuck the DA lady in her mouth though
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though
I got stacks on me, got stacks on me like Alpo
As a young ass nigga I was dead broke
Fuck that fake shit, nigga, fuck that fly nigga pretending
Got young Doolie on the body and I really do miss her
Let’s flip that clip and spray that bitch for big daddy
Let’s flip that clip and spray that bitch for big daddy
I’m tryna fuck the DA lady in her mouth though
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though
I got stacks on me, got stacks on me like Alpo
As a young ass nigga I was dead broke
Fuck that fake shit, nigga, fuck that fly nigga pretending
Got young Doolie on the body and I really do miss her
Let’s flip that clip and spray that bitch for big daddy
Let’s flip that clip and spray that bitch for big daddy

Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Gats hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out

[Verse 1]
I get on the stage and I rap 'til I pass out
Hit another city and another city, I'm just groovin'
I was tryna tell you I was losin'
I was gon' tell you I'm improvin'
I done caught a vibe, she was choosin'
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta keep my focus, I'm phenomenal
Once I cock and load I'm the money man
Got a hundred hoes, got a hundred Xans
We gon' party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
And my college girls talkin' kung-fu
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
You would never see what I'm goin' through
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta take my time with these bad bitches
I don't wine and dine with no bad bitches
Send a flight for a bad bitch
Over night for a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch

[Verse 2]
I never told the world about you
I never told the homies 'bout you, not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you, not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
That's not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico, kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
It's mafia all day
We come out the hallways
Murder in broad day, murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool in my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now
Our foundation built on loyalty, you can't ruin me now

 [Intro]
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

[Verse 1]
You would fuck a rich nigga for the fame, won't you?
You would give that pussy up to a lame, won't you?
Like a old school, I re-did the frame on you
I got my old shooters with me and they land on you
Word to them niggas at the six
A whole lotta lean, my nutrition
They should've told ya I had the drank on me
They should've told ya I brought the bank with me
They should've told ya I keep that molly on me
They should've told ya I got that stick with me
You the one who duckin' from a drive by
My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes

[Hook]
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

[Verse 2]
I keep a shooter with me like Malone
I fucked around and did it on my own
Come and fuck with me baby, I'm a franchise
Molly and them xans got me aggravated
The hundreds and 'em fifties, get 'em separated
Put them hundreds and them hundreds, yeah we segregated
They tryna take the soul out me
They tryna take my confidence and they know I'm cocky
Fuck another interview, I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck about lil hoe, I let a young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tryna make a pop star and they made a monster
I'm posted with my niggas, let the champagne flow
A nigga was depressed now my mind back healthy
A product of them roach in 'em ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day
Baptized inside purple Actavis

[Post Hook]
They should've told you I was on the pill
They should've told you I was on the Lear
I serve cocaine in some Reeboks
I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

[Verse 3]
They should've told you I'm was just a trap nigga
I'm in the white house shootin' craps niggas
I gave up on my conscience gotta live with it
This remind me when I had nightmares
These bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
They should've told you I'm was just a trap nigga
They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say your last words, can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit it, I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just work for money, I count it on my own, fuck

[Hook]
They should've told you I was on the pill
They should've told you I was on the Lear
I serve cocaine in some Reeboks
I full of so much chronic, need a detox
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

[Outro]
You the one who duckin' from a drive by
My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes




 [Verse 1]
My mama said "fuck it, nigga, hit the streets and live"
Got some crack in the corner and I did what I did
The neighbors they don't like me, I got J's at the door
Told my grandma I don't need a bed, I'm sleeping on the floor
Got my tool and my blow, them my two main hoes
Me and all my woes stick together like the Zoes
Sak Pase, who got the yay for the lows?
And I keep birds with me like I'm straight out Hollygrove

[Hook]
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)

[Verse 2]
I'm a dog, and I eat that dog food
I'm a G, I put red on all my shoes
Come and see my la familia got peru
And I plead not guilty until proved
Got more birds than the zoo
Got chickens in the coup
Got shottas that'll shoot
And I stay on DJ Screw
When you drop it, it coming back like DJ Clue
I make a profit, I can go and buy a school
Ima A1 nigga can't lose
Free Band Gang put you on the news
Then hit Blue Flames shoot pool
Put 20 in my tru's thats 20,000 fool
I put a play together, like Peyton Manning do
I'm rapping dope to you

[Hook]
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)




 [Intro]
Pluto
I can see it written all over your face
You doubted me from the first day
And it never went away
So I say this...

[Chorus]
Girl I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I wanna thank you, I need to thank you
'Cause you made me a hustler

[Verse]
You not a part of my destiny, I tell ya
I was just servin' that fishscale in lobbies, yeah
This money comes faster than a mothafucka and it's obvious
Pour some more syrup on me
Throw some more dirt on me
But I'ma never give up
Top down in the wintertime, fuck the temperature
They got it heated, now we undefeated
Comin' so conceited, but I really need it
Eight figures, big tippers
Yacht party, a hundred strippers
Can't record it, it's confidential
Presidential, shout out Allen Temple
Fundamentals, keep it really simple
Richard Mille, I did for OGD
Save it up and send it OT
Makin' mills tryna OD
I'm in the Hills tryna find peace
These Bel Air neighbors so nosy
Black Draco, got me cozy
It was perfect timing like a Rollie

[Chorus]
Girl I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I wanna thank you, I need to thank you
You made me a hustler

And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me

I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

Haters coming faster then I ever seen them come before
Racks on racks they say I was a one hit wonder, where I go
To the top where I belong, Im from the corner slanging stones
20 mixtapes in a year, you know the type of shit I'm on
Fly, shit, only, thats just the code that I live by
Tell me I can't do it, it won't work, and Ima' still try
Try to hold me back and doubted me, they did it several times
You can never underestimate a nigga like my kind
Ima' rebel, Im a warrior, and I'll destroy ya
All these dues I paid you go need more than a judge of lawyers
You put my back against the wall, Ima' come out standing tall

[Hook]

Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium

Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers

Put the stash 'round my wrist, that's that china white (sorry)

Drop top with no head on it, that's brain-dead, family
My car cranked without no key
I'm turnin' up, you go to sleep
I whipped me up that V12
I pull up in that V12
I got a hundred bands in my email
I'm on the yacht, no sea shells
On tough sand I touch bands

High tops, no lace up

Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet

[Verse 1]
Fell in love, she done got attached
Let her tell it, we a perfect match
Go to Paris, do the dashboard
See the wheel on the right side
Got her driving on the wrong side
Thought we was driving on the wrong side
Out the country for a couple months
I gotta keep the goons all in line
Hotel lobby like a club, got me drinkin' on raw wine
Steaks and shrimps on your plate, baby
We can chop it up, but I ain't wine and dine
Rude girl, you the right sign
You the right kind, this the right time
We can kick it off and go to Iceland
You see they bitin' like Tyson
VVS' wasn't given to me
And them skirts, I'ma give 'em to you
No confessions, you can book the suite
I might even let you book the villa
Po' me up and let me get right
Chains swinging, this a pair of ice
Maintain, go to paradise
I'ma send for you, book the last flight

[Chorus]
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet

Braless swag is complementary
Audemars is confidential
Credit card, expensive dinners
Fancy cruise and double M
Like you signed to Maybach dem
If you run across my BM, better not throw no bloodshed
Better not cut no fuss at them
Better look the other way, I know you fuckin' him
You gotta let me have my way, that's why I trust in you
Presidential suite, baby
You gon' be there for me, yeah yeah
Your girlfriends always hatin'
You richer than them, that's real facts
I keep you fly, that's real facts
I get you high and a little upset
These niggas, they small talkin'
I bet they never cut a real check
Stay in the mall, flossin'
You ain't never been late on a bill yet
My name come with all these benefits
If you fuck a nigga who famous?, you better

[Chorus]
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody

Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet

That's a thousand grams a year
I don't have to weigh it up or use a scale, huh!
Cause I know keys!
I just left Puerto Rico
With Ebony, Samantha and Alicia
Cause I know keys!
I got five different cars
Nigga I got five different broads
Cause I know keys!
They're like oh, my G!
Every time I'm showing off my pieces
Cause I know keys!

[Verse 1: Future]
I'm a mother fucking genius
Shit, I was gonna be modest
But this bitch a nigga with looking just like a goddess
I can't help but to pull up in a brand new big body
I got cheese!
Versace in my closet and I'm dressed up, paparazzi
I pull up a hundred thousand
I can have a thousand tacos pull a right next to
I'm talkin' with the straight face, nigga ain't smiling
Riding round with the unit, remixed it and ballooned it!
Scale on top of that thing, you know we're done perfumed it
I had to take a five, I done charge a five for driving, nigga!
You're talking about the squares, I know how to get rid of em'

[Hook]
I don't have to weigh it up or use a scale, huh!

 [Intro: Future]
My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a king pin you hear me

[Hook: Future]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

[Interlude 1: Future]
Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

[Verse 1: Future]
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
Esco came to me, he said they think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one
We going back in as soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him in custody they took my life away

[Interlude 2: Future]
People didn't even understand that my hard drives that I recorded all my music on for two years straight was on this... was on this one hard drive that Esco had and he was locked up with it so I had to record new music. That's when I did Beast Mode

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggy's
I endured so much pain, ain't got Esco with me
Ain't got nobody smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealing with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag we getting back to the paper
Getting back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hating
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick laying on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doing some real life porno

[Bridge: Future]
And I ain't worried about nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour (fuck that shit)

[Hook: Future]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

[Verse 3: Future]
I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give them what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in projects, they just know me from rhyming
My hard work finally catching up with perfect timing

[Interlude 3: Future]
You know what I'm saying, I could take a hundred dollar slab and goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

[Hook: Future]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

[Outro: Future]
Everything in the streets, it prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now. The good and the bad, you know what I'm saying? Can't let none of this shit get to me. I go harder cause I know where I was at, and I know where I wanna go

[Intro]
I was so hardheaded at first
My grandma didn't even believe in me
I kept goin' though
All I can say is I told you
Jewelry at the bank now in the vault
You should've never doubted me
I'ma work 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah you should've never doubted me
The pain and the struggle followed me
My daddy never been there, bothered me
And these cold streets made a man of me
Know a time, it'll come, they doubt me
Had to keep them OGs 'round me
Keep a young, young homie grounded
You never know where your motivation'll come from
We do the most for these broads and pop Chandon
They try to push you aside, you gotta fight some
I had it on the dot and now we ride guns
I want that number one spot, I'm like icon
I got that beast in my eyes, I'm like Tyson
With my heart and my drive, I know I'm righteous
Keep some ice on me, Rocky, Rocky like Balboa
Once you win, win, win you gon' want more
Set a trend, trend, trend, need an encore
I was down on my last when I found myself
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath

[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I came from them quarter waters
Every nigga in my gang unemployed
You fuckin' 'round, you must want a gang war
I got ol' girl, then I transport her
Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
I'm hotter than a flame, keep the fan on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it

[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath

[Bridge]
Who knew I would take it to a whole 'nother level
Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation

[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath

[Outro]
I got tears in my eyes
My dreams all I got and I'll die for it
If I love it with a passion, I'ma ride for it

[Chorus]

Bitch came through for a few, that's a layover
Bitch came through for a hour, that's a layover
What you been doin'? I been chillin' at the crib, poolside with some pretty-pretty bitches tryna get a tan
Had some Chinese freaks come over to the crib last night just to fuck, [?]
Had them Chinese freaks come over, tried molly, now they wanna ask Shoota "Do we got them xans?"
Tell me you don't want no parts with this
Tell me you don't want no parts in this
Tell me your heart ain't in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit
Your heart ain't gotta be in this shit
Your heart ain't never been in this shit

[Verse]
I'ma flood some ice on both of my wrists

Baby came over, she a new vibe
Baby came over, she a new vibe
Tell me that you ready for the turn up right now like me, just like me
Don't tell me that I fuck you so good, you don't wanna leave, you don't wanna leave
Got a case of Hennessy in the fridge on chill for you
You need to call up some more girls, tryna feel on you
Pretty girls they in my collection, baby don't get caught out there flexin'
And you got that Birk' on your shoulder, and I got them racks, won't fold up
You can't pick a hood don't know us
You can't pick a hood don't know us
You can't go nowhere and they don't know us
You ain't for them lights and the cameras when I roll up
So I fuck your main thing to keep her composure
Rollin' up dodie, and I'm gone off soda
Don't I keep that red drink with me like Piru?
Then I put them solitaries in it, go to Caicos
Fuckin' on the sand, baby they don't understand us
Fuckin' on the sand, baby they don't understand us
Christian Louboutins on your feet when you stand up
Now I'm gettin' fed up, cause tryna bed fuck
Actin' like a nigga don't know she bout a dollar
Actin' like nigga ain't got no models
I'll fuck a pop star at this time here tomorrow
These girls walk around, these strip clubs ours
Goin' out the country, get that dirty money, gotta watch who did the laundry
I gotta get it rainstorm, sleet, or sunny
I gotta chase this mofuckin' money

[Chorus]
I ain't talked to shawty in a few days
But you already know, girl I been missin' you
I ain't talked to shawty in a few days

I'm a mothafuckin' giant
I see how you watchin', I see how you lookin'

I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline
I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins
They gon' ride for me
I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha
They gon' lie for me
I got some people they know that I love 'em
But I ain't got time to see
I see in people the moves that I'm makin'
You know I'm playin' for keeps
You niggas ain’t seein’ me, never, you’re never gon' see me

[Verse 1]
I got big racks, all in your face and you 'bout to get silent
Big ‘Bach, fuck that little bitty car that you’re drivin' (skrrt, skrrrt)
Big racks, anything I'm whippin' barely got mileage
Big racks, and you know that bitch that you’re with, she mine
Yeah she my bitch, nigga
She wanna hit on me under the covers like lovers
Like we divine
She recognize that I'm so thorough
I'm one of them breeds, I'm all on her mind
She wanna look me eye to eye and tell me her lies
I had accepted you
Just like you came and never look down on you
Tell that lil nigga to stay in his place before I expose you
You take one shot at me, you know that'll cause an explosion
Never fight the hand that feeds you, nigga
You gon' pay a nigga, yeah, to squeeze the trigger
You an itchy finger blog type of nigga
And you know me, nigga

[Verse 2]
I got way way too many issues
Some are coming out on the internet
Baby girl sayin' that she miss you
Is it too late for a comeback
I had to live with this crown on my head
I don’t got no regrets, I don’t have no regrets
I got to live with this crown on my head
I got to talk to my homies up stairs
Sorry to tell you I gotta address it
Feeling this game and I'm learning my lesson
Accepting the hate when it's coming
I jumped out the Wraith on them bums
I tell you you're wrong when you're right
I'm never gon' judge, no I’m never gon' judge
You got a nigga, but I know you love me, baby
I know you love me

‘Cause all I’m seeing niggas all the biggies in your city

You know that I’m gonna make homies ride for me, it ain’t nothin’ to get ‘em

Pull up in that ‘Rari, ain’t no no Facade
Shoot in broad day, he shoot in broad day
Shot the whole window up in broad day

Ey, it's been a long time coming, babe
Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
I didn't call to start a new relations, no
It's been a long time coming, babe

(Verse 1)
You ran across my mind, and I ain't trippin'
[?] canary yellow birds are drippin' off me
I was young when I fucked with you
You wouldn't understand the person that I grown into
I put in overtime inside this vocal booth
It's amazing how crazy in love you wit' the kid
I used to hold you by your waist and you'd look up to the kid
You was out cryin', why you ridin' on the kid
We should've won an award off the movies that we did
We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing
I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen
We was friends before all of this
I wanna see you happy girl no matter who you're with
On some real shit...

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Over the weekend went to Vegas, crossed my memory
I was taking out the limo thinking
How much you was there for me, I got you forever, wherever
That's just the man in me, I look at you like family
Wanna see how you been doin'
I turned you to a fucking beast
Remember how we ran the streets and fucked until we'd go to sleep
I know you ain't forgot that, I doubt that
Even though that nigga housed that, you still left yo heart back
I'mma wait for you to call back, I'mma fall back
I'm over that, yeah
Ay, let me reflect for a second
Nuttin' serious tho'
I'm happy than I ever been before
You need some help, don't hesitate to hit me up, you know
I ain't on that lil' boy shit, girl I'm just lettin' ya know

[Verse 1]
Was it cold nights that made me cold
Do the stress increase my hunger
Tell a lie then make a promise
Fish like a man nigga, fish, hit nigga this a fucking hit
Send a nigga home full clip, traumatized by the whole trip
Boatload full of cocaina
Got some wolves 'round and some hyenas
Bought a AK like this bitch a nina
And I know I got a billionaire demeanor (Future!)
Pourin' up the Dom Perignon
Fuck a pussy, [nigga] fuck a pussy 'til it's numb
Put the pussy on a nigga tongue
'Til the pussy juice runnin' down my lungs
Ain't another better feelin'
Like the feeling when a nigga make it out the slums
Stackin' all my racks on racks
I got my niggas rich, I'm at the top where I belong

[Hook: Santigold]
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head

[Verse 2]
Dressed up in all black leather
Bodybag .38 special
Ain’t a bad bitch a nigga treasure
Need money on a whole 'nother level
Good time, nigga good time
Barrel longer than a guitar
Never sacrifice who you are
Then you turn yourself into a star
Turn myself into a avatar (Future!)
Put the OG in my 'gar
Take a penitentiary chance
That's a change, eat shrimp, steak, caviar
Bloodline is a lion
Fly nigga
Walk and say when I walk, it look like a nigga flyin'
Fuck your lies and your bullshit you tryna sell me cause I ain't buyin'
Green minded like a slave field, niggas picking green like it's cotton
Money getting' burnt, money fire
Franck Muller or the new Chopard
Frank mattress nigga Frank Lucas
Real life on wax
Not your ordinary film or movie
Phenomenon when the commas come
Kill the winter and then when the summer comes
Ex con, 100 rountad drum...Batman the paint James Bond

[Hook: Santigold]
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head

 [Intro]
Extravagant Hendrix
Switch hands like left pitcher
Super astronomical

[Chorus]
Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, "here you go"
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white Rolls
We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, nah

[Verse 1]
Three rings on my left, I feel like King James
They see the way we represent, they see the way we get it
You can't be never slippin', you gotta show you're different
I came through and took all their bitches with me!
Nigga I get all the way faded, I can't get tipsy
All these seven star restaurants on a
Daily basis?, I'm guilty
Let this champagne start pourin', drank it up 'til it's empty
Got this V.I.P. section burnin' like a chimney
We ain't gotta emphasize nobody, we done bought the building
Let's go zip out Australia, we can go to Switzerland
We got a chauffeur and a translator for where they don't speak English
Sometimes when you speak from your soul it sound like you singing

[Chorus]
Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, "here you go"
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white Rolls
We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, nah

[Verse 2]
Gotta put a whole lot of kush into my lungs
I put a whole lot of work in, I just begun
And when that green money on the turf, it's their call
Gotta put that steel under my shirt and duck laws
Fuck the cops, she gon' ride just like my dog
Chinchilla, I put it on and let it fall
Gorilla, let it drag on the floor
I forgot to get the money and lay low
We take shoppin' sprees, I can bring the store to me
I don't get trap money, please, bitch I'm out their league
Raf Simons, Rick Owens, cost 200 G's
Cash out mad G's, bustin' down AP's
Handmade 1 of 1 Riccardo Tisci
Crystal diamonds on my sleeves, L-O-V-E
Changed the whips about a week, yes I do agree
Louis V on my carry-on, yes indeed
Have to pay for it tonight as you charge a fee
Order the PJ at 1, we land tomorrow at 3
Steak and shrimps, caviar for seven days
Let's flick it up for my dawgs in the cage

[Chorus]
Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, "here you go"
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white Rolls
We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, nah

[Outro]
Always keep it real with you!
Lookin' exotic
Got a half a mil' on me
'Bout to recount it now

Go 'head and ash it on the floor now
Girl go 'head and show me how you go down
And I feel my whole body peakin'
And I'm fuckin' anybody with they legs wide
Gettin' faded with some bitches from the West Side
East coast, nigga reppin' North Side
Never waste a ho's time (Freebands)
Bitch, I'm on my own time
Fuck a nigga co-sign
Always change my number and my phone line
Baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service bill cost your whole life
If they try to stunt me, I go all out military
I'm camo'ed all out, like I'm in the military
I free up all my niggas locked up in the penitentiary

If she catch me cheating, I will never tell her sorry
If she catch me cheating, I will never tell her sorry
Porsches in the valet, I got Bentleys, I got 'Raris
Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'
Bitch, I got the juice and the carbine
Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty
Runnin' with the wave, get you killed quick
Shoot you in your back like you Ricky
Lil Mexico, from no life to afterlife
My whole life, my whole life

[Hook: The Weeknd + Future]
