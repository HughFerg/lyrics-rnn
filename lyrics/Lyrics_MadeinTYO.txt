Cause that boy up now I'm searchin' for a bust down
Got a flow it's clutch now
Take a seat sit down
Kicks on compound

Yellow bone mouth wild

Please just release the flow
More slice than a pizza hoe

Bad bitch eat a hoe
Tryna rap to meet a hoe
This that women eater flow
If she clean I eat her tho
Why she look like pita dough
Three times super flow
Dyin' in that pussy tho
Shakin' like the holy ghost
Never try to do the most
Put me in the super ghost
Fuckin' wit a super G.O.A.T
Wonder why they hate the most
