Float like a butterfly, sting like a beamer

 [Chorus]
Who is you talkin' to, turn into barbecue
Keep talking shit, I'ma spark at you
Lie to my face like you getting cake
Pussy boy, show me a dollar fool
You shining, that's how I spotted you
Them diamonds I gotta get off you
That's a closed casket, put him in a basket
Headliner, it's breaking news

[Verse]
Smoking on dope, chilling with the guys
While you at work pullin' five to nines
I'd rather go pull me a crime
Or hit the club throwin' up signs
Nigga diss crip then he dying
I got two white hoes snorting up lines
But I don't do dope drugs
But I'ma fuck on both of 'em
Stack my hundreds, nigga no ones
I don't really fuck with no one
Super Saiyan on these niggas
I might turn into a Gohan
Got my hand on the trigger
Nigga playin', shoot both of 'em
Nigga playin', shoot both of 'em
Nigga playin', shoot both of 'em
Shoot a fire with both arms
What is you sayin'?
Can't make demand, we used to do store runs
And your daddy is a bitch
'Cause he got his ass kicked by Grandpa Joe's son
Young nigga you a ho's son
And you gon' have a ho's son
And it's really fucked up
When y'all getting locked up, y'all can't make no bond

[Chorus]
Who is you talkin' to, turn into barbecue
Keep talking shit, I'ma spark at you
Lie to my face like you getting cake
Pussy boy, show me a dollar fool
You shining, that's how I spotted you
Them diamonds I gotta get off you
That's a closed casket, put him in a basket
Headliner, it's breaking news




 [Intro]
Hey man, hah
I'm in beast mode, you feel me?
Feel like Marshawn Lynch in this motherfucker, you heard me?
Ayy shut up lil ho
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit anyway
Always laughing at shit that ain't really just be funny
You know get you some money
Man matter fact break the cigar down, make yourself useful ho
Hah

[Verse]
I'm in beast mode
I'm a dog, put me on the leash mode
Hungry, I'm so hungry, I'm in feast mode
GTA, left down right up, ayy I got cheat codes
Plug with the chicos, they call me amigo
Nigga tried to rob me, he must thought this shit was water
Heard his daddy dead, time to send him to his father (that's on my mama)
Married to the money, told her meet me at the altar
Throw a bullet at you and you caught it, Miles Austin
Stone Cold Steve Austin, flexing like a wrestler
Spongebob, tartar sauce, flip it with the spatula
Fucked your bitch and pulled her tracks, she got mixed and mastered
Get my granny headed to the Bay, now that's a Packer
Thumbin' through the twenties backwards just because it's faster
Call you niggas Adam Sandler 'cause they is some actors
Bitch I'm respected, no pastor
You smell the kush every time I walk past you
Your bitch she watch me like I was a plasma
Polo tee, rock [?] Castro, ayy
Don't give a fuck what a hater say
By any means, bitch we gon' make a way
Thirty-six bows on the interstate
Andalé, andalé, andalé
You say that you got it, ain't nothin' else to say
I call up my takers now they on the way
They won't hesitate to take a nigga's face
Chopper up on him, make a nigga race

[Outro]
Woo, beast mode, beast mode, beast mode
Like I said man, I feel like Marshawn Lynch in this motherfucker man
I'm tryna get thirty of them touchdowns and get up in the backfield, you feel me?
Beast mode, beast mode, beast mode

 [Chorus]
BlocBoy be the next to blow, I serve you gas like Texaco
We don't smoke no Reginald, you can't beef with a vegetable
Plug live in Mexico, he serve me P's for extra low
AR with the fucking scope, now where the fuck his head just go

[Verse]
First day back up on the block, it's still murder on the opps
Call up Bands, I need a chop, I chop 'em like the barber shop
Serve you like I deal a lot, I love guns, bitch I kill a lot
Money, I keep bills a lot, them choppers make you Milly Rock
San Antonio to shoot you, I call that Ginobili
Niggas snitching on they niggas, tryna keep it lowkey
Riding 'round like we T.I., my nigga we four deep
When you see me in the street, my nigga you don't know me
It's my first day out, it's my first day out
You ain't beefin' 'bout no money then that shit is played out
I got the bald fade now, I can cop all J's now
Man I came a long way from the halfway house
Back on the block, twenty-three Glocks
Watching for cops, I got gas in my sock
The way that I'm flexing, you'd think I'm The Rock
I load up my weapon and aim at your top
Teach a nigga lessons with the Smith & Wesson
I send them bullets at you like a message
I do not love 'em, I work 'em like peasants
I'm at your house like I'm Santa with presents
Laid in a Phantom
I stitch it up like a nut to a hammer
I move that white, call it Hannah Montana
Come in your house with them purple bandanas
Bet you can't handle
Make that boy strip like a dancer
Kidnap your mama for ransom
Your bitch she love me, I'm handsome
Thirties on forty, turn him to a phantom

[Chorus]
BlocBoy be the next to blow, I serve you gas like Texaco
We don't smoke no Reginald, you can't beef with a vegetable
Plug live in Mexico, he serve me P's for extra low
AR with the fucking scope, now where the fuck his head just go

New Stingray, I'ma speed race
San Andreas we gon' do his ass like CJ
I got a gun but I ain't gon' use it, that's a dis-play
That's why everytime I see you, you go this way
They say that I'm broke, well I'm bringing out the racks again
They say that I'm a hoe, till I pull up and in all black again
The black Chapo, all this work that I be traffickin'
They took me on a boat, just to go serve some Africans

 [Verse]
Thirty on the scale, weigh it up and then go sell
You know I keep that shell like I work at Taco Bell
Get my pack straight through the mail, got a cane on me no player
Heard a nigga dissed the block, load the Glock, let's give him hell
If a nigga lookin' strange to us, we smoke him like angel dust
No uniform but that forty tucked, you say the wrong thing, I bust
You better listen, this is not fiction
Keep me a thirty extension, clip hangin' out like a lynching
Somebody just called, they ex missing
I hit her ass up, [?]
One ear open, I hear everything
I heard them niggas sneak dissin', tryna get some fame
I think them niggas want some clout, or a name
I'ma pull up at they house and let that forty bang
All my niggas real hitters, they don't miss a thing, or a mane
Flag hang to the left but all my niggas every gang (that's on my mama)
Heard them niggas wanna kill me
I'd rather catch a case or fucking plead guilty
Niggas want me six feet but I'm six feet with a .50
Cougars, I love them cougars, my bitch filthy
Rugers, I bust them Rugers, then start dipping
Weapons, we aimin' steady, we not missing
Sevens, you see them sevens, bitch we cripping
Liver, these niggas Chicken Little, 'cause they snitching
Bitches, they be bitching, come together like a stitching
One day I will be up on the big screen (that's on my mama)
Hah, like I said
I'm a crip but my infra bang red
Your team ain't ate but them niggas still fed
You know I'm big grape, should get it tatted on my head
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Hah, like I said

Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat

I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

 [Verse]
No Chorus, Pt. 10, finna cop a van
Pop a nigga ass like a fuckin' perc ten
Hit him with the bag like I'm in the first dance
Thirty to his back, leave him gone with the wind
I'm gettin' head like a motherfuckin' mannequin
If you gon' bust at me why is you panicking?
Thirties all up, leave a fuck nigga vanishing
I hit him up, ain't gon' lie, it was challenging
Say he getting money but where it's at?
I'm the alley, O'Malley cat
I'm in the jungle with lions and birds
To the left, that's how I like my hat (crip)
Freak hoes, I'm striking it
Beat 'em up, Mike Tyson it
Fuck the bitch, he ain't liking it
Made a post 'bout me, lost his life today
I'm 'bout to pull up
I'm driving fast, I thirtied the mag, you know what it's full of
He 'bout to crash 'cause I shot his ass before he could look up
That nigga shook up, brain got took up, names got looked up
Commissary, get your books up
What's wrong with him?
AR to his head, I'm 'bout to dome-split him
Heard a nigga want me dead, I had to go'n get him
Put bananas to his head like Donkey Kong hit him
My money long nigga
Yours small, mine tall, get your own nigga
I was only fourteen beating grown niggas
Got big forty with the beam, this ho go long nigga
Ain't no way that I'ma miss and hit the wrong nigga
Chopper get to spitting wherever, bullets get to hitting whoever
Bitch I keep the eagle, no feather
Shoot a nigga just for the pleasure
Nigga better not play 'bout my cheddar
Nigga's ass better know better
Say one thing, spark him up with the Beretta
Bitch I got them rounds like I'm Floyd Mayweather
Mayweather, bitch I'm hot like May weather
Forty on my side like we go together
Y'all niggas broke and y'all hoes too
Pussy ass nigga I expose you (that's on my mama)
She suck my dick, baby girl got no tooth
Connect with the plug like I'm wifi or bluetooth
I remember days when I had to wear Fubu
When you a nail everybody wanna screw you
Shop with me, shop with me, I turn a drug deal to a robbery
I gotta kill him, on crip ain't no stopping me
He tried to play me like I was monopoly
Damn, damn, scratch a nigga out his Lamb
2013 Lito, bitch I go ham
I got chill like Doritos, no food stamps
We making moves and shit, my niggas be hitting licks
Shot a nigga down just like a cigarette
If he on some business shit
Load the forty Glock up and go hit some shit
I swear we ain't missing shit
I would never ever fuck on a groupie bitch
Unless she give benefits

[Outro]
Hold up, I think I fucked up on my ass, lyrics gotta go over
Then them niggas hating on me, pull up in that Rover
Fucked a bitch last night, only bought her a soda
Gang, and I'm up off in a Lamb, I pull up, whip through in a Lamb, yeah yeah yeah
Fuck on your bitch I go HAM, fuck on your bitch I go HAM, yeah yeah
Fuck her and tell her to scram, fuck her and tell her to scram, ayy, yeah

 [Intro]
No Chorus, Pt. 5 nigga
BlocBoy, BlocBoy

[Chorus]
Turned up to the max, I know my block got my back
If a nigga talkin' foul I'ma smack him with a stack
Your bitch in the club dancin' so I smacked her on her ass
If you try me with that fuck shit I'ma come back with the MAC

[Verse]
All that loud talkin' he doin', I swear I got somethin' to silence him
Infrared beam, no silencer, walk around like I'm a scavenger
Shotgun up on me, no passenger, in the midnight, no dub vision
Bitches called me ugly when I had Levis, got fire with True linen
Bitches be gold diggin', lookin' for gold
A bitch can't get a booger out of my nose
On the block like Boozer but ballin' like Rose
You known for this bullshit, you know how it goes
Bitches is bitches and hoes is hoes
Never wife a thot, you know they gon' go
Water whippin' pots up on the stove
Somebody tell 'em they plugged with they nose
No I'm not that guy but when you see me bitch you see money
I'm with TP Stacks, then you know we yellin' free C-Money
Thirty on my side, don't run on me, this bitch hold a hundred
MAC up to his back, give me that, I need all your money
Block full of hitters, pops was a drug dealer
Fuck the police, they locked him up and took his scrilla
I looked up in the mirror and I see a real nigga
Still the same nigga that won't hesitate to deal with you
You say that I'm broke my nigga, how is that?
Bitch I'm stickin' to this paper like a thumbtack
You think that that is your nigga but really he a rat
He gon' snitch up on you if y'all get caught with that pack
That pack y'all came in, you can buy whatever
Try to rob me, my clip hold more rounds than Mayweather
Your bitch is not faithful and she bought me a Gucci sweater
But she is worse on it, sometimes I wish I never met her
Most of these niggas they say they gon' ride
But when it's war time they sit back and hide
Them be the niggas that we're not surprised
What happened to confidence, where is our pride
I ride for my niggas, I ride for my guys
If they have a problem, I feel like it's right
Lost Simi and C-Rock 'cause C-Rock done died
And Grape Street the cemetery won't be divine
My new bitch she a mess, seen my text that I sent my ex
So lately I been stressed but I ain't never smoke no cigarette
My mama said I'm blessed, I finish you and still ain't got some yet
If you play I leave you wet, I pop a nigga like a percocet
RIP to Bo, I just pulled up in a Maserati
JJ on the phone, tell him that it's time to catch a body
I'm the same nigga, still ridin' 'round with C-Gotti
Pockets workin' out, sometimes I let them hoes do pilates
Kick it with your bitch, no karate (class)
Nigga sneak dissin', I'ma have to (spazz)
Nigga throw it back, send them hitters at his ass
Now he dead, he don't really need an ambu- (lance)
Young nigga tryna be the bigger (man)
And stack up my dividends
Walk around the block with all of this green on me
I'm feelin' like Peter Pan
Can't tell these niggas stop sleepin' on me
I got your bitch in the bedroom sleepin' on me
She wanna fuck but I don't really even want her
She wake me up like a sunny [?] callin'
You not a rack then you fuck niggas phony
Say y'all is ready but y'all do not want it
Tell your bitch, take it off, real strippers only
Grape on my shirt like Tony, [?]
If there is a problem you will get your face fractured
Couple headshots than your ass fall backwards
Nigga you a bitch and your niggas they some cowards
Bet when y'all was young y'all wanted to be actors
And that's what y'all is, some motherfuckin' actors
Standin' on the block like the neighborhood pastor
Thinkin' you the shit 'til your ass get clapped up
[?] 'cause it really don't matter

[Chorus]
Turned up to the max, I know my block got my back
If a nigga talkin' foul I'ma smack him with a stack
Your bitch in the club dancin' so I smacked her on her ass
If you try me with that fuck shit I'ma come back with the MAC




 [Intro]
Plug just came with the pack so fat that a nigga might gon' and hit 'em with the ugh
Nigga diss the block, wait a minute
Forty with the lemon, hit your body, make a nigga do the fool
This kush right here in a minute
OG gas, make a nigga cough off first pull
My clip got a lil too mini
One up in the head, I don't give a fuck if the bitch full
Tay Keith produced it
Not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, six

[Verse]
C'mon, I'ma keep goin' like a run-on
Pussy ass nigga diss the block so he got his ass run on
Now he like hold on
Grabbin' on his eye, reachin' for someone to hold on
I don't think he smell me so I shot him in the nose bone
Got the bitch naked so I told her put her clothes on
BlocBoy south beach, lookin' like a walkin' sno-cone
No Big Tymer but I told her get your roll on (crip)
Touch his ass up like an iPhone
Fetty Wap him, now his eye gon'
Head knock him, taste like Betty Crocker
I'ma give you an F like I'm Denzel Crocker
I got that word like a fuckin' lager
Keep that strap and your bitch right by my boxers
If you ain't talkin' money then don't bother
Like Shnitzel, all I hear is Rada Rada
All this money, can't give a bitch a penny
I would never change, you can keep them pennies
Smack a broke nigga, what you thought was with them pennies
How many knifes you got? many many many
Clip hangin' out, it's extended-stended-stended
Walk around like a motherfuckin' zombie
Big ass motherfuckin' chopper on me
Posted in the jungle rockin' down dundee
You can say things got wild quickly
When he came at me talkin' too foul quickly
I gave him this shot, I ain't talkin' whiskey
Now he fallin' on the ground like he was tipsy
Hustle hustle hustle, man I feel like Nipsey
I'ma pull a drive by on a ten speed
Three live, smokin' three five with your bitch
And you know she three high, finna get fucked by three guys
Hold on, I ain't finna stop
Ain't nobody cleanin' but we comin' with the mops
Treat you like [?], bro we bustin' at his top (doon-doon-doon)
You can jumped like a motherfuckin' hop (doon-doon-doon)
Bitch tried to set me up, got her ass shot
Savin' these hoes, nigga you a Robocop
Police in the store, servin' in the parking lot
And my gun in your face, would you give me what you got?
Pull up on an opp like pow
It's a man down, somebody done shot up the crowd
Nigga say he smokin' on loud, but that shit mild
I can't hear the shit right now (that's on my mama)
I got your main boo wasted, my dick she can taste it
It's in the bitch mouth like some braces (she suck me)
If I spray, my whole crew sprayin'
What is you sayin'? have you flyin' with the birds, toucan
Beam me like I had a laser (laser)
Rarely eat, just had the blazers (I'm fresh as a motherfucker)
Put a hole in you, no bagel
Bitch I been ballin' on 'em like the Pacers (swish)
My chain and my ear they is glistening (word)
Like damn, look at my wrist again (damn)
My chain need a Pamper, it's pissin' (woo)
I cannot go like this
I will not show my glizzy, I take it on the road every city (word)
I just threw fifty bows to the city
And called up lil Mishio to come get it (that is my nigga)
No OKC but I'm posted with thunder
Pay, Feezy, and Doolie, my young fuckin' gunners
They shot a nigga through a goal like a punter
I fuck her and don't let her smoke on my ganja (can't hit this blunt)
Plug just came with the pack so fat that a nigga might gon' and hit 'em with the ugh
Nigga diss the block, wait a minute
Forty with the lemon, hit your body, make a nigga do the fool
This kush right here in a minute
OG gas, make a nigga cough off first pull
My clip got a lil too mini
One up in the head, I don't give a fuck if the bitch full
Niggas think they killer, is it 'cause the weed and liquor? (I think so)
Fuck your bitch and squeeze her nipples (bankroll)
She suck my dick until it tickles (word)
Gas blunt, I'm facin' it (gas, gas)
Never put my face in it (never)
Your main bitch is takin' dick (woo)
I told her put her waist in it
High as a motherfuckin' fool (fool)
Slice your ass up like a pool (word)
I could've bought five pair of Robins but really said fuck this shit, copped me some Trues (Trues)
Jordan logo on my shoes (J'ed up)
All my dogs Scooby Doo (dogs)
No U-Haul, we on the moon
My nigga Lil Jayden and Rico came through (what it do young nigga?)
Feelin' like I'm bulletproof
Got niggas that'll snuff your ass off of the roof
I talked her and left her, you wife her, good medic
I told her to dunk 'em like an alley-oop
Justin, Aston, CJ, nigga that's my crew
Can't forget about Pierre and NuNu
These niggas they fake like a motherfuckin' screw
Make they ass disappear like poof

[Outro]
Where they at though? where they at though?
Where they at, where they at, where they at though?
Where they at though? where they at though?
Where they at, where they at, where they at though?
I'ma smoke a nigga's ass like crack smoke
I don't even gotta smoke crack though
I don't even do none of that shit
Smokin' on that gas, make a nigga do a backflip
Ooh, I'm too high

 [Intro]
Hah, hah
Yeah, word

[Verse]
No Chorus, Pt. 8, ain't nobody straight
Still got them goons and them hitters in the bay
Pop a nigga like it's a balloon in his face
Say he got a problem, tell goons where you stay
Catch an opp loafing, his ass gotta lay
Heat him 'til he roasted, on crip he must pay
BK like I'm hostin', want lean get a dosage
Gotta watch the neighbors, them fuck niggas notice
He got that bread so I left him toasted
I feel like Melvin, I tuck 'em like Jody
If you want the cheese, you gotta stay focused
I came a long way from the rats and the roaches (that's on my mama)
My niggas I eat with, all of who we keep it
He high as a bird, hit him with the Eagle
Charge him for a feature, lean in the liter
Turn into a cheetah when I see the people
Shooters they shoot when I say so
Pockets on swole, need lip-o (lip-o, lipo)
Freaky lil bitch always tryna have fits
Eat a dick, bitch I'm tryna get rich ho
Then makin' serves at the Citgo
Your bitch suck me up, popsicle
These bitches hit me up talkin' 'bout they wanna fuck
I had a hard time tryna pick which ho
I fuck 'em, don't love 'em
You fuck 'em and cuff 'em, I swear you can't love 'em
Boy your ass in trouble (you trippin')
Hit them with the gas, they on the front page
Homicide with thuggin'
The money it double, my prices it double
I call up Lil Double, leave a nigga lookin' troubled
J, fuck up the play, call up Lil Quinn, money on the way
Bullet in his head, feds on the way
Dick in her mouth, fuck she gon' say
I cannot wait 'til I pull up in Ranges
And shit on my ex and see that lil bitch face
Ball on these niggas like Kevin Durant
If you flex then your ass will get shot in the face
Hold on, I ain't finna wait
If you say you eatin' nigga where the fuck your plate?
How you A-1 when you never had steak?
I ain't got a shrimp but I trap in all states, yeah
Watch out for feds while I count up my bread
I only want top like eraser head
Two-two-three bullets erase your head
You do what I say like it's Simon Says
Two-three the Glock on the side of my side
If you play with me boy then your ass gonna die
In the hood they caught him, pop him in his eye
BlocBoy JB, bitch I'm known for homicide
They give me thumbs up, I think I need rounds
Like I told you before they some hoes in disguise
I can't trust a ho 'cause they tell too many lies
I cut 'em off quicker than scissors and knives
These opp hoes gotta roll though
Two for twenty five, that's a D-Rose
Black stones on me, I'm a negro
You savin' these hoes, you a hero
I ain't blood but I keep a B-roll
Street money, rest in peace to Bankroll (street)
Couple hundred just to wash my nizzos
I'm a crip so I get C-notes (huh?)
Fuck it, I'm about to crack the lawn
Rest in peace to Feezy, pokin' with the feezies
And we're still yellin' out rest in peace Thump
Say the wrong thing, we gon' lock 'em in the trunk
Bruce Wayne sidekick, rob 'em with the pump
But we ain't got no mask on
Bare face, broad day, hit him with the MAC home
Gloves on deck, got me feelin' like Patron
[?] the way these niggas get they act on
These niggas they snake, they snitch on the case
I'm tellin' you just how it is
They lie to your face like they got some cake
But don't got a ten dollar bill (they broke)
My niggas they do this for real
You play, he gon' get your ass killed
It's murder for hire for real
My niggas can body for real

[Outro]
Yeah man
Told y'all we do this shit for real man
BlocBoy JB, yeah bitch I got bars
Everybody know I got bars, Xanax, and all that other shit, you know
Hey, hey, hey, hey




 [Verse]
Ayy, pussy ass nigga done got too troubled
Hit 'em in the eye, they like ooh he cuddle
Make the wrong move, I don't do non-bustin'
I don't give a fuck about who do cousin (that's on my mama)
2017 we got choppers with the beam, nigga
Big dreams, that's the Martin Luther King nigga
Clip long like a limousine nigga
Bullets run you over like a fuckin' limousine hit you
We got them killers outside
Where you gon' go? you got nowhere to hide
AK they come with the knives
I stick you and shoot you, how you gon' survive?
The plug is comin' at five
Stretch 'em, he won't be alive
How many P's? five
What you gon' do? I'm gon' split it with the guys (that's on my mama)
Niggas they hate but they keep it in disguise
It's not my fault that you work a five to nine
Broke, and I got a server runnin' in and out the door
All about the bill like I live in Buffalo
Said I got a server runnin' in and out the door
All about the bill like I live in Buffalo
Nigga tried to rob me, turned his ass into a ghost
Two O's in the back, gave his ass a double O
Nigga tried to steal my cash, so I went and fucked his ho
Nigga done made me mad, so I sipped a hundred some' goin' to the door
Hit the club, I'ma act a fool in this ho
Came through the back, got my tool in this ho
If a nigga make the wrong move in this ho
Glock two, now dude on the floor
Found out where he hide mane, I'm about to ride out
Car ain't brand new but this coupe got some drive 'bout
Pull up on your boo, she like ooh, pull that iron out
I'm an OG like Doe B, let me find out
Your bitch gave me head, yeah she good with the dill pickle
Hundred on his head, fuck it, that's just how I deal with you
Tell the streets the truth, BlocBoy JB be the real nigga
Forty make your whole team run, track and field nigga
Plug just came with the pack so fast that a nigga might go'n head hit him with the uhh
Now I'm like uhh, feelin' like Soulja Boy, hit 'em with the you
Nigga I'm a gangbanger, I'ma let it bang bang
I ain't talking car game, bitch we can do it
Make a nigga bling hang, I did him cruel (what's up?)
Police come, watch me maneuver (I'm gone)
I do not beef on computers, I give it to you like a distributer
Niggas they singin', call 'em Marvin Lewis
That's why when I see 'em, shots at they medula
Got on my knees and I prayed and always said my grace
Who knew I would blow up in the freezer?
Tell all the niggas that hate get the fuck out my face
Bitch I'm icy, shoutout to my jeweler
XD's with the coolant, shots at your medula, all my niggas shooters
Kickin' kack, C'in cool with the ruler
But I'm not a tutor, pull up like an Uber
Toasted like a strudel, boiled like some noodles
Then feed you to one of my freaky lil thots
We servin' soft, we don't mix it in pots
Might run in your spot and hit you with the Glock

[Outro]
BlocBoy next up, time to run a check up
Hands in the air 'cause girl I'm a flexer
Flexer, finesser, bend her, undress her
Choppers, berettas, all up on the dresser
Ayy, haha, I told y'all niggas this shit don't stop nigga
Whole lot of crip shit nigga
Nigga know what goin' on man
And I'ma die behind that nigga, crip

If you really want a crease, use the iron for that
Now a nigga need a piece of his spinal back

Ke-ke-keep that, keep that iron for that
If it's an altercation, nigga we use nines for that

 [Intro]
Bet twenty more, I hit the first roll
Freaky bitch on go, she gone off the road
Run up in your house like I’m commando
Clip hanging out the Glock, extendo

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

[Verse 1]
Strapped like it’s Belly, you singing, R. Kelly
You play it get deadly, it's Grape Gang, no jelly
I'm counting up fetti, you talking already
I pull up with choppers that come with machetes
I’m fucking on Betty, her head got me steady
I call her Lil Caesars, that bitch hot and ready
My gun a Lil Caesars, that bitch hot and ready
I dumped my lil bitch, now that bitch hot and jealous
Hold up, let me catch my breath
Shoot a nigga 'til he dead say he killed himself
Fill 'em up with holes like a criminal
Paralyzed waist down, now he can’t feel himself
Ride with my guys man, I swear it ain’t nothing else
Freaky bitch, I make her touch herself
I’m balling in town, look like fuck a ref
Leave his ass stanking, I blow him like bad breath
Woah, double-oh-seven, hit him with the weapon, gotta
Go, when the police come, dip underground
Spend a hundred somethin' when I move around
Lil bitty boy, you still eat off the ground
You see them Haitians, they up on the Gram
Shh, don’t make a sound

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

[Post-Chorus]
Bet twenty more, I hit the first roll
Freaky bitch on go, she gone off the road
Run up in your house like I’m commando
Clip hanging out the Glock, extendo

[Verse 2]
Homicide, bitch we known for that
Screenshotting shit, I text her, you too grown for that
Yeah that trap shit, I got two phones for that
I’m a dog, I think that I got a bone to fetch
Stop what you're doing
Thirty-three in my clip, that’s Patrick Ewing
Open up wide, girl I’m looking for the chewing
Shawty gave me head, now I know what she pursuing
It's the nina with the coolant
Mask on, AR, bitch that’s on my side
PRG, 700, we don’t let shit slide (crip)
We don’t let shit slide (crip), nigga play with me I ride (crip)
Bitch I’m cripping with the guys, We get up with three high fives

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

Came a long motherfuckin' way from Fila

[Chorus]
I got two pots, I got two stoves
I got two hoes, I got two bros
I faced two grams, now I'm too gone

I got two Glocks, feel like 2Pac

I remember days when I ain't have a shoebox
Came a long motherfuckin' way from Fila
I remember rockin' two socks with the Reeboks
Now a nigga got the J's with the G-Shocks
P-90 Ruger, four-five with the D cock
Only thing these bitches get from me is deep cock
I was down, looked to the ground and couldn't see rocks
Police really don't want me to come and see pops
Asking God why he took my homie C-Raw (rest in peace)
Shoot, shoot, what they wanna do
I don't give a fuck, take it how you want to
I'm the shit, baby girl check out my jeans True
And if you try me on that fuck shit I'ma let it loose

[Chorus]
I got two pots, I got two stoves

 [Intro]
Ayy, I got a rack
Run up in that house and tell that nigga give me that
Bad bitch with me, yeah you know I'm on that
Other bitch went off and I hit her from the back

[Verse 1]
Ayy, hold on
Got your bitch turned up, need to put some clothes on
Shots fired at his face if he play with my home
I keep one up in the chamber and I put one in your dome
If you play with my home
Them niggas on the other side playin', it's cool
Choppers fired at a nigga's land, on Duve
On Duve, on God, he ran, I sparked
Now I'm on the run for another murder charge
First degree, if you fuck with me, that's on God bitch
Mask on, when I'm down bad I'm on some rob shit
I up with the carbon, they duck when I start sparking
Ooh I caught my man, goddamn I hit my target

[Chorus]
Nigga playin', pull up get to sprayin'
I got them hitters in minivans
Search for you niggas from land to land
I sold your ass like a candyman
Put a hole up in your fitted
I'm in V-Live and it's litty
I got your bitch shaking ass and her titties
Foreign bitch and I think that she is British
You get to have like a minute

[Verse 2]
Squad up nigga, don't move
My niggas wanna jack with the tool
You see me, I see you
Royal rumble with the crew
Bitch I ball, Caillou, trappin' two-three schools
System on my tool just to help it cool
Hey hey hey, bitch I prayed for this
Bitch I'm made for this
And my niggas got paid for this
And I really get paid for hits
And my niggas hit crazy licks
Stake out your house from 'bout two to six
I heard that y'all niggas move the bricks
Ice cream, get to scoopin' shit
I got one hand, up on my pocket
Nigga playin' with Lil Bloc so I had to pop it
You like James Harden, I'm the fuckin' Rockets
I stand alone with the heat, guess I'm Chris Bosh-ing
Got the club rocking, freaky bitch give me her topping
Stop that shit, you know they watching
Gas and money, you know I got it
Got your honey giving money
Wash the bitch just like some laundry
Real nigga, can't take from me
Hilfiger, I keep a Tommy

[Interlude]
Keep a Tommy, keep a Tommy
Told the money, keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'
Hold them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, yeah
Throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw the money, yeah

[Chorus]
Nigga playin', pull up get to sprayin'
I got them hitters in minivans
Search for you niggas from land to land
I sold your ass like a candyman
Put a hole up in your fitted
I'm in V-Live and it's litty
I got your bitch shaking ass and her titties
Foreign bitch and I think that she is British
You get to have like a minute

[Outro]
Keep a Tommy, keep a Tommy
Told the money, keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'
Hold them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, yeah
Throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw the money, yeah

 [Intro]
Ayy
Hah
Crip, yeah, crip
You know the crip shit off top nigga (crip, crip, crip)
Yeah, word, word, word

[Chorus]
Who the greatest, he the greatest (crip)
Can't stop, won't stop, we'll never see stop
Blood bitch with me and I think she brang treetops
Four fifty-eight, pull up like a pitstop
Heard you got a safe, tell me where the stash spot
Open up the safe, twelve K, that's a jackpot
Same outfit two days, that's a rerock
Bitches cheerin' for me, you would think I was a mascot

[Verse]
I got the ball and changed the game
Like I'm Chris Paul, I drive the lane (swish)
I move that work like a crane
The shit with the lick, that's a doodoo stain
Check out that young nigga James (word)
Oh my God, that's some Fubu's man
Pull on your block with them rulers man (rrah)
Extendos, extendos on everything (doon-doon-doon)
You play with me, you'll be a dead man
No hoopin' but we on your head man (that's on my mama)
Licks, we got them mollies and bricks
Fuck a bitch and give her head like a pick
Or durag, got a nigga too mad
If he run up on me, open up a can of whoop-ass
Get to steppin', go and get your gun
Them Giuseppes, where'd you get 'em from?
Had a bitch, did somethin' dumb
Fucked a bitch the day after prom
Bitch you know I am the don
Shot them niggas like the sun
Pull like triggers, I'm gun
Fuck that lil ho so she can make my bond

[Chorus]
Who the greatest, he the greatest (crip)
Can't stop, won't stop, we'll never see stop
Blood bitch with me and I think she brang treetops
Four fifty-eight, pull up like a pitstop
Heard you got a safe, tell me where the stash spot
Open up the safe, twelve K, that's a jackpot
Same outfit two days, that's a rerock
Bitches cheerin' for me, you would think I was a mascot (yeah)




 [Intro]
Fuck goin' on?
Hey, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Hah, hah, woo, hold up, hold up, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hold up, huh, huh, word, word, word word word word

[Verse]
Pulled up with that stick, hey, nigga don't miss
Got your bitch, she on her knees, she gon' eat the dick
Smoking strong, that Hercules, you can't tell me shit
Thirty-four ounces of Barkley, Phoenix versus Knicks
Walk in this bitch with my stack out
Please don't run, I got the MAC out
This nigga just made me blackout
I'm 'bout to box him like Pacquiao (doon-doon-doon)
Kurt Angle, I'm making her tap out
Started by pulling them tracks out
This shit is facts now, you can get whacked now
Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo
Riding with my motherfuckin' dogs, bruh
You ain't got no money, I can't call you
Put two up in your back, John Wall you
All this purple on me homie, I'm a baller

[Outro]
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, crip crip crip
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
East side, east side, east side nigga that's C side
Who up on my side nigga, you know I'ma ride
If you play with my side, bitch it's homicide
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo (crip)

 XXL, give your bitch the dick and it XXL
Running from the cops, yeah, we running from 12
If I see a opp, I'm a dump a hundred shells
I don't fuck with Screech, not Saved by the Bell
Ya'll niggas never ever met the cartel
I was walking 'round with 'bout thirty Glock shells
Have you ever smelt the gunpowder?
Pull up on your block like Bowser
Spitting all this fire, ya'll niggas liars
Yo bitch lick the dick like it was a pacifier
I'm a real nigga, I ain't never been a liar
I'm a real nigga, I ain't never been a liar
We can't play no games with no suckers
I don't like these niggas, Uncle Ruckus
These niggas hating, I can't trust 'em
Pull up with the chopper late night, I'm a bust 'em

 [Intro]
I call up Jugg and we make it double
I do not love her but I'm still gon' fuck her
Grape Street nigga with a hundred in the duffel
I ain't have shit, I was used to doin' hustles
Damn, it's cold outside man
Somebody get that warmth bruh, woo
Word word word word

[Chorus]
My wrist is yellow like Pikachu
You showin' your money, I'm lookin' fool
I need a mil before I hit twenty-two
I'm crippin' so I got that grape juice
Grape to the C bitch, I got a play or two
You snitchin' and shit, that's a hater move
I let that forty freeze 'em, igloo
Bullets they size him up, Apu
I'm smoking OG, that's the best
Say you're sauced up boy, you is a hot mess
Bet a nigga smack your ass with an object
BlocBoy JB, number one prospect (that's on my mama)
Bullshit, I don't want nothing to do with that
Fuck on your bitch then I tell her I'm through with that
These niggas pussy, think they related to cats
Fuck on your bitch, pull her hair from the back

[Verse]
I call up Jugg and we make it double
I do not love her but I'm still gon' fuck her
Grape Street nigga with a hundred in the duffel
I ain't have shit, I was used to doin' hustles
Transform a nigga like I'm Optimus Prime
Tied in fourth quarter, man that sound like overtime
I keep them sticks on the forties and the TEC-9's
I'd rather die 'fore I let a nigga take mine
Shine in the dark, make it look like the daytime
Bitches hit me up, gettin' mad 'cause I don't make time
Opps talkin' shit, guess it's load and go spray time
Leave a nigga holy like it's time to go pray time
Whole bunch of hitters, they throwin' up signs
You dissin' on Twitter, we pullin' up straight firin'
Say you got more hoes than me then you lyin'
Talking to a bitch, gettin' head on Facetime

[Chorus]
My wrist is yellow like Pikachu
You showin' your money, I'm lookin' fool
I need a mil before I hit twenty-two
I'm crippin' so I got that grape juice
Grape to the C bitch, I got a play or two
You snitchin' and shit, that's a hater move
I let that forty freeze 'em, igloo
Bullets they size him up, Apu
I'm smoking OG, that's the best
Say you're sauced up boy, you is a hot mess
Bet a nigga smack your ass with an object
BlocBoy JB, number one prospect (that's on my mama)
Bullshit, I don't want nothing to do with that
Fuck on your bitch then I tell her I'm through with that
These niggas pussy, think they related to cats
Fuck on your bitch, pull her hair from the back

[Outro]
Bitch, coke clean like a wash machine
Fuck wrong with you ho
No dish detergent bitch
You gotta come clean like Mr. Clean
We got New Jack City in this bitch
