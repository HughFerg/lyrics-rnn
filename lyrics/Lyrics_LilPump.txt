You can see Lil Pump wandering the halls of a school carrying huge bags of pot
Turns out that school was a local Catholic elementary school
A teacher gets slapped with a bag of marijuana in this video
Yeah, Lil Pump, ooh, yeah, yeah, huh, brr
And the rapper’s name is Lil Pump
Yuh, Lil Pump
Yeah, huh?
(Brr)
Yeah, yuh
Yeah, yeah
Ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches' butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold

[Verse]
Drive the 'Rari off the lot, fuck my wrist up with the pot
Bitch, this shit will never stop (brr), presidential on the clock
Couple hoes up on a yacht, I can not fuck with the opps
Bitch, I made it to the top, go to class, I'm on the drop, ayy
Went to the gun store and I bought a rocket (ooh)
One million dollars, cash hangin' out my pocket (damn)
All these diamonds drippin' on me, feelin' like a water faucet
Broke niggas hatin' on me, man, this shit need to stop it
Lil Pump the freshest nigga comin' out my city
Hit AOD's and I'm blowin' straight fifties (brr)
In the kitchen whippin' Whitney, sippin' lean, I lost my kidney
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me off the Xan', I squeeze a titty, ayy
Dropped out of school, hopped in a private jet (brr)
Bitch, I'm on the lean, I can't pop no Percocet (no)
I got more money than your father, you can't be upset
I'm worth a couple millions, bitch, you know I love to flex

[Chorus]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze

You ain't livin' life like me, yeah
You ain't livin' life like me
Walk with a hundred bands in my jeans
VVS diamonds drippin' on my ring
Spend half a mil' on jewelry, yeah
You ain't livin' life like me, yeah
You ain't livin' life like me, yeah
You ain't livin' life like me, yeah
You ain't livin' life like me, yeah

Ooh, Lil Pump, ooh, Lil Pump
Yeah, yeah, brr, yuh, yuh

Ooh, Big Head on the beat

[Hook: Lil Pump]
I just bought 3 thousand dollar Gucci pants (Gucci pants)
I just left the trap, and I'm off the Xans (and I'm off the Xans)
Bitch, I'm high as fuck, I feel like Superman (what, what?)

Put a Xan in smoothie, I don't watch no movies (I don't)
I go to the bank, take out thirty thangs (brr)
Forty diamond chains, sixty bricks, I make it rain (huh)
And I'm eating Wingstop, posted in the trap (in the trap, what?)
Lil Pump, don't know how to act (damn)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Somebody please tell me where my money machine at
My money dirty, I'm tryna think of ways I can clean that
I spent at least 3 million dollars just on the pieces
These haters think they can keep up, man, they can't believe it
Gucci got a six-pack, they can't believe it
But hey, lil bitch, here's three stacks, let's have a threesome
I wanna own it outright, don't wanna lease it
He wanna be Guwop so bad that he talkin' greasy
She wanna be with Wop so bad that she fuck the DJ
That bitch should prolly' ride a bicycle on the freeway
Three years ago, I stacked my paper the long way
Now I'm stacking million dollar checks up the grown way
