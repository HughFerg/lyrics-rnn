[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
Baby lion goes
Haha
Where the islands go
Yeah

[Verse 1]
None of these motherfuckers could touch me
I don't give a fuck if you think you could
I'll still beat your ass like you from another hood
Still smokin' Woods, still givin' bitches wood
In a wishin' well 'cause I still wish a nigga would
Hah, you ain't shit to a boss
Rev her up like an engine until it give her exhaust
All these rappers I'm killing, I'm turning into a villain
My Nina be a horny bitch the way I'm getting her off
Randy Moss for your boy how I'm pickin' 'em off
I'm pickin' 'em out, these other niggas chickenin' out
I'm chewin' 'em up, pause, then I'm spittin' 'em out
I'm bein' general, don't make me start singlin' out
First thing's first, bitch, keep my name out your mouth
Before the doctor have to take your fuckin' brain out your mouth
I may just show up to your next concert with a AK
Just to see what all that fuckin' hype is about
Now it's blood on my Louis V's
Bad bitch like my clothes, came from overseas
Ex-girl gettin' mad, said she over me
Knowin' damn well that I'm still in them ovaries
Bitch, please, I see bullshit around me
Hoes tryna clown me
As soon as I get money, I bet them bitches surround me
All my money goin' to new clothes and wardrobe
So I can't help but be fresher than Downy
Orange VLONE like I'm straight out the county
Louis Vuitton don mixed up in Givenchy
Same way Hennessy mix up in Bacardi, haha
Damn, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?

[Chorus]
Haha, I've been givin' 'em 30 hours, haha
30 hours, haha, ayy
Du-nu-nu, haha
Aye, y'all like that out there?
Been gamin' for 30 hours
Ayy, look, hah

[Verse 2]
I run laps around these niggas in they school raps
I'm still doggin' with them cool cats
I'm still pretty when I sit back
I break your bitch for the Kit Kat
You niggas broke, you can't fix that
The competition is a mismatch
You think it's cool to fuck with me on a bad day
And lately, I've been havin' a lot of those
You pussy niggas so uptight
That if you put your big boy pants on
You'll be rocking a camel toe
I'm such a animal
I'm such a cannibal
Body parts in my Danimals
I'm super radical
Pussy, you not compatible
You niggas itch like rashes
You claim niggas' after me, so call me cautious
Them hoes used to laugh at me but now they askin'
The whereabouts to all my fashion
If we could have sex on camera
Like I don't have real life standards
Guess I don't have real life standards, huh?

[Chorus]
Hahaha, fuck nigga
Had to give these hoes 30 hours
30 hours, ah-uh-uh
Du-nu-nu, hey, hey
Had to give these hoes 30 hours
Aye, should I give 'em a little more?
I should? Bet, haha, look

[Verse 3]
I'ma just go back in for another, huh
What's the real definition of a brother?
Relation by blood or relation by color?
Hmm, man, I don't give a fuck
I'm just talkin' to talk
This the talk of a boss
Keep playin' wit' yo' boy and I'll be checkin' yo' pulse
Probably put you in a hospital, piss on your bed
While you in a coma and your mama wait for results
Gone

[Chorus]
Haha, gang
Had to give these niggas 30 hours
Hah, 30 hours, hey, hey
Du-nu-nu, yeah
Had to give these niggas 30 hours
Fuck nigga, haha
And we gone

[Outro]
30 hours
30 hours

They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same, love

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out of my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane

I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?

High school, back in high school, she couldn't stand me
These girls are the same (they are)
That's why I fuck 'em all the same, my brother
Drop my top in the rain (skrrt)
No one feels my pain like my brothers
VVS in my veins (ha)
Ice cold blood can't relate to no lover (ha)
Please don't go insane (no)
Over these raggedy hoes, my brother (no)
Hundred thousand dollars in a rain coat (Oh)
Niggas steady hatin', call them Big Joe (Budden)
30 karats hangin' off my pinky toe (pink)
Asking all them questions, why you wanna know?
Shawty wanted drugs, so I made it snow
Walk around, askin' folks "where the blow?" (Lil Boat)

[Chorus 2: Juice WRLD with Lil Yachty]
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love

Same way she come (Same way)

I was blinded by love (I was blind)
But now I can see (I can see, I can see)
You ain’t never made me happy (no, no)
You just made me believe

[Verse: 1]
Realest shit I ever spoke, spoke, spoke
Realest shit I never wrote, wrote, wrote
Mixed the perky with the Four Loko whoa

Damn that’s to numb the pain from these
Scandalous bitches in my brain I mean

Anything romantic turns to suicide, suicide

Love ain’t meant for me
This is crazy, this insanity
Thought you was my lady, now you hate me
Still got the blueprints yeah, no Jay-Z
I wear Gucci, Louis, Fendi kicks just to hide the pain
Balenciaga on my sweater and umbrella for the rain
I always told myself I would never fall in love again
The next day I find a new queen to fall in love again
Don’t got nothin' to gain
I’m sittin' in the rain
She just ruined my life, and she stole my cocaine
I don’t even do no cocaine
I don't want that shit no way
I go that shit for her to increase the foreplay
Yeah

[Chorus]
Same way she come (Same way)
Same way she leave (Yeah, the same damn way)
All women scum
Get the fuck away from me (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)
I was blinded by love (I was blind)
But now I can see (I can see, I can see)
You ain’t never made me happy (no, no)
You just made me believe

Woman speaking
CardoGotWings

[Chorus]
She say she know and I be tellin' a lie
She told me I'm like all of those other guys
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
In my anxiety I'm buried alive
Some of your words are fuels to fire
Catastrophic when you ignite
Do you still want this? You decide
Well, alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, yeah yeah, alright

[Verse 1]
Haha, yeah, mood change, mood change
You have a rainbow on your head [?] moon rain, moon rain

 [Intro]
Am I okay? Am I drowning in...

[Verse 1]
I'm so sick and tired of being such a liar
Restlessness at it's highest, everything's on fire
Sorry but I'm not the type of person you should admire
Time has come so I guess I'll just retire
Destroying you obviously was not my desire...

[Pre-Chorus]
I never really cared what you said
Never thought that you'd change
Now I'm left all alone and you're far away
Guess you finally found a way to run away

[Chorus]
Am I okay? Am I drowning in pain?
And all this hate is driving me insaine
Am I okay? Am I drowning in pain?
And all this hate is driving me insane




 [Chorus]
I smoke another to the face
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm fucked up, tryna clean the mess up
Yeah I fucked up, yeah I had to fess up
I'm a robot for her, love Alexa
When they say her name wrong it's Alexuhh
This is not an ordinary women
I feel like I love her to the fullest
Cupid ain't been shooting at me with no ordinary bullets
That's my biggest problem, I feel overhooked
Shit I was always scared of gettin' overlooked
Consequences in my side, I wish I never looked
Breaking up, never us
Fuck the time, it's forever us

[Chorus]
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain
My emotions in a cage
They keep me contain
They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way
For me to get rid of my shade
Take narcotics to the face
Fuckin' up my brain

They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I smoke another to the face
Whenever I don't feel okay
It's gotta be another way

They keep me contained
She want me out her way
Shorty throw away the key
Love is not a game, I am not ashamed




 [Chorus]
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

[Verse 1]
Take one perc, 3-0 to the face
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang, is it a problem today
They don't catch feelings, but they'll catch them a case
Took your bitch to Cali, you take L's in LA
I just want the Rolly, with the diamonds in the face
Glizzy and the Goyard, [?] on my waist
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray
I put codeine [?], money gangster, pourin' up
If I tell him you a problem, he gon' fuck you up
He told me nothing gettin' between us and these fuckin' bucks
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
So much cash, we gon' need a dump truck
Tryna rob me, you such a dumb fuck
That bitch say she love me, she such a dumb slut
Say he wanna kill me, lil nigga what's up?

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

[Verse 2]
You'll probably kill me if you had the chance, huh
Probably cause I spent a couple thou on pants, huh
Probably cause I got your bitch to dirty dance, huh
Fuck her then I'll leave her, call me Dirty Dan, huh
She scratch her head, like she got dandruff
You is my son, like my name Sanford
Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banners
I ain't Megaman, but I got two cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Said she had fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white hoe

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your sufferin' away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

 [Intro]
Why you mad, why you mad
Why you mad, why you mad
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin in the first place, I'm freezin

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan right
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

[Verse 1]
But you lookin' like an asshole
Up on twitter and you lookin mad woah
Talkin' bout me, but you lookin' bad, woah
Like the ugly daughter that I never had, woah
And whats up with these niggas
Got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably cause I'm doin' better than them anyway
It's probably cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They walkin' in the slums while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan right
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

[Verse 2]
Why you mad, why you mad
Why you mad, why you mad
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin in the first place, I'm freezin
But these haters not breathin'
Stevie Wonder to these haters no seein'
And I don't believe it
They hate me, hate me for no reason
They hate me for no reason, woah
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan right
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah




 [Chorus]

Her contact name is vacuum bitch, cause I know she gon' suck me
Don't know if I'm really handsome, cause the money hide the ugly
She say she wanna cuddle, nah
But I'll buy her a snuggie
I'm sorry, I'm not sorry
To this love shit I'm a zombie, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ball on these hoes, Larry Bird
Talkin' shit, you get hit, you out of words

Then I get in her guts, doctor Miama Surgeon
Ray J with it, I'll hit a bitch first

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ball on these hoes, Larry Bird
Talkin' shit, you get hit, you out of words

Getting top from a bitch yelling, piglet, uh
Look at the way that i swag, uh

Bad bitch, I hit it from the back, uh
I'm in Dior, spend a rack, uh
Maybe a rack on a rack, uh

Run up on me, them pistols'll clap, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
That's my flow
Look at that girl, that's yo' ho'

Pull up on the scene, choppa' spinnin' like a twister

Back end, fuckin' a bitch from the back end

Scratch, scratch on a bitch, no DJ, uh
Boy, I swipe pre-paids, nah

With no delay, huh
My flow crazy, huh
Doped up like the 80's, huh
Big guns like the navy
Rock-a-by with the choppa' like babies, huh, yeah

[Verse 4]
Man, i could really talk some shit on this one
Pull the trues down, i could take a shit on this one
I feel like a baller, set a pick on this one
She wanna fan, she gon' take a pic on this one
Take a picture sitting on my dick, huh
Hit the filters up to make sure that it's fixed
Make it look big, huh
She gon' dance like an Irish Jig, huh, ayy
I'm not a rabbit but these tricks not for little kids, huh
I'm a master rapper, uh
'Matter fact, I'm probably with a torch  and a bitch burning down tabernacles
I get the last laugh

If that bitch swallow my kids
Do that make me a bad dad?, uh
I'm an ass, lad
I'm an asshole with cash-flow, huh
Yo' girl fuckin', that bitch bashful
She got her hands in the air listenin' Beyonce
"Single ladies over here", that's what I say

[Verse 5]
Early to the party
Then again, I'm fashionably late off the molly
Run a train on yo' bitch
That's a stylish ass trolly
Out Dior, spend a couple pounds, nigga try me
Did I say, "a couple pounds"?
I meant a couple thousand
Money in my pocket, could build a platinum fountain
And if I pull up with security
That's my 40
Cause never in my life have i needed bouncers
I been so "fuck this" and so "fuck that'
My bitch talks up it, say, "Get the fuck back"
I feel like a crackhead hiding- woah
I feel like a crackhead hiding work how i spit crack
I got so much drive, if I stop it, you catchin' whiplash
I hit the strip club
Throw a couple bands on yo' bitch ass
I was getting cash ever since I was a youngin'
I feel like Drake and Future, ballin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Pull up on me, get to bussin'
Choppa on me with combustion
My word is my weapon
So is my [?] and i got that from the West end
With a bad bitch, she bussin'
And he best friend more open than a book, uh
She fucked my cousin, I ain't even have to look, uh
Ain't talkin' boxing, I ain't gotta throw a hook
I freestyle crazy, kinda like an open book
That's probably cause when I was little I was reading books, uh

[Verse 6]
See, now I'm smarter
Got my arm in the rim
I'm ballin' like Vince Carter
Always ball like a starter
At yo' head like a barber
Bombin' hard, Pearl Harbor
Try me if you want it
You get smoked like a Backwood full of marijuana

[Outro]
Ain't no weed getting saved around me
That bitch fuck for free
That shit a guarantee
I'm in London, so I tell her she not my cup of tea
Talkin' dumb-




 [Chorus]
It's been awhile since I last saw you
I was cruisin' in the coupe
I was with my crew
It's been awhile since I last loved you
So I don't know what to do
I'm just in the studio
Had to break my heart in two, now there's one half of me, one half of you
But the last time I saw you, I was ridin' in the coupe
Coolin' with my crew, coolin' with my crew

[Verse: 1]
No, no, no, no
I was off the molly, I'm on go mode
Say she wanna make a movie, grab the GoPro
Then she broke my heart, so that's a no no
Life's a picture, I'm just posin' for the photo
I got Givenchy and Louis on the logo
Woah, run up on me that's a no go
In the cut with a Gucci bag, and a four poured

[Chorus]
It's been awhile since I last saw you
I was cruisin' in the coupe
I was with my crew
It's been awhile since I last loved you
So I don't know what to do
I'm just in the studio
Had to break my heart in two, now there's one half of me, one half of you
But the last time I saw you, I was ridin' in the coupe
Coolin' with my crew, coolin' with my crew

[Verse: 2]
If looks could kill, she's a murderer
The boys in the band all heard of her
She a rockstar fan, so she drop when I say
When we off the drugs, ain't no stoppin us
Baby I do what I want, I don't do what you say
In the party with the pills, mix it with the Dusse
I'ma ball til' I'm bald, coah I need a tupee
Kick, push, love like she fuck with Lupe

[Chorus]
It's been awhile since I last saw you
I was cruisin' in the coupe
I was with my crew
It's been awhile since I last loved you
So I don't know what to do
I'm just in the studio
Had to break my heart in two, now there's one half of me, one half of you
But the last time I saw you, I was ridin' in the coupe
Coolin' with my crew, coolin' with my crew

You give me adrenaline, got me fallin' in love
Look at all the scenery, palm trees and mountains
There's a way you got me feelin', I'm thinking that it's the drugs
I lost my heart, I met you and found it
I love our surroundings
The hills and the houses
The smells and the good vibes
You bring them around me
Damn, pretty lady
Let's move to the valley
Driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Let's runaway to Cali
You can be my Cali girl (you can be my Cali girl)
You can be my Cali girl

She is a keeper
She drives me crazy
My Hollywood fever




 (mumbling) Fall down
I ain't finna fall down
Fourth quarter, shorty, I'mma a ball out
Don't go to work, baby call out
Ain't no waitin', no stall now
I'm finna a ball out
Fourth quarter, shorty, no call outs
Don't go to work, baby, just call out
(uh) In the bedroom, all out
Percs on the counter
I can't wait to take 'em
Blunts on the counter
Can't wait to face it
Bad lil' bitch, yeah
She be my favorite
All my songs, they all on her playlists
I don't really know how to say it but I'mma say it
I don't really know if she take it but she could take it
I don't slow it down unless I'm in the matrix
Presidential brain that bitch like Sarah Palin
Here it go
I'm not the same nigga that I was a year ago
I thank God every day for this, a miracle
In the Trap House singing mingles, spirituals (yeah)
Aunt Jemima, best believe I'm in trap, goin' entry lining
Pull up on 'em with the Rollie, that's perfect timing
I guess that means that the stars aligning
Gonna sing like CeCe Winans
Changed shit just like the climate
Sit back in my seat reclining
I call that shit perfect timing
I'm in another country getting new money
My money like depression, yeah it's blue money
Feeling like I had depression, I was blue or something
Until I smoked a pack and then I blew or something
Listen to the way that, my flow on this shit is off the top, like a wave cap
Pull up on the ceiling you get knocked like the bass back
Put the Mac-11 bullet where your fucking face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And that's what a bitch put her face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And that's what a bitch put her face at




 [Intro]
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)
Uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 1]
I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs

[Bridge]
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 2]
I told her, "Run around and get away"
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feels like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossing me around but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was starting to feel cornered
Starting to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Starting to feel cornered, starting to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screaming out "Why bother?"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle

[Chorus]
I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

Pull up on a nigga from the back seat
Turn this fuckin' party to a track meet

Catch a opp gun him down, hundred rounds, fifty rounds
Make a move out of town, I was broke, but I'm up now
Bad bitches wanna fuck now, in the trap with my guns out
Niggas fu, baby, I got bills to pay
Bitch, get on your knees, bust all on her face

R Kelly with funds, boy, you pissed off
So get pissed on, ballin' out like a '89 Piston

Party with her friends, party with her friends
Overdose and drive, Imma crash the Benz
First class body, no commercial
Coke bottle body [?]
Party never ends, party never ends
Even at her end, party never ends

[Verse 1]
I put that Gucci in her casket, at her funeral
Broke her heart so bad, yeah she had to go, oh
And you know it’s not my first, yeah

Yeah, I had to grab the wheel, had to take control, oh
Cause she know I love to crash
Every heartbreak worse than the last

[Chorus x2]
Yeah, the party’s over
But it never ends
She coming over
I do her in

Say that again
I say it’s over
Say that again

[Verse 2]
I know that you’re scared Imma hurt you
If I was loving me I would be scared too
You know how it ends, you know how it ends
Breaking all these hearts, yeah it never ends
Time after time Imma leave you
Now you think that I’m evil
Coming to an end, coming to an end
Go and tell your friends, go and tell your friends

[Hook]
I put Versace in her casket, at her funeral
Broke her heart so bad yeah she had to go, oh
And you know that’s like my third, hey
Breaking hearts is a curse, yeah

I let go of the wheel then I lose control, oh
Cause you know I love to crash
Every heartbreak worse than the last

 [Hook]
Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place

[Verse 1]
Lost in a dark place
Trapped in the crawl space
In my mind I get lost in
I wake up in a coffin
They tell me they care
They're just in love with the music
So they'll never know
About the pain I go through
It's like a chain of reactions
All these demon attacks
From all the drugs that I'm taking
To the women distracting me
From being myself
It's like I'm losing my traction
Kiss death on the lips
I have a fatal attraction

[Verse 2]
This is my heart
Watch as my problems inspire me
Tear me apart
Won't let the demons take over me
They took it too far
Now I need some surgery
I'm falling apart

[Verse 3]
It's like I'm lost in the motions
Use this song as a rope
To wrap around the commotion
Tie the knot at my throat
I look at death as an ocean
I don't want it no more
But it's too late to reverse it
As I fall on the floor

[Hook]
Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place
Demons inspire me
Floor

Let me tell you about a girl that I know
Her name holds too many titles
Let me tell you about a girl that I know
Her name holds too many titles
Sadness, Oppression, Anger, Aggression

[Producer Tag] D-D-Danny Wolf

[Chorus]
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why

[Verse: 1]
Yeah, yeah
She whispers that in my ear
She made it crystal clear
That there ain't no love over here, here, here
Yeah, yeah
Told her put her hands in the air
She move a little too much for me
I'm scared that she ain't gon love me
I'm scared that she ain't gon fuck with me, abundantly
She'll get sick of me, a month of me
Now I rot my brains in agony
Smoke a half a P, that's a blunt to me

Please don't go there

[Chorus]
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm

Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for us

[Verse: 2]
Ooh, ooh
Bites to her neck, get her in the mood
She gon' act like Satan in those Jimmy Choo's
WW, I can never lose
But when you split the W in half, you get two L's
One way ticket straight to hell
Smoke my demons, I inhale
When I'm in hell
Ooh, ooh
This is the end of my song
Know I got a hand over my soul
I won't let her go

[Chorus]
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Freezing in my agony, but shit is getting warm
She took me to hell, I ask her why
She say because
Love ain't meant for demons, baby
Love ain't meant for us

Don't need a rifle
Everyone suicidal

Oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow
Tear me apart
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow, borrow, oh

[Verse]
Time after time they let me drown in my sorrow
I went through the night, I only wish for tomorrow
Love, love, love, got me walking in circles
Something isn't right

Ain't no you and I
Walking in circles
Something isn't right

[Chorus]
And I'm in denial
I don't need a rifle
Everyone suicidal
Imma burn a bridge
Feel like a pyro

Tear me apart
Does someone have a heart
That I can borrow, borrow, borrow

She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She was like the girls from the movies
Everybody saying she gon' use me
She really had me looking like a fool, who am I fooling?
She was way more than a groupie
Pretty like a fresh pair of Gucci
She give me brain and she smoke on them loosies, so loosely
I told her nothing ever really moves me
So I don't know why she got me up in my feelings
And I don't know if it's agony that I'm feeling
But I'm feeling

[Verse 2]
As the liquor kicks in, she's swimming through my head
Her hands in my dreads, yeah

Watch as she goes, as I come too close
To my overdose, she won't hold me close
If she does the most, yeah I mean the most of the pills
And the Henny, I ain't living on my own

[Bridge]
Na na na na, na na na na

 [Chorus]
I've been to three cities in the last two weeks
I fucked a few hoes that I met on the internet
They tried to impress me with the Gucci shoes
Bitch I ain't really into that
Hotel room start to look like a runway
Save no hoe Friday, fuck a Sunday
I know, I know she wants me for my clothes my Dior lookin' lovely

[Verse]
Four white hoes in the back of the Humvee
Knives to the back all these hoes wanna cut me
All girls are the same, pretty hoes still ugly
No good for me, no good for me
In the last three weeks, I've been to three cities tryna find these freaks, I know
It's wrong and heartbreak is real, but so are the pills
So I cannot feel whole
No good for me, no good for me
No good for me, no good, no good
They adore me, but they don't love me
They adore me, but they don't love me
She rock Off-White, straight from the source
Clothes brand new, you ain't seen them before
She know I got the juice, 2Pac Shakur
Lean got her passed out on the floor
I need some more
I'm getting bored of the same old drugs and the same old hoes
I need something for my nose

(No good for me, no good
No good for me, no good)

[Chorus]
Been to three cities in the last three weeks
Fucked a few hoes that I met on the internet
Couple of these hoes tried to impress me
Got Gucci shoes, look bitch I ain't into that
My bedroom starting to look like a runway
Save no hoe Friday, fuck a Sunday
I know, I know she want me for my clothes my Dior lookin' lovely




 [Chorus]
Let my insecurities take over
Right now it's kinda hard to stay sober
Last thing I wanna hear is "it's over"
Love is deadly it's gon' put me in a coma
If I lose you, then I'm losing my composure
Got me flipping in my coffin, turnin' over
All this pain in my chest got my lungs hurt
She gon' stab me in my left side, heart burst

[Verse]
I'm so scared, I'm so so scared
That I cared, and you don't care
Momma always told me not to have any fears
But this shit is deadly like electric chairs
You told me you leavin', death to my ears
This shit ain't Houdini baby, don't disappear
Heart break and harmony, feel it in the air
Tell Cupid stick to his day job yeah
I passed out in the party, almost died right there
All the drug use starting to pay off, yeah
I don't work a job, but I lay off, yeah
The devil on my shoulder need to stay off, yeah

[Chorus]
Let my insecurities take over
Right now it's kinda hard to stay sober
Last thing I wanna hear is it's over
Love is deadly it's gon' put me in a coma
If I lose you, then I'm losing my composure
Got me flipping in my coffin, turnin' over
All this pain in my chest got my lungs hurt
She gon' stab me in my left side, heart burst




 [Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 1]
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, but so what?
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug can pour up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time, we tried to rob him
He lucky, bro, that we ain't fucking off him
I'm drinking, driving in the Bentley coupe
So it's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, antihero
I burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of the throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of the throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

Past hoes, comin' back in the present (woah)
Past hoes, comin' back in the present

[Chorus]
She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been awhile since I been this gone
It's been awhile since she turned me on
Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been awhile since I sang this song
It's been awhile since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present

[Verse]
She don't love me, she say I'm a loser
How can I lose, when I fucked on my tutor
I told her to hold my Ruger
Cause when twelve comes, she'll be the loser
It's been awhile since I've seen your face
It's been awhile since I've been this wasted
Lookin' in the mirror and I'm startin' to see my enemy
It's been awhile since I've been this wrong
It's been awhile since you've turned me on
Liquor bringin' memories
Tryna fight the devil for some inner peace

[Chorus]
She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either

Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been awhile since I sang this song
It's been awhile since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present




 [Chorus]
It's the same old things
I say all the same things
In my mind, they're haunting
The darkness distracts me
Cause my heart is hurting
Heal it with the money
That don't mean a damn thing, that don't mean a damn thing

[Verse]
I'm fine, I lied
I'm doing all the best things, havin' the worst time
She'll leave soon, almost her time
And I was feelin' real love for the first time
Hate it when she gets like this
Ain't no gettin' to her, Ain't no gettin' through her
Lovin' her is a slit to the wrist
Sadness cutting through her, ain't no gettin' to her




 [Chorus]
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I was just smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I was just smokin' the flavor, you was just smokin' on nun
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I just been smokin' on piss, you was just smokin on bum
I just been smokin the flavor, you ain't been smokin' on nun

Came in this bitch with a couple of shooters, you with niggas beefin' over computers
Baby I'm tellin' you, your man a loser
Come this way, I know you be choosin'
Come this way, I know he gon' lose you
Pop Champaigne, and do Codeine, sometimes cocaine
On the way to the bank
You the, You the best that I ever had bitch, no Drake shit
I know I can get the pussy wet, no lake shit
Fuck all night, take percs by the cases
Get so high, I don't hear what she sayin
Somethin' 'boutta moon sign, somethin' 'bout a leo
I'm thinkin' of a orgy, I'm thinkin of a trio
She'll only cheat on me if you speak creo
Lost in Miami, gotta find her like nemo
Old dude, probably put (?) on her
Not surprised
Hope she ain't try to put who on me
I'm not the guy
She don't know what I do with my dark R
It's when I'm higher

[Chorus]
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I was just smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I was just smokin' the flavor, you was just smokin' on nun
I'm finna pour up a four, you finna pour up a one
You finna pick up a fist, I'm finna pick up a gun
I just been smokin' on piss, you was just smokin' on bum
I just been smokin' the flavor, you ain't been smokin' on nun

I gave her my all, yeah, yeah
I showed her my flaws, yeah, yeah
Round of applause, you got me
But I still won, becuase you topped me in your back seat
In an all black cavalier, don't you remember, that December
Admit, lil bitch don't be scared
Don't you remember? You were my little sinner

[Chorus]
Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me

[Verse 2]
I gave her all of me
I gave her all of me, physically, spiritually, oh
Fake Spiritual hoe
I gave her all of me
Mentally leavin' me cold, takin' love from my soul
Love Respect, in that order, I gave her all of me
Even walked across the water, I gave her all of me
Hopped the fences, crossin' borders
I gave her all of me, literally all of me

[Chorus]
Met her in the Summer, later the fall of me
Yeah, such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, later the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
Cause I gave the bitch all of me

Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Up in school, the teachers said we will be in jail or dead
Now I make way more money then them
Hit up the plug, spend they rent, I bought a pint, red Hi-Tech

Pullin' up early to the cash, I won't be late

[Chorus]

Hung up on yo bitch, if she hit me back, tell her my phone died
Really I was talkin' to a bitch I met on the north side

And we live
And we recording
And there's lean on deck, y'know?
Purple Rain
Okay, so

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Verse 1]
But in the meantime, bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me
My lil' bro keep a .40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money to worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime, bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time, outta energy
My momma told me, "Stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me, I'ma be fine

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Verse 2]
They know my name, hoe away
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties, I got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating Ramen with a Glock .9
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she calling me her next guy

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine

And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey

Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not hidin'
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Oh, ooh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh

[Verse]
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the shrooms
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

[Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not hidin'
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Oh, ooh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh

Don't forget it, I ain't have love in a minute

[Hook]
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute

Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings

[Verse 1]
Hooked up with this bitch I met on twitter
She gon' need some love when I'm finished
She gon' need some drugs when I'm finished
Put that shit under the rug when I'm finished
She be tryna ball hard in the scrimmage
Then I tell you I don't care about practice
Run a full court press on a mattress
In the strip club, throwin' dubs, she hit back flips
Yeah I feel in love with a stripper (yeah, yeah, yeah)
In the bedroom, I'ma tip her
Fuck her off a xan, and forget her
Call the club up, tell her come and get her
Now I'm mixin' pills with the liqour
Prolly put a nigga down quicker
She don't wanna fuck, though she got a sister
I'ma hit that bitch up on twitter

[Hook]
I ain't have love in a minute
I've been on drugs for a minute
I ain't hit my plug in a minute

Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings

Lately I've been drownin' in my feelings

I hopped out my bag, bitch I'm in my bag
Revenge on my bag, get the last laugh
Choppa in my bag, like it's Afghan
I'm cranky as hell, I just took my last xan
That bitch eating white pills like she Pacman
High as fuck, swinging through them trees like I'm Tarzan
Bi as fuck, she gon' fuck on me then her best friend
Bruce Wayne, I'm in all black like I'm Batman

[Verse]
Hit the curb, put it in reverse, yeah I had to swerve
Fuckin' with my green, I'ma shoot
Feel like Larry Bird
I know that my fans are the youth, they feel every word
Feel like superman in the booth, going ham in the booth
R-E-V-E-N-G-E on my body
Bad bitch say she gon' ride like a Kawasaki
All this ice
Choppa hockey stick, but I ain't playing hockey
Feel like Stevie Wonder, right
I can't see nobody, right
In that ghost like Poltergeist
Way she ride this dick, she treat it like a motorbike
After I get my nut, I tell her that it's over right (Yeah It's over right)
Then I hit my plug for that lean, sip it over ice

[Chorus]
I hopped out my bag, bitch I'm in my bag
Revenge on my bag, get the last laugh
Choppa in my bag, like it's Afghan
I'm cranky as hell, I just took my last xan

Bi as fuck, she gon' fuck on me then her best friend

Got your bitch off Remy, Hen, and I'm with Juice, he hit her friend
Yeah I'ma hit her, then I'm gonna fuck her sister
Run up on me, get hit up
Choppa put you on the ground, can't get picked up
They find you out back of the woods if you think it's Swisha
My squad like a pack of wolves, he want beef get bit up
Choppa face the frame if he can't get the picture
She gon' give me brain 'cause she know I'm that nigga

Chain shit just like the climate
Sit back and my seat reclining
I call that shit prefect timing
Im in another country getting new money
My money got depression yeah its blue money
Feeling like I got depression I was blue or something
Until I smoked a pack then I blew or something
Listen to the way I flow off this shit is off the top like a wave cap
Pull up to the scene and u getting knocked like a base bat
Put the Mac 11 bullet where ya fuckin face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And thats where the bitch put her face at
Eating good cocaine on a placemat
And thats where the bitch put her face at

 Okey, let´s skate
Bad bitch finna to come my way
Going ninety when on the high way
Can´t go high without the high and

Everyday I wake up smoke another gram
I don´t give a fuck or another damn
I´m smoking the cush from the hoover damm
Imma let this bitches know who i am

I can makes hoes songs without messing up
Gotta fresh  up, feel like i´m next up
Bad little bitch in the car named Venessa
She´s a flexer and a sexter

Uh yeah!

Sex talk and finess her
Then this next yeah then this next yeah
Both legs from the way that shit work out
Shopping leaving niggas shaken like its twerk out

Tyson on me knocks his lights out
Like i said shawty trap trying diet now
Run up on me talking shit you wanna die now
Type off working kind off nine to five now

Switch the floor up drinking Henny with the lean until i throw up
Imma spent 2 k on a bottle of some Henny
I don´t even drink that heavy, what the fuck gotten into me

Towing on a semi
Harder way when i´m balling these niggas comparing me to Penny
Spend change, hell nah keep the pennies
Ballin hard fuck a jersey
Need a penny

Aye huh! Aye huh!

Caught a fat nigga lacking he was up att Dannys
He don´t wanna smoke but we got plenty
I´m on bullshit like Chicago, no benny

I´m in London give me jumping
Right up on me then i´m up in the forty
It ain´t nothing my niggas be making this money
No assumption i´m gonna fuck the banking
Until the horny bitch coming

Watch your nigga vomit
Like i said my mama really think that i´m the money
Mom let´s be honest there is money in my pocket
I feel like a angel with the devil on stop it

You don´t want no problems like Wayne said cool
Whats up going to a goblin
Whats a god without a goddess
So i need me a goddess
Fuck being humble shit i´m done being modest
No i´m playing all this shit a blessin
Catch your shopper in to your intestines
Mic check one, two testing
Pull up on the scene slim wrestling
Me in Westwood straight flexing
I just may drop a hundred on a necklace
I just may drop a hundred on my next bitch
Flexing on the ex bitch
I do that in private

Yes i´m for the violence i still want peace thought
Yes i got a girlfriend, these niggas do hoes
Pull up on the scene like case shit like judo
I´m the type hmm

[Verse]
On these beats, I feel like I'm a murderer
Who are these niggas? Who are y'all, have I heard of 'em?
Who am I? I'm a murderer, uh
Niggas always on a sneak diss murmuring, uh

Yo' bitch like a car, yeah, that bitch a whore, uh
A four-door, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Presidents like 'more, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pull up on the scene, that blood, you gon' wear it
Brains get the tearin', all that fallin', ballin'
Bron on the Lakers like spalding, damn
This is how I play
Me and G-Money gamblin' over 2K, that's 10K
Yo' advance, not 2K
Off the top with the freestyles no tupe
I kick push work in my city like Lupe
That bitch don't cross the street, yeah she go both ways
My choppa shoot 'em four times, that's foreplay
Make you ring like a single finger, no Beyoncé
Man, it's 3K for the wrist, André
Just to fly out a bitch from the islands, Bombay

Run up on me than that choppa gon' spray, dawg

Police come through, I'm out the trap, I hopped the fence, uh

World in my hands, I'ma mold it like Play-Doh
Full of shit, hell yeah, rich ass A-Hole
A-Hole on the a-list
Fuckin' all the bitches on the a-list that you ain't even see yet
I'm meeting in all the legends, that all these goofy ass peasants, didn't even get to meet yet
They askin' for features
I'm shittin' on my exes, these niggas and my teachers
You pull up that's okay
Remember in school when we caught yo' ass lackin' and we jumped you by the bleachers
That's a true ass story
Yeah, I got kicked out
Fuck the bitch in the porta potty, my dick out
I'm on the scene goin' crazy, runnin' sick routes
I had to bring that shit out, man
I'm exposin' these niggas
I don't take breaks from raps, no reloading, lil' nigga
My clip on infinity, shootin' up yo' lil vincinity
I get Duff Clinton, lil' money like my name Hillary
I feel like a pastor, the triple 9 is the ministry
Nigga they be pussy like a menstrual bleed

This song is literally my canvas, I can say whatever the fuck (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Drownin’ in the Hennessy
It feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me
They say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin’

Sometimes I like codeine
Sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies
Sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin’
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin’

[Verse: 1]
I’ma drink the whole damn fifth
Then I’ma fuck a bad ass bitch
Then I’ma take a few Xanax
So in the mornin’ I might forget
Now there’s some random bitch in my bed
But she says that she had a good time
Same girl keeps running through my head
I won’t let you get away this time
I gotta broke heart can you fix, mine
I gotta full cup come and sip, mine
I gotta new script come and flip, mine
I won’t let you get away this, time (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Drownin' in the Hennessy
It feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me

 [Chorus]
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming
Where you at, ayy
Run it back, bae
Get the sack, chase
This a drag, race
Where you at, ayy
Run it back, bae
Get the sack, chase
This a drag, race
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming

[Verse]
Listen up, hey
I was in the cut with the semi tucked
High as a bitch, I really feel like throwing up
Perkies more lean, we be pourin' up
10k for a show, or I ain't showin' up
I know life's a bitch, I'm really startin' to like her
Ain't tryin' to argue, I'm a lover, not a fighter
I keep it on me, I'm a shooter, not a fighter
I date the devil, she gon' set my heart on fire

[Chorus]
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money
So I don't care if she don't care, just keep them perkies coming
You unaware I got it on me, run up .40 drumming

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yesterday my mom found out I was a junkie
But she don't care, cause I'm over here gettin' all this money

Niggas sad and they feelings on they hate shit
I'm just sad in my feelings on my hurt shit
But fuck the pain I'ma kill it with the perc shit. (Hey)(ayy)

So it's worth it, it's worth it
I remember my momma thought I was a burden
Mom I'm sorry for the trouble since a [?]
I remember the stress I put you through, yeah, you deserve it
I remember when you was in the hospital

Get you a Goyard bag and I'ma buy you a matching burka
Promise when I owe you money

Got a brand new gun, it got a Major Lazer

In the Himalayas

[Chorus]
I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a lazer

Pussy so good, damn I had to save it, mmm
Just so my lil thot can eat her out later, mmm

[Verse]
Can't organize my thots, don't need no note paper
Off the dome shit, smoke creative, anyways
You late to the party, have you belated
And if you want smoke, leave you cremated anyday
Put the bullet holes, in his windshield
Even if I'm havin' a bad day, I win still
Wake up, pray to god
Even thought that I sin still
Devil weighin' on my shoulders, like an anvil
Perky got a nigga itchin' uhh, ant hill
Fuck that bitch, then put her on my ad libs
You happy fake, bitch I'm mad real
Make that choppa masturbate, like a porn film

I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a lazer
Ain't worried 'bout a god damn thing

 [Chorus]
I see eyes, in the hills

Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a Wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna live lavish
Live like every day my last, shit
She say she love my old tape
This is way better than my last shit
Get rich overnight, I can't exaggerate
I can't wait to move my momma in a better place
I took my women to L.A. to Californicate
We damn near arguin' every time that she go away
Plus these hoes wanna fuck on me
But I won't let em' fuck on me
I know these bitches be scandalous, I can't handle it
So I let my woman handle it, she gon' vandle it

[Chorus]
I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns

Need a wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish

[Bridge]
Every day, I'm slappin'
Keep a liquor bottle in my lap
And I keep a drug sack in my bag
Trap house in my bag

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns

-Intro-
Uyuşturucular beni terletiyor ama oda soğuyor
Omuzlarımdaki meleğe ve şeytana bakıyorum
Bu gece ölecek miyim? Bitecek mi?Bilmiyorum
Sıradaki kafamın güzelliği için aranıyorum
Kendim için bir kapanış arıyorum

-Nakarat-
Benimle beraber lean iç
Benimle beraber patla
Eğer; benimle sallanırsan, yükseleceksin
Benimle dumanlan, benimle iç
Mahvolmuş organlar ve kötü halde böbrekle

-Verse 1-
Eğer, gençken ölürsem ona söyle
Her gün daha da berbat oluyordum
Sonunda aşk ve uyuşturucular arasındaki farkı biliyorum
Kızım söyle bana gerçekten ayılmam gerekiyor mu?
Bu kurgu değil, tamamıyla gerçek
Bir doz kullanmayı sikeyim. Benim iki hapa ihtiyacım var
Bela için aranırdım ve biliyorum ki, bulacağım
Ring,ring kanalım arıyor, mükemmel zamanlama
Biliyorum, doğru davranmıyorum
Ama hatalı da değilim, hayır, değilim
Kızım ne zaman dumanlı olsam bundan nefret ettin
Ama bu benim ait olduğum şey

-Nakarat-
Benimle beraber lean iç
Benimle beraber patla
Eğer; benimle sallanırsan, yükseleceksin
Benimle dumanlan, benimle iç
Mahvolmuş organlar ve kötü halde böbrekle

-Verse 2-
Kırmızı gözler, Visine istemiyorum
Mustang'le bir kaza geçirdim, Saleen ile değil
Extacy'i seviyorum, Lean'i seviyorum
Sidiğimin temiz çıkıp çıkmadığını sorduklarında gülüyorum
Benimle dumanlan, benimle patla
Gucci dükkanında benimle alışverişe çık
Eğer; bir gün çok fazla kullanırsam,bana eşlik edecek misin?
Şu an bunu düşünmek bile istemiyorum
Yeni bir yüksekliğe yükselelim
Mantarları ve hapları aynı anda alalım
Sokak hayatından Hollywood maceralarına gittim
Çok fazla uyuşturucu aldım şu an kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum

-Nakarat-
Benimle beraber lean iç
Benimle beraber patla
Eğer; benimle sallanırsan, yükseleceksin
Benimle dumanlan, benimle iç
Mahvolmuş organla ve kötü halde böbrekle




 [Intro]
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)




 [Intro]
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]: Kalou
All my friends and all my bros they turned their back on me
When I'm winning they just come around and clap for me
They so bad for me, guarantee, they want me to die and bleed
She made me go cry and leave, now my demons flying free
Wanted me to lose but Kalou going up now (huh)
Might buy AF1's and put them on my bro now (huh)
Might go buy a rollie shit might be a bust down
Mind your business don't you come and poke your nose round
Cuz if you poke your nose, I'm playing ghost, I'm on a roll, I gotta go
But you can't climb up on this slope because the path is for the woke
My only true friend is the lord above, I pray he keep my family up and I don't fall to double cups, oh please don't tell me time is up

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)




 [Intro]
Drugs, oh
They need lighters up for this one, heh
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' at my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shorty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong (where I belong)

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys, yeah

Gucci store, come and shop with me-e-e
Overdose, would you drop for me-e-e?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get high, reach a new high
Take the pills and the shrooms at the same time
Went to Hollywood hills from the street life
Took too many drugs, I don't feel alright

[Chorus]
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh




 [Chorus]
Okay, okay, alright
I've been getting high all night
Went to LA and I took the wrong flight
Got high then I took the wrong ride
Balling but I feel like off sides
Smoking weed just to pass time
Can't live in the past time
Looking at the future on my own

[Verse 1]
I remember when I fell in love
Fell in love, and it blew up in my face, land mine
I remember doing hella xans, hella Percocets
Thinking I was finna pass time
I feel like I'm Tony Hawk, kick push, kick push
Yeah, I'm on my grind
They wanna see me on TV, yeah
Cause I be ballin' like it's Prime time
And my ex calls my phone
Every now and then she won't get a response
Cause it's money on my phone (cash on my phone)
Ballin hard in the Saint Laurent

[Hook]
Leave me alone
You know I'm gone, yeah you know I'm gone
Why you still on my phone
You know what I'm on, I'm on a money hunt, yeah

[Bridge]
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just need, I just need the money that's forever
You know what I'm on I'm on a money hunt, yeah
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just gotta keep the shit together
I just want the money that's forever
That's forever, that's forever, that's forever
You know what I'm on, I'm on a money hunt

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, alright
I've been getting high all night
Went to LA and I took the wrong flight
Got high then I took the wrong ride
Balling but I feel like off sides
Smoking weed just to pass time
Can't live in the past time
Looking at the future on my own

[Verse 2]
Looking in the future, all mine
Searching for the shit you can't find
She gone let me fuck I'm inside
Ain't run from nothing, no high
I ain't feeling low I'm too high
Bad bitch and she came from Dubai
Only took me two tries
(one two, one two)


[Outro]
Let me talk my shit
Let me spark my blunt
Let me pour my fifth
You can't talk like this
You can't walk like this
Now they're on my dick
Rose gold
My watch look like piss
Everybody loves Juice
Everybody hates Chris
Water on my wrist
Probably fucking your bitch
Silly rabbit tricks are for kids
Aye
Talk my, talk my
Talk my shit
Let me talk my shit
Let me talk my talk
Hey




 [Intro]
I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

[Verse 1]
What's the 27 Clu-u-u-ub?
We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia
So I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend
I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out
What the fuck is this 'bout?

[Interlude]
I'm tryna make it out
I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out
I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

[Verse 2]
My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to ten

But first there's a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn't cold, now i'm froze

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna drop another tear
Roll up face blunts to face the fear
I wanna drown in your love, I'm scared of the deep end
You met my mom and my friends, so I guess i'm to deep in
And I won't give up no no, but its takes two, it takes two, to tango
What am I to do, it seems I fell in love with you
Instincts telling me to move a little closer but i'm scared so

[Chorus]
Gotta pack my bags up and hit the road
I don't wanna be here anymore
I can't hold on, I gotta let go
But first there's a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn't cold, now im froze

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Gotta pack my bags and hit the road
I don't wanna be here anymore

But first theres a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn't cold, now i'm froze

 [Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I've been runnin' off on plugs, I need to rob another one
I've been rubbin' off on all these niggas, cause they steal the sauce
Fuck niggas and hatin' hoes, bitch I hate those
That lil bitch goes "hiss, hiss", she a snake hoe
Somethin' like a bad kid, I don't listen
Baby these not advils, these perscriptions
I just dropped a xan bar, in my Lipton
I'm livin' the sweet life, London Tipton

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
Damn hoe, damn hoe
You ain't no fair
Fast life, fast life, no slow here
Got a Columbian plug, she a coke head
Told her come and ride dick like Moped
Take off, then she take her shirt off
Start the car, then skrt off
Then she take her skirt off
I love poppin' pills, mix it with the Smirnoff
Told me when I get too high and throw up, that's a turn off
Light my demons on fire and pray to god they burn off
I ain't birdman baby, but I'm still Stunna
Drip or Drown with the sauce, like my name Gunna
I like percocets way more than Marijuanna

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I've been runnin' off on plugs, I need to rob another one
I've been rubbin' off on all these niggas, cause they steal the sauce
Fuck niggas and hatin' hoes, bitch I hate those
That lil bitch goes "hiss, hiss", she a snake hoe
Somethin' like a bad kid, I don't listen
Baby these not advils, these perscriptions
I just dropped a xan bar, in my Lipton
I'm livin' the sweet life, London Tipton

[Verse: Doobie Dalil]
Get it how you live then, fuck my enemies
I just put a pyramid, in my Hennessey
I'm in the streets, and if she got an ass I'm prolly in her cheeks
She like "I gave Doobie some pussy, he don't remember me" I never do
Slidin' in my DM, who the hell is you
Vibin in this bitch, I'm smokin stank and eatin' edibles
Fuck it if it do not benefit, or bring us revenue
50 on my glizzy, one up top how I prepare to shoot
Gang bitch, run off on the plug, it's the gang shit
It's like I don't even wipe my ass, how I stain shit
Fuck her rough, choke her while I slam it like I'm camb, bitch
And I swear I don't [?] my dick inside the same bitch

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I've been runnin' off on plugs, I need to rob another one
I've been rubbin' off on all these niggas, cause they steal the sauce
Fuck niggas and hatin' hoes, bitch I hate those
That lil bitch goes "hiss, hiss", she a snake hoe
Somethin' like a bad kid, I don't listen
Baby these not advils, these perscriptions
I just dropped a xan bar, in my Lipton
I'm livin' the sweet life, London Tipton

 [Intro]
Cardo got wings
Now we cookin' up, yeah
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone (yeah, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm on, so they textin' me
Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best thing
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's...

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

[Bridge]
What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

[Verse 2]
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be...

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

[Outro]
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her




 [Hook]
I don't wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose you
Turn into a swimming pool
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool, pool

[Verse]
Now I’m drowning, I am not aware of my surroundings
You used to make me feel perfect, and now I am a whole different person
I dont wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
I keep going down misery avenue, I keep driving down misery avenue
Don't know what to do
Love is such a war, Ima call a truce
Taking all my demons in this fucking booth
Ima just keep it bool, But I can’t keep my cool
Cause, yeah, I don't wanna lose
You keep me on my ps & qs, You keep me on my ps & qs
Life is a race and I’m in last place, everything turned gray
Shit is not straight, Shit is not ok
Your in my way, but you make my day
And I see the love fade, I see the love fade
I always throw shade, and it's coming your way
Cause it’s not ok, yeah it’s not ok, it’s not ok
Ima deal with it, life is hard to swallow take a pill with it
Looking for a new girl to have now, who gon hold me down
I said I’m Looking for a new girl to have now, who gon hold me down
In the studio, hit it twice to go girl feel like coolio
That's yo ex cool, that's my newest ho
Fuck one I need two of those

[Hook]
I dont wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
I dont wanna fucking lose, Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool

[Outro]
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna lose

[Verse 1]
I ball on these hoes and I flex, did it on my own
I'm in the cut with a tec, this ain't what he want
She just want the diamonds on my neck, she gon catch a cold
I just fell in love with her neck, I can't let her go
I can't let her go
'member when I met her in the trap, she was scraping bowls
Whipping work, running from the cops, she was hitting curbs
In the car, singing all my songs, she knew all the words

[Chorus]
Then I lost her
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her
Even tho I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah

Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her
Even tho I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her

[Verse 2]
Give me head in my joggers
You thought these were Nikes? Sorry these Balenciagas
They thought I was the devil because I had all the Prada
Keep the heavy metal in my skin, these like a rocker
9 9 9, fuck em all, that's the motto (hey!)
If you end up power, fill em up with hollows
I sip Hennessy, won't catch me popping bottles (ay)
Up in VIP seducing all the models, ayy
Don't blink, put the Raf Simons on to complement the Mink
There's a room full of hoes getting wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V (yeah, ay)
Told her don't blink, got the Raf Simon pants complement the Mink
There's a room full of hoes getting wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V
So I lost her

[Chorus]
W-Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her
Even tho I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her
Even tho I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I just lost her, just lost her

[Verse 3]
I just lost her
Fucked her for the minute even tho I didn't want her
I grew up with them niggas that was serving on the corner
I was on my trap phone taking all the orders
When I lost her (when I lost her)
W-Woah, I just lost her
Wo-Woah, I just lost her




 [Hook]
You've been on my mind, since we first met
I've been gettin' high, it's a process
Heartbreak girl, we beyond that
Just be honest
The sorrow and the pain, I can't digest
Take my time, got no time left
Take my heart, all of my love
Just don't waste it
I was always scared to go find love
Waiting on cupid, to find us
But I'm on life in the hourglass, time up

[Verse]
I just caught feelings for styrofoam cup
Lean put me down, but it's fillin' me up
Fallin' to the ground, shit is tearin' me up
I'm fucked up
I try to pretend I don't care so much
When I wake up, and I see that you're gone
Got me doin' drugs, walkin' into my room
Dear lost love, Dear lost love, Dear lost love
Got me doin' drugs, walkin' into my room
Dear lost love, Lost love




 [Chorus]
Feel like I ran out of peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
Burnin' up 500 degrees, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
I ran out of the peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah

[Verse]
She makes it cold, without no snow
Girl I know you came a little to close
To take my soul away from me
You pray on love, and play for keeps
Girl you gon' regret the day you let go
Hunnid racks on the floor, nowadays there's more for me
I ball so hard, think I need a trophy
Watch her block my shot, hoe you not a goaly
Heard she love my style
Take a number, sit in line, wait awhile (hey)
I heard that she love me cause I'm wild (hey)
Ballin' think I need a timeout, get a triple-double now I'm out

[Chorus]
Feel like I ran out of peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
Burnin' up 500 degrees, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
I ran out of the peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Feel like I ran out of peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
Burnin' up 500 degrees, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah
I ran out of the peace, yeah
I don't know what's happenin' to me, yeah
I always thought to love them and leave them
I always thought to love them and leave them, yeah




 [Chorus]
The Asylum
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes
Oh no, I can't love no hoe, that's a no go
She only came for the promo
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes, oh no
One thing I know that's for sure though
You can't love no hoe, no

[Verse]
You're damn right, you're damn right I know
You're damn right, you're damn right I'm lovin' no hoe
At least not anymore
It's alright, I know my heart broke
It's alright, I don't give a fuck no more
It's all about the dough
It's all about the dough, yeah I know
I'm fuckin' on your hoe
You should know, she's not as loyal as you think so
It's time to leave her and get a new hoe
I'm done with one girl, I fuck with two hoes
I hit the party and get a few more
I'm fresh to death, this Gucci my funeral
I'm fresh to death, this Louis my funeral
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
She tells me love is breaking bad, no crystal meth
She said this shit is suicide, don't kill yourself
Just treat it like a broken glass, just build yourself
It's alright, I know my heart broke
It's alright, I don't give a fuck no more
It's all about the dough

[Chorus]
The Asylum
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes
Oh no, I can't love no hoe, that's a no go
She only came for the promo
Oh no, oh no, niggas beefin' over hoes
One thing I know that's for sure though
You can't love no hoe, no, no, no




 [Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're awake
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Verse 1]
For your love, workin' all day, fuck a off day
You lookin' cute in your Bape shit baby, you could go Ape
All of these other bitches are [?]
I am in love with a beautiful lady, she's in my brain
Star you set my heart on fire, 420 blaze
Yeah, no cliche, I can't explain
I got your name, tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen Titan, got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent if she kiss me, it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me, be there in no time
She's all right, so I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave her my heart, I'm willin' to learn
And it changed my life, I'm tryna get close with the stars tonight

[Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're awake
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're awake
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I wanted to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were...
...instead of my head
You found another...
...better one
I won't let you forget me

Sometimes I get lost still in my head
I'm so in love with that girl
I got the juice in this world
She don’t believe in loyalty, but want diamonds and pearls
Fuck that I had to man up
Tried to bruise my-

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)

Juice

[Chorus]
You still at the bottom
I’m still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look in the past and just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin’ anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow

They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

[Verse 1]
Fuck everybody they hate me
Hold hands and jump off of that fucking cliff
Imma start off by answering unanswered questions
The answer is no you can’t fuck with this
But you don't have to
Lets cut to the chase I'm a god of a rapper
And when I say cut to the chase
I mean run off and hope I don't stab you
Hope I don't have to
Fuckin' attack you
Spittin' more ink than a mafuckin tattoo
Bitch I'm not bashful
Bitch I will bash you
You just a sack to my tackle
I'm just a rapper with weapons
Wrappin' this rap up in raps
So I guess I'm just wrappin' it up
Life is a drug so I trip like a Klutz
To the point where I'm really not giving a fuck
I think that I'm crazy
Fuck it I know that I lost it
Ain't using my brain so I might as well toss it
If you don't like me then jump in a coffin
I bet you're exhausted
Poke out your eyes so you can't see me flossin
And cut off your tongue so I can't hear you talkin'
Cut off your ears so you can't hear me yappin'
I ain't mean to wake yo ass up with my rappin'

[Chorus]
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom

But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess we just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it
But if you gone' keep it I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game
Well if that is the case then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

[Verse 2]
Im up with the rockets
Im so outta pocket
I take off I'm out of this atmosphere
I'm so out of this world
I'm so out of my mind
I'm so out of my place
I'm so out of here
Please get out of my way before I go insane
And then put yo ass out of your misery
All these niggas say that I'm so out of it
Well I guess I don't know whats gotten into me
I'm just cruisin' and coolin'
I vibe to survive and I hope you pick up on my energy
Catch his ass while he snoozin' that's straight homicide
If you ever try takin' some shit to me
Swear the girl is the love of my life
It's a cheating if I say that life is a bitch to me
And I mean if I tell you to go straight to hell
And that you niggas do not mean shit to me

[Chorus]
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom
Might happen tomorrow
Just hold on I know we gone' make it there
We could look at the past or just drop it

They say life is a game

From your eyes

 Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave me
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left
You're my everything

[Verse]
It's funny when they tell me I'm a sad boy
Bitch, what you think I'm using all the drugs for?
Wreck the Benz truck while listenin' to Benz Truck, huh
I won't be sad no more
Somewhere down the line I met a sad girl
Next thing you know, she in my bed
Next thing you know, she in my world
Next thing you know, she in my head

[Bridge]
Let's add a little drama to the scene
This is where I tell you that I love you when you leave
This is where you tell me that I don't mean anything
Then that's where I tell you that you are my everything

[Chorus]
I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave me
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left
You're my everything

I should of took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song, oh

[Verse 1]
She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much, you're high, the sum up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you round momma
But you let me down, yeah you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you round momma
But you let me down, yeah you let me drown in drama

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh

I should of took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song, oh

[Bridge]
She told me thats it's all my fault

[Chorus]

 [Chorus]
I'm too much to grasp
You know you won't get me

[Verse 1]
I told my ex to die slow she can
My other ex could race her to hell and
I'll go through hell just to get a benz
Free all my niggas locked up in jail and
I will never love a hoe again
I get the girl I want and she loves me
My ex told me we should try again
I said I'll break your heart like you did me
I hope your boyfriends fucks and you miss me
I hope you say my name when he's hitting
I hope you think of me when you're kissing
I hope you call I'll decline I'm busy
I keep on balling Kobe I'm swishing
You must be having an off game you're missing
You got no money, that chump change you're getting
My Rollie cost the crib that you're renting
Ah, you got no money, that chump change you're gettin
My Rollie cost the crib that you're renting

[Chorus]
I'm too much to grasp
You know you won't get me

You know you won't get me
You want my cash
You gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams
She with me
I told my ex to die slow
Don't miss me

[Verse 2]
I told my ex I'll see her in hell
Matter of fact I don't wanna go there
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Lets go to London I gotta show there
Forgive the past I left all my hoes there
We're moving fast there no moving slow here
Girl if we crash atleast it was worth it
I'll make it last you'll make me feel perfect

[Outro]
I want to be held close
I feel distant
I feel all alone
I said I want to be held close
I feel distant
I feel all alone (all alone)
To be held close
I feel distant
All alone (all alone)

But that's what I get for talking to the pills, no benefits




 [Intro]
I can't take no chances, no chances
Lookin' at the, yuh, yuh

[Chorus]
I can't take no chances, no chances
Lookin' at the devil face to face, while she dancin'
I feel like a rebel, Marilyn, no Manson
She takin' advantage, she take me for granted
Heartbreak boolin' in my lungs, like cancer
Everybody playin' love games, it's a standard
I'm so pissed off, I feel like Bruce Banner
I forgot to show you to the door, mind my manners

[Verse]
I can do this on my own, fuck your help
I took my heart out my chest, and put it on my shelf
I told myself I wouldn't fall in love with anybody else
Next thing you know I'm on a dinner date, straight to hell
Funny thing is this not my first time here
I've been here so much, I'm really startin' to like hell
Toxic relationships got me killin' myself
On the phone with a therapist, bitch I need me some help
Shorty really got the key to my soul
Shorty play me like piana maestro
I was taught to let live and let go
I don't trust you, they gon' shoot you, they treat me like Metro
Cannon on my hip, like Metroid
Cupid wanna shoot, I'ma shoot back boy
Spinnin' Bobby Brown, that's the new crack boy
I'ma play this shit like a black JAG, boy

[Chorus]
I can't take no chances, no chances
Lookin' at the devil face to face, while she dancin'
I feel like a rebel, Marilyn, no Manson
She takin' advantage, she take me for granted
Heartbreak boolin' in my lungs, like cancer
Everybody playin' love games, it's a standard
I'm so pissed off, I feel like Bruce Banner
I forgot to show you to the door, mind my manners




 [Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Percy got me stumblin'
[?]
Old niggas mad sayin' that we mumblin'
Get the fuck up out my face
I'm just tryna get to the cake
I'm in the crib with a pole, fuck that

Fake love, fake love, and I love they hate
These niggas ain't real, I know they fake
Better watch yo step, better stay in yo place

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty]
Sorry
I been drippin' so hard as of lately
If I ever go broke [?]
Chasing
Just a young shot caller, blunt blazing
She ask me if I'm high, bitch I'm blessed
Fuck her 'til her eyes roll back, she posessed
Makin' bad money like I'm selling crystal meth
Baby girl was black and white, like a shirt [?]
Let me put my hands [?]
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, you'll get obsessed
I'm young, but I'm ready
Dancin' like DeeDee
Gettin' served like spaghetti
And my bro Corvette is no [?]
Sharp like machetes
I just want the Nike

[Verse]
I fly high, on planes
Crash down, but I am not afraid
Lost in life, like a maze
I'm so high, I'm amazed
That you were still walkin' through my brain
Killing me and driving me insane
I don't know why you won't go away
You're just another problem that I face
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
You've been away for such a long time
Keep tellin' myself that it's alright
Keep tellin' myself, but it's all lies
Keep tellin' myself that it's alright
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my

[Hook]
I know the secrets to you baby
You save the drugs, to drive me crazy
I don't believe a word you say
You're the one that's drivin' me insane
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day

[Outro]
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more drving me insane

No more, no more
No more, no more
No more driving me insane
No more xanny to the brain
No more driving me insane
No more, no more

What have I done
She don't even have a reason
Cold all four seasons
What have I done, what have I done

[Chorus]
She been poppin' pills, she don't even have a reason
Heart cold, all four seasons
Sayin' that she need me, molly in her Fiji
Now she throwin' up on my Yeezys, "Oh my god"
Lookin' at the damage, like what have I done
Lookin' at the damn bitch like what are you on
Why you look for love, when the love is all gone
(When the love is all gone)

[Verse: 1]
I guess I'm supposed to be sorry
But I can not apologize for nothing, hey
I'm too busy gettin' married to the money
And I'll be damned if I let a nigga take it from me, hey
Out my lane, out my way, out my face
Can't wait, I need cake, need it right now
Don't need love, it's gon' get in the way
All this talk about love, need to pipe down
So please get away, from me
Don't hope, don't wish, don't pray for me
Just be lucky that I let you lay with me
But now you tryna stay with me

[Chorus]
She been poppin' pills, she don't even have a reason
Heart cold, all four seasons

Lookin' at the damage, like what have I done
Lookin' at the damn bitch like what are you on
Why you look for love, when the love is all gone
(When the love is all gone)

[Verse: 2]
I ain't wanna do this, but I had to
I will never love you, I just wanna smash you
I don't wanna cuddle, kick you out the crib, I'll be glad too
But first, ride my dick like a saddle, Giddy up
Know you love it when I hit it deep, give you tummy tuck
Fuckin' till we go to sleep, and the sun is up
I ain't even gonna lie, got another one
And I ain't even gon' lie, that bitch prettier
So I, gotta let you go
I, never loved a hoe
Why, would I love a hoe
Why, I don't even know why
My hearts super cold (aye)
My hearts super froze (aye)
I can't love her no way
So I, gotta let you go
I, never loved a hoe
Why, would I love a hoe
Why, I don't even know why
My hearts super cold (aye)
My hearts super froze (aye)
I can't love her no way (I can't love her no way)
My hearts super froze, I can't love her no way
My hearts super cold, I can't love her no way

[Chorus]
She been poppin' pills, she don't even have a reason
Heart cold, all four seasons
Sayin' that she need me, molly in her Fiji
Now she throwin' up on my Yeezys, "Oh my god"

Medics in and out, tellin her breath in and out
Neighbors nosey then a bitch, askin me what this about
Shawty took too many drugs tryna overdose for clout

(Verse)
Molly on her tongue
Got her goin dumb

Presidential brain from your main Sarah Palin
Tryna judge a nigga you don’t even got a bae look

 [Chorus]
I've been feelin' needy, this love shit ain't easy
You've been all on my mind, I've been barely breathin'
Had a panic attack, I thought you were leavin'
And I thought you blocked me, text message turn green
Damnit, had to OD, tryna numb the pain
You was in my hotel room, finna run away
Prolly gonna slit my wrists if I don't see you every day
I think I'm obsessed, girl there's gotta be a better way

[Verse]
I'm willin' to die for this shit, suicide love
I'm to high for this shit, doin' my drugs
If you ever leave, they gon' find me in a pool of my blood
That should tell you how much I love ya
Would you ever die for this, my suicide love?
You're to high for this, she took all of my drugs
Now I'm in a trance, off the xans, tryna double my cup
So much for bein' sober
If we break up, that's a bad dream, I won't wake up from
Back to the sadness, and sleepin' by my lonesome
Wait, it feel like I'm bout to throw up
Sit down, stay awhile, girl don't say that it's over

[Chorus]
I've been feelin' needy, this love shit ain't easy
You've been all on my mind, I've been barely breathin'
Had a panic attack, I thought you were leavin'
And I thought you blocked me, text message turn green
Damnit, had to OD, tryna numb the pain
You was in my hotel room, finna run away
Prolly gonna slit my wrists if I don't see you every day
I think I'm obsessed, girl there's gotta be a better way

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've been feelin' needy, this love shit ain't easy

Damnit, had to OD, tryna numb the pain
You was in my hotel room, finna run away
Prolly gonna slit my wrists if I don't see you every day
I think I'm obsessed, girl there's gotta be a better way




 [Intro]
So alone
Count the money while my lonely
I ain't really fucking with the police
And you know I keep it on me
I ain't really fucking with the-
I ain't really fucking with the-

[Chorus]
She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Ginóbili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed
And she don't even know me

[Verse 1]
I've been balling while you sitting in the nose bleeds
911, I don't fuck with police
Niggas claim they know me when they don't know me
Say you a real nigga, better show me
I don't fuck with no one
Brother locked up, told you that's that Akon
I got AKs spilling like I'm Osam, aye
Pop a xan then I forgot, aye
I forgot to remember her name
Life is a picture I guess I got my hand in the frame
I forgot to remember her name
Life is a picture and I got all my hands in the frame

[Chorus]
She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Ginóbili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed
And she don't even know me

[Verse 2]
They sing the right songs they just hit the wrong notes
Remember old days when I had my heart broke
And now I'm in the stu and I love to spit dope
Brought brother in the trap and he love to fix dope
These niggas never change I could never fix broke
I run up on his ass, get the shooter Rambo
I know some niggas brazy, they run like elmo
I'm sticking to the money like I got velcro
You say you getting money but I know it's hell no
You don't got no Adidas but I give you shell toes
I'm balling like Shaquille Imma throw an elbow
You don't get no birds like a fucking scarecrow

[Chorus]
She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Ginóbili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed
And she don't even know me

[Outro]
I don't love the old me...
Balling like Kobe...
Ginóbili...

 [Hook]
I'm high, and I'm nauseous
Oops, I meant obnoxious

Runnin' outta options'
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes watchin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes watchin'
These niggas flockin'

[Verse 1]
I see fake shit almost every day
Choppa get the beats like Dr. Dre
Drunk off percocets, and alizé
I get high, so I feel numb, so it's okay
My problems is dead, but I just run away
Xanny my umbrella, for a rainy day
These niggas ain't straight, look like gay parade
Choppa got a gold tip like Flava Flav
Member I ain't had no gun, I used the razor blade
It was still a drill, when I came around, I feel like Major Pain
Prince up in that double cup, I been sippin' purple rain
I be throwin' hands and throwin' bands, never throwin' shade

[Hook]
These hoes watchin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes watchin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options, yuh, one take gang

[Verse 2]
Runnin' outta options, I was given too many
I save all my money, I'm not spendin' a penny
Boy I'm lyin', I just spent 2 thousand up in Supreme
Over shit I don't wear, I don't fuck with them jeans
I still bought em, cause I couldn't remember when I couldn't
Wish a nigga would, I never wish a nigga wouldn't
Run up on me, no he shouldn't
Oh no, no he shouldn't
Pull up on him with that choppa, like oh no he didn't
Pull up on him, with my room, you know that shit was missin'
UFC, he wanna fight, my fist put him in submission
I don't fuck with pussies, but I still beat up the kitten
He was totin' a Taurus, nigga I was totin' a smithon

[Hook]
Watchin', these hoes watchin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket
These hoes flockin'
These niggas flockin'
Runnin' outta options
Gettin' outta pocket

[Verse 3]
Freestyle the whole song, I don't even care
You unaware that your bitch over here in her underwear
That VVS on my wrist is lookin' like a Solar Flare
My choppa like a home run, get that nigga outta here
Goin', goin', gone
Transform to a car, like Megatron
Fuck yo bitch, I glow up in the dark, I feel like Tron
I choose you, she come and suck my ball like Pokemon
Call of Duty, with that choppa, watch how all my niggas spawn
Cal me Juice Osam, walkin' and I'm flyer than that bomb

[Outro]
Uh, huh
These hoes flockin'
Runnin' outta options




 [Intro]
Listen this shit really has me thinking man
Fuck, fuck

[Chorus]
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Cocaine all on the counter
Remember you in love with the powder
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still xanax all on the counter
Remember I'm in love with the downers

[Verse]
You can stay or you can leave
I just wanna lock you out and throw away the key
I just wanna lock you out and throw away the key
I just wanna lock you out
Hold on wait a second
You've been providing me depression
You've been abusing your position
Using your words as a weapon
You got me paranoid of other women
I'm knowing you got a ploy
You on a mission, you wanna see me destroyed
Oh no, you play with me like I'm a toy
Oh no, and I can't take it anymore
So you gotta leave
Now i gotta lock you out and throw away the key
Now i gotta lock you out and throw away the key
Now i gotta lock you out

[Chorus]
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still cocaine all on the counter
You got me in love with the powder
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still xanax all on the counter
Remember I'm in love with the downers
Downers, downers




 [Chorus]
40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin’ cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her

Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through

[Verse]
Your bitch is an Xbox, play her like game room
I was tweakin’ off the percs, mix it with the shrooms
Now I'm itchin' seein' shadows in my fuckin' room (lucid dreams)

Cute chocolate bitch, thats a fuckin' Reeses
Heard her nigga was talkin' shit, pull on him and crease him
Snort the molly off her tits, energy increasin'
Replenish me, prevent from finishing, when I beat, uh

Rollie on my wrist, did it for the season
Then I put a Patek on my wrist, for no fuckin’ reason
Automatic in my grip, got it for a reason
If a nigga try to take my shit, imma leave him bleedin’

[Chorus]
40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin’ cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her

Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through




 [Intro]
K. Swisha
Uh, uh, life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
You're not the boss of me now, you're not the boss of me now
You're not so big, yeah

[Chorus]
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear, don't be scared
Don't be scared, cause I'm here
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared

[Verse 1]
Can't nobody tell you how to love
Can't nobody tell you how to live life
Can't nobody tear me from the drugs
Can't nobody tell me what it feels like
I'm not the one to give advice
Social suicide, see you on the other side
If I speak my mind, they gon' have me crucified
Gonna crucify, baby, I'm ready to die
But even if I'm gone, I'm still here, so don't fear
My lost years are hidden in her tears, inspired by her fears

[Chorus] x2
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear, don't be scared
Don't be scared, cause I'm here
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared

[Verse 2]
I don't fear no one, paranoid, going in my gut (ayy)
To be honest, I feel like the one
I feel like the one, like the chosen one
You the silver one, I'm the golden one
This my own style, yeah, I be stealin' up
I love smoking gas, she be feelin' me up
When I fall on the ground, drugs be picking me up
Molly, holy ghost, gimme a holy ghost
I fuck another hoe, I fuck a couple of hoes
Cocaine overdose, she had a bunch of those

 [Intro]
Just wanna let you know I love you, but

[Chorus]
When you, put me down
So easily, I frown
Your words, they haunt my mind
But I'll lie and say I'm fine
When you, put me down
So easily, I frown
But I need you in my life
Our souls are intertwined

[Verse: 1]
Baby you know that you got a knife on your tongue
Cut away at everything that I bask in
Downplay my thoughts and all of my opinions
So much for being repetitive
You say the perfect things, to make me feel like
I'm not enough for you
It kinda sucks cause, I am in love with you
You make me feel so damn uncomfortable to tell you how I feel
But I want this for real
Not a faker
Kinda scared to tame my problems, you seem abrasive
Run away from all of the drama, I've been evasive
Still thinkin' bout it on a daily basis




 (Intro)
I don't want to go there, with her
That lil bitch a no good woman
I'm calling it quits, I guess I'm a quitter
That lil bitch a no good woman
I don't want to go there, with her
That lil bitch a no good woman
I'm calling it quits, I guess I'm a quitter

(Verse)
I guess I'm a quitter, had to lose you so I could become a winner
Never been god so no I'm not a forgiver
I'm a grown lil man, could fuck on a baby sitter
Life's not fair like Malcolm in the Middle
Oh these bitches really tweakin, skeet and I delete em'
I drink lean by the liter, codeine fever
I got stripes like a tiger but I'm still a cheetah
She don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with me either




 [Chorus]
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Red light, yellow light, Go!
Red light, yellow light, Go
Red light, yellow light, Go
Everybody push to start their engines

[Verse 1]
Caught him at the red light, had to leave him dead right
Shoot him in the head, right
We don't aim for legs, right
Ride around your hood, like my name was lil Red Ride
Out of soda, I've been pourin' up the red wine
Doctor told me that it's supposed to help unwind
Takin' them xannies, I'ma fuck around and stop time
[?] I was poppin' pills in the lunch line

[Chorus]
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Red light, yellow light, Go!
Red light, yellow light, Go
Red light, yellow light, Go
Everybody push to start their engines

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Red light, yellow light, Go!
Red light, yellow light, Go
Red light, yellow light, Go
Everybody push to start their engines

 [Intro]
Daytrip took it to ten
Fine

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Verse 1]
I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the percys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing little bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the worst
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

[Outro]

 [Intro]
Man, what?
This shit is funny
I was like, this hennessy strong as fuck boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag
And nobody gets hurt
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast
So I'm making it worse
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person
It's a gift and a curse
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinking too much so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said you love me first
One thing my dad told me was "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is "Flex on a hoe every time you're insecure"
I guess you came through
I'm running from you
Is your love for real?
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag
And nobody gets hurt
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast
So I'm making it worse
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person
It's a gift and a curse
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the run around
I really hate the run around
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag
And nobody gets hurt
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast
So I'm making it worse
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person
It's a gift and a curse
But I cannot reverse it




 [Intro]
Uh
I wanna tell y'all a story about this girl I met
I don't know if it was in person, or if it was in one of my dreams
But she'd have been a rockstar tonight
Enviyon on the mix

[Pre-Chorus]
Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
I'm racing her to hell
I don't really know her
Would I know her well enough, to know

[Chorus]
Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know her well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her heels (Louis V her heels)
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar forreal (she a rockstar forreal)
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know (enough to know)

[Verse]
I don't really know her well but I know her
All she wanna do is live in the moment
Pick up the pills and mix up the potions
Get high forreal, she not with the posin'
All she ever wanna do is molly in the ocean
I met her in Hollywood and I knew she was poison
She told me take two of these and call her in the morning
I ain't been the same since
I know when you take that road you can't go back, ooh
My heart cold and she know that too
Play your role, and I'll play my games
We could role that dice, but know I won't lose
No I won't lose, you could pick and choose
It don't matter what I do, I just wanna be a rockstar like you

[Chorus]
Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know her well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her heels (Louis V her heels)
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar forreal (rockstar forreal)
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know (enough to know)

[Outro]
I don't really know her well, but I know her




 [Chorus]
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get em up
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, run em up

[Verse: 1]
No more Xannies, gave em up
Last time I xannied, I threw up
In her panties, tear it up
She love all my Givenchy, she wear it up
She still running, from my love
Got the demons on me, I'm below high
And I'm done running, from the drugs
But they still running, from my gun, right
Club life, drug life, saw her in the club light
She a killer in the white shirt, that's that off white
How you finna ball on my turf, that shit offsides
She told me that if I took the right drugs, then I won't die

[Chorus]
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get em up
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, run em up

[Verse: 2]
I get money in my lone time, on my own time
I just popped a perc, and called a play so I'll be fine
Don't believe in sunshine, I'm a night guy
I lied when I told her I was Mr. Nice guy
Rockstar status, in the cut, with some Molly missin'
And you know that they dirty dancin' for the dope
She said she gon' suck me up until the bitch choke
Bitch I'm Danny Phantom, with the ghost
Pull up in a Phantom, like a ghost, right
Young rich, handsome, did the most, huh
Pop it like Champaigne, she tryna have a toast, right

[Chorus]
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get em up
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, run em up

El diablo en mi hombro me dice que voy a morir joven
Realmente no quiero que esto te impacte
Pero no lo sé, quizás sólo estoy siendo paranoico
Sólo quiero lo mejor para tí, sólo quiero lo que me queda de tí Oh..
¿me dirás que estás triste por dentro?
Estoy triste porque no te puedo satisfacer, si, rezo por hacerlo bien esta vez
Tal vez estaremos bien

I never been scared
I tell you that I don't care
Really I do care
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)
I never been scared to love (Drop dat bomboclat!)

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 1]
You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
No, I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 2]
We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough




 [Intro]
Disco, uh huh, yeah
I go so, hard, god damn

[Hook: Juice Wrld]
I go so hard, I go so hard
I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk
We don't say shit at all we don't like that shit talk
Ain't no off days at all but we get them bricks off
I sip Wockhardt with the moonrock
In that Bentley truck, yes I feel exotic
Your shit ain't there yet, put some drip on it
I'll take your whole check, and then I shit on it

[Verse 1: Juice Wrld]
Rollie white as fuck like I just put a brick on it
Your Rollie fake as fuck boy you can hear the tick on it
The way she sucked me up I thought it was a tick on me
I get the money than I split it with my big homies
You show your man off that nigga ain't got shit on me
My clothing like my state of mind, I got Revenge on me
F&N on me, that's a sick homie
Not big enough my shit will smoke you like a cig homie
I bought a couple Gucci coats cause it's a cold world
I dropped the pill in the lean watch it fizz on me
Ain't enough love for me in the whole world
My apologies, my heart be getting big on me

[Hook: Juice Wrld]
I go so hard, I go so hard
I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk

[Verse 2: Juice Wrld]
Sip so much everyone think I'm gon' die on em'
I put my heart into this shit like I just cried on it
My brother flippin' in his grave, there's niggas lyin' on him
His homies wasn't ever my homies
Niggas get to shootin' like they Prigioni
I get lean straight from Houston, that's the Whitney on me
You see that bag round my neck, that's the semi on me
If I got a backpack it's probably cause it's a titty on it
I spent ten-racks all on shoes, hella kicks on me
It make me feel some type of way, like my name Rich Homie
New Balenciaga's on me I bought two pairs
They ain't runners but you niggas know I'm still runnin'

[Hook: Juice Wrld]
I go so hard, I go so hard
I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk
We don't say shit at all we don't like that shit talk

In that Bentley truck, yes I feel exotic
Your shit ain't there yet, put some drip on it
I'll take your whole check, and then I shit on it




 [Hook/Chorus]
Shoot for love

Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love
Shoot for love (ohh, ohh, ohh)
Shoot for love

[Verse 1]
She an angel, she with the doves
I be high, I be off the drugs
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love?
Would you shoot for love?

Are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart on the rocks so don't run
I done put my name on a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Baby, are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart in this song so don't run
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love

[Bridge]
Run babe, go and hide babe, just don't fall in in love
Run babe, go hide babe, just don't fall for love, in love

Are you ready or not? Here I come

I done put my name on a bullet in my gun

Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love

 [Intro]
Southside on the track, yeah

[Chorus]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, that bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I been runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I been pourin' that Act’ up
Mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, the bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I'll be runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I'll be pourin' that Act’ up

[Verse 1]
She turned me to an activist, Actavis
She told me that she broke my heart on accident
We California-catin’, that’s my residence
I’m turning into Satan, kill the evidence
I fall in love easy, that shit evident
I’m takin' codeine with all my medicine
She doin’ morphine to numb the pain again
Feelin' like Prince with Purple Rain again

[Refrain]
I say the right things at the wrong times
Her head's fucked up, snort the wrong lines
Remember when you said you were all mine?
“All mine” turned to all lies (all lies)

[Chorus]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, that bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I been runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I been pourin' that Act’ up
Mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, the bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I'll be runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I'll be pourin' that Act’ up

[Verse 2]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need two cups
I get so damn high, I don’t feel much
I say, kids, do drugs, but don’t do too much
Last time I heard that I did too much
Too much isn’t enough, I’m not giving a fuck
I’m done believin’ in love, yeah I’m givin' it up
I fell in love with the lean, shit be slowin’ me up
But keep on pouring me up until the pain numbs
I’m popping perc-ys, until I throw up
You don’t know me, you may know of me
So what, I’m giving no fucks
Say you get real love
I say, “Bitch show me”

[Refrain]
I say the right things at the wrong times
Her head's fucked up, snort the wrong lines
Remember when you said you were all mine?
“All mine” turned to all lies (all lies)

[Chorus]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, that bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I been runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I been pourin' that Act’ up
Mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, the bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I'll be runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I'll be pourin' that Act’ up




 [Chorus]
I pop up like Slenderman
Gucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands
Scooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'
Who are you? We were never ever friends
Where I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land
Keep that cannon on my hip like Megaman
You either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan
I pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again
But as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win

[Verse 1]
Uhuh, yeah
Said that shit, I meant it
Uhuh, yeah
It's money over bitches
Uhuh, yeah
You niggas don't see the difference
That's why you broke and I'm rich
Because I see the difference
I spend 100k in a month, I don't got shit to show for it
But I ain't worried bout shit I know I could always make more
Racks came in, stretch it out the long way
Came a long way, from wearing Choos up in the hallways, yeah
I did it by myself, ain't had no company
Everybody get they hands out now, Fuck do you want from me?
You want the secret to my sauce, you a wannabe
You will never ever be a boss, employee

[Chorus]
I pop up like Slenderman
Gucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands
Scooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'
Who are you? We were never ever friends
Where I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land
Keep that cannon on my hip like Megaman
You either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan
I pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again
But as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I pop up like Slenderman
Gucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands
Scooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'
Who are you? We were never ever friends
Where I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land

You either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan
I pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again
But as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win

Aye, thanks, foe
You know what I'm sayin', foe, I say

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Backwood smoke make a nigga float (woo)
Good trash talk get a nigga smoked (woo)
I bought my first gun with an extendo (woo, yeah)
You'll be fucked up if I let it go (woo)
Yeah, I keep it tucked like a cell phone (woo), like a cell phone (woo)
Heard you need them bales, ho (woo), hit my cell phone (woo)
I'm too high to FaceTime (woo), fuck my cell phone (woo)
All I do is waste time (woo), on my cell phone (woo)

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Your bitch all on my line (woo), yeah, my cell phone (woo)
I travel through her mind (woo), via cell phone (woo)
Niggas threatenin' my life (woo), via cell phone (woo)
That ain't beef, ho (woo), you look like a vegan, ho (woo)
Fuck her, we don't speak no more
Don't go to church, can't preach no more
I put a ring around her throat
So that lil slut don't leave no more
I can't sip no lean no more
Still gon' sip some lean some more
Mix it with that Perky and that Henny
I'm unconscious

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Backwood smoke make a nigga float (woo)

[Verse 2: Valee]
I ride Forgiatos, them stop and gos
Hermès joggers, two thousand year olds
That ain't your two door, you got it off Turro
My latino bitch cook cinnamon churros
My marble floors glossy, it look like a mural
My spot automated, I talk to Alexa
Not really a foreign if it is a Lexus
Got a brunette, she go to Loyola
Toyota pickup, a Tacoma model
I one way to New York to rub on a model
I had a bitch spun like John Leguizamo
Got art on my wall, but not by Picasso
Two custom pieces I got from Art Basel
I travel, no luggage, I'm savin' the hassle
I eat at Spondivits, that shit like White Castle
Got rips in my Balmains, I lock up the racks in 'em

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Backwood smoke make a nigga float (woo)
Good trash talk get a nigga smoked (woo)

 [Chorus]
Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I might just go get some more, more

[Verse]
Say she want my heart, she can't afford it
Maybe cause I'm on my way to getting on the Forbes list
Pretty Jiggy nigga, can't ignore it
Ballin' bitch, I feel like Michael Jordan
Sip Codeine, I'm snorin
Til' the mornin'
Got the heater on my hip, like global warmin'
Run up you get shot, this is a warnin'
Freddy Kruger in your dreams, I'm filled with torment
She say that she love my bitch, whatever that means
I remember her and our friends were laughin' at me
Now they tell me I can fuck, that shit so funny to me
Lost 10 thousand playin' basketball, 100 to me

[Chorus]
Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I made you go get some more, more

Then I throw my dough up, because I want to

[Verse 1]
Gettin' to these commas, cause you know I want to
'Member when they hated on me in the lunch room
Now they on my phone and they wanna come through
Imma play these hoes like they in a game room
Looking at the world, like what has it come to
Looking at your girl, Imma make her cum too
I don't gotta chase, Imma make her run too
She ain't just for me, boy she for the whole crew, oh
Look at my shoes, hoe
Rick Owens too, gettin' my groove on
Fuckin' your new hoe
All in my room (? my new hoe)
Rick Owens too, gettin' my groove on
Fuckin' your new hoe

In this backup
Now she wanna act up
Tell her back up
He gon' need some backup
Get 'em back up
Waitin' for my moment and the time is right now
Presidential rally like I'm in the White House
I was in the trap cookin' Amy Whinehouse
All my niggas ballin', we shouldn't lie south
Don't try me, I got the pipe out
Lookin' like the winter time, I got the ice out
Don't try me, I got the pipe out
Lookin' like the winter time, I got my ice out
50K on shoes
Maison Margiela, when I'm ballin' I don't lose
Eeny meeny miny moe, these bitches finally shoosh
I finess the revenue

[Chorus x2]
Money come and go
Bitches come and go too
She was getting old

First I'll drop my hoe, then i drop my sunroof
Then I throw my dough up, because I want to

Had to cop me something new
Then I drop my sunroof
Because I want to




 Snippet

[Hook]
I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
Seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treat me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I'm getting tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

[Verse 1]
Die just, die just
This lil' heart of mine, I won't let you smash it
Burn me up inside, turn me into ashes
Why, why
This lil' soul of mine, won't let it get intertwined
With somebody I, always fail to realize that
They were never mine, they were never ever mine
I was just a part in her pics, they [?]
This lil' soul of mine, never let you get control of mine
Unless you control my mind, I gotta keep that mindset
This lil' soul of mine, never let you control mine
Well now you finna stay and work it out, not this time

[Hook]
You the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
Seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treat me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I'm getting tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you




 [Chorus]
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, got em' crip walk-ing
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
Stick talk let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, make him crip walk shit
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit

[Verse 1]
Mix it up with a little bit of that and a little bit of this
I told you baby I'm too high to take a pic
I understand you wanna vibe a little bit
But understand that I'm too high to give a shit
She told me I don't tell the truth I'm full of lies
I told her it's the ugly truth, don't be surprised
I told her I would only tell her one time
Now shut the fuck up and have a good time
When she walks in the room, you see Margiela on her shoes
But she's as shallow as a pool, so I don't know what to do at all

[Chorus]
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, got em' crip walk-ing
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
Stick talk let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest make him crip walk shit
I been getting high off the skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit

[Verse 2]
When I walk in the room, I'll be walking to my doom
So I'll have my hand on a tool
I know they want me to lose, and fall
Bitches come in twos, so I'll admit I fucked a few
But just a few will never do
If I fuck one I guess, I gotta smash em' all
Don't get it confused, I'm nothing like these other dudes
I treat hoes like Pikachus, I guess I gotta catch them all
I do what I wanna do, I know you're not amused
And I'm always on the move, I can teach you how to move
Got her wet like a kiddie pool, yeah she's a splasher
They know that I'm too ahead and they can't catch up
When I walk in the room, I'll be walking to my doom
But I got my hand on my tool
They won't catch me slipping at all

[Chorus]
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest, got em' crip walk-ing
I been getting high off the Skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit
Stick talk let the stick talk shit
Shots to the chest make him crip walk shit
I been getting high off the Skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the moonrock shit

Another love goes down the drain, where it belongs
Another love goes, where the drugs go

 [Intro]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
Tell me she don't love me, she don't feel me
Drownin' in my sorrows baby, 10 feet
I remember I was wearing 10 deep
Now I'm wearing Gucci to my track meets
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas catch me
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas pass me
But I catch a fuck nigga like a taxi
Leave a pussy nigga leakin', need a maxi

[Verse 1]
I'm so busy rolling off the molly
This is why I don't fuck with parties
My brother had to send up a party
Niggas in the A was tryna act gnarly
I'm a smoker, feel like Bob Marley
Run a train on your bitch, that's a trolly
Tony Hawk on my grind, no ollie
Self-destruct off the drugs, kamikaze
I don't think that anyone can stop me
You ain't police bitch, why you tryna cop me
I don't think that anyone can stop me
I'm not a beat bitch, you know you can't drop me

[Chorus]
Tell me she don't love me, she don't feel me
Drownin' in my sorrows baby, 10 feet
I remember I was wearing 10 deep
Now I'm wearing Gucci to my track meets
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas catch me
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas pass me
But I catch a fuck nigga like a taxi
Leave a pussy nigga leakin', need a maxi

[Verse 2]
I took too many drugs, 'bout to OD
I robbed too many plugs out the OG
I remember when we came up on 5 piece
I remember when we ran from the police
These niggas really thinking that they know me
Nigga you don't know me cause of IG
I can prolly fuck your bitch on the high key
I'ma keep her in check nigga, Nike
I done fell in love with the perkies
I'm on go, I'm on go, nigga flying
Run up on me, I'm strapped nigga dying
Traumatized, leave a fuck nigga crying

[Chorus]
Tell me she don't love me, she don't feel me
Drownin' in my sorrows baby, 10 feet
I remember I was wearing 10 deep
Now I'm wearing Gucci to my track meets
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas catch me
I'll be damned if these fuck niggas pass me
But I catch a fuck nigga like a taxi
Leave a pussy nigga leakin', need a maxi




 [Hook]
Back in this bitch
Smoking thrax in this bitch
Back in the day I was in the trap, moving packs in this bitch
Run up on me like a pimp, you get slapped in this bitch
40 like a bad hoe, on my lap in this bitch (huh)
Running too fast, that's a lap in this bitch (huh, yuh)
I go hard, cashin' n' shit
Pullin' up in an Aston n' shit
Wanna fight Chapo, left right left right like cashes n' shit
Cashin' n' shit

[Verse]
Cash out on a bitch
Damn right, I'ma hit
Damn right I make hits, I can't miss, I can't miss
Fuck your bitch in the kitchen
So everytime when she cooking you up grits, she reminiscing (you digg)
Damn I talk too much, I should really shut up
But I talk too much cause I'm a money maker
I say what I want, or don't say shit at all
Bitch, I shoot to kill
You shoot to make 'em fall
Bitch I feel like Vans, my shit be off the wall
Doing percocets while fuckin' with that adderrall
Bitch knock it off, come over here and top me off
And I can't gon' pick you up, but I'll drop you off




 [Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
When I saw her

[Chorus 1]
When I saw her
It was like a daydream, felt like yesterday
I won't love her
Love is such a sad thing, giggles in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a hundred miles away
I should call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait, me wait

[Verse 1]
Let's have dinner by the lake
You can meet me 45 past 8
You look beatiful today
But I guess it's everyday, okay
I don't wanna fall in love
But you makin' it too hard for me
I know I'm stuck in my ways
But you been stuck in my mind all day
You been stuck in my mind all day
You been stuck in my mind all day
All day

[Chorus 2]
When I saw her
It was like a daydream, I think I'm awake
I might love her
Love is such a new thing, giggles in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a million miles away
I'ma call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait

[Verse 2]
Let's take a walk across the beach
Let's go to my favorite place, LA
Don't know what's happenin' to me
I think I'm fallin' in love, no way
Girl, this gotta be a dream
Damn, I gotta stay awake, awake
Now I find it hard to breathe
Every time I see your face, your face

[Outro]
When I saw her
It was like a daydream, I know I'm awake
Yeah I love her
Lil' bitch such a strong thing, can't keep her away
I'm a stalker
I can hear her breathin' from a million miles away
I'ma call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please give me your time o' day




 [Chorus]
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (get off)
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (yeah)

[Verse 1]
That bitch in my head, parasite
Pull up in that ghost, Poltergeist
Triple 9 my shit, fuck the pastors wife
Pull up with the pipe, shoot em 40 times
He don't want no smoke, cancerous
Prolly smoke him like a cancer stick
Give me head, no psychiatrist
Pulled up with that choppa, let it hit
You a clown, you a clown, it
Playin' tag with that gun, you're it
Get the cash, fuck these hoes, that's it
Pockets fat, lookin like Norbit

[Chorus]
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (get off)
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now I got these labels on my dick, right
If it ain't 50 million, that shit hit, right
Cause every song I make, that shit a hit, right
And see every song I make, I get a bitch, right
I should count how many songs I have
Cause that's how many bitches that's gon' pull up and get smashed
See I'm gon' ball so hard, I feel like Kevin, no Durant
You know I'm doin' everything they said that I can't, I'm the man
Money in rubber bands, ran through 20 bands, that shit ain't even stand a chance
Keep a white mask, no Ku Klux Klan
Bet you never seen a drive by, in a Sprinter Van

[Chorus]
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (get off)
I don't got the time for a bitch (tick, tock)
I don't got a dime for a bitch (wrist watch)
Percocet I pop, make me itch (get off)
She was in my mind, like a tick (yeah)




 [Intro]
I mean, y'all be sayin' that y'all freestylin'
But y'all be like... spittin' writtens and shit
That's BS
I don't even write my wrongs

[Verse 1]
Off the top, kickin' it, no karate class
Janitor, I'll mop his ass up, chop his ass up
I'm the best at what I do, can't nobody do it better
Yo girl look like sprinkler system from the way I get her wetter
I'm out the jam like jelly
I'ma go hard, catch the shot like Belly
I'm the best to ever do it, have 'em leakin' body fluids
Feel like Waka Flocka "O Let's Do It" when I'm on this music
Off the dome when I'm kickin' it
Kinda like I got an impediment when I'm spittin' it
I been rippin' writtens without writing a damn thing
Doin' my damn thing, I rap and not sing
I ring like bells, king
That's me, you better king me
I'm married to the money, fuck it, need to buy a ring, b
I pull up on the scene, choppa get the fuckin' ring, king
Like a joke or something, choppa get the zine king
Man this shit look easy, on my grind like Trukfit, no Lil Weezy
Yo bitch too sleazy, 40 bless yous, sneezin'
I'm the best to ever do it, take yo breath away like not breathin'
Breaking Bad method how I sell this meth
Retrospect, put that shit back in retrospect
Take yo specs, take yo bitch, grab her breast, tat her chest
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that again
Lord forgive me on this mic, I know that I'm finna sin
Killin' him, him, and him, referencin' Eminem
All these other rappers ain't shit but just fillin' in
I don't really got time for it
They can have a penny cause I don't really have a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch
Comin' up the full court, pressed like Kobe or somethin'
Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me that's okay, that choppa on me get the Jumpman
Like Jumpman, 23 and that Glizzy come and get it
I been defyin' niggas like science and physics
Run up on me, I hit 'em, that choppa on me like a tongue
I pull it out and them lick 'em, I'ma shoot him till he done
I got all the girls sprung, pull up on the scene like "he hung"
I'm the best to ever do it, say that again
Off the dome, kickin' it, that's just how it is
I don't have to write shit, I see it like a psychic
Fuck yo girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah I said it and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, I get high in this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
I do that shit on purpose, suicide on that bitch
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche
We kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck yo bitch on camera and call that bitch a hardcore hard porn
Sharper than any hard poons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so they choppas actin' like brooms
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon
Pull up on the scene, that's just me
Hey, switch that shit up real quick
I may come back for that, I dunno

[Verse 2]
I was just talkin' about how I like Tyler in that coat
I'ma, I'ma fuckin' Dapper Dan in a pair of Gucci socks
Runnin' up on me you get popped
Catch the shot out the block, I'm the Juice, word to Pac
Run up on me, pop the top, matter of fact, better back up
Cause I'm in the back of the truck with the MAC tucked
Turn that nigga into a condiment or somethin', he need to catch up
He can't catch us, them niggas can't back us
Man, them niggas need some backup
I'm on the scene, boolin' with my bros
Like Drake with the 6, runnin' through it with my woes
Run up on me like Shaquille and the pain I'm throwin' balls
You a ballerina cause I keep you on your toes
Shout out to them Florida niggas, I know some zos
Run up, that's okay, I'm finna let the choppa blow
I'm on Westwood, ridin' through yo hood
Like Red Ridin', strikin' like bright lightnin', my flow is too excitin'
I'll end yo world like Mayans, off the dome, kickin' it
Try me if you think I'm lyin', now listen how I do it
I get brain from a smart bitch but she stupid
Put an arrow through yo heart but no, I'm not Cupid
Like you shuffle when I shoot, but no, it's not Cupid
The wordplay is so cold, my heart is so gone
Yo bitches so sprung, yeah I put the team on
She gon get the whole team head, call that a crew neck
But I'm wearin' a sweater, I'ma get her wetter
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that shit forever
No matter the weather, knock 'em out like Floyd Mayweather
I'm off the dome kickin' it, that's just how it is
I'm Khalifa with the reefer but I never been a wiz
Tricks are for grownups, they said they were for kids
Hell naw, cause you will get popped off like a zit
If you fuckin' with my money cause I'll all about a grip
Tell yo bitch to swallow kids and I'll tell you to swallow clips
Rest in piss, rest in this, matter of fact, I'ma go hard
Spit crack like Bobby Brown and grill 'em like Bogart
Stomp the yard like Chris Brown like he got shot in the movie
I'm hotter than white bitches chillin' in a jacuzzi
My money got longer, shout out to Uzi
I'm in the scene with a nina, you run up, I'm shootin'
I swear that you don't want no problems with me, it's over with
Call me everything but sober, I am not with that sober shit
It's a union with my gang, comin' round like it's Soviet
Matter of fact, I'm finna gamble for this shit with yo poker chips
If you run up, you will, you will get cranked like Soulja did
I'ma drop bars same way I drop bombs, you ain't on shit
WW-dot-com, I forgot a W, I took that out, that W stand for "Win"
And I never took the losin' route, I always took the losers out
Eeny meeny miney moe, I always pick the choosers out
She got titties, when she come around I pick the hooters out
Run up on me, that's okay, they beefin' with computers now
I'm not worried about these niggas, keep a thirty on my hip
I Steph Curry about these niggas
These niggas hella soft, man I worry about these niggas
I never run away, I don't flurry away from niggas
That nigga lil' pussy, he furry, ain't he, lil' nigga?
Pull up on the scene, you know I'm with it
My windows tinted, pulled up clean with a "Stop, you finished"
You know we did it
I'm ballin' like Dennis Rodman, I'm fuckin' awesome
My bombin' like atomic, my eyes are redder than demonic
I'm faster than sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses, I got it
Run up on me, I'm poppin'
Feel like Drake when I'm rappin' cause I start from the bottom
All this shit that I'm talkin', I could probably back it
I slide into yo bitch DM like a sled and toboggan
For yo brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' that target
I'll turn yo ass to a target then threw yo ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin'
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate", nah
I did this all by myself so I don't need nobody's help, shit
I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel
You can catch 20 shells, you a fat person, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, Seinfeld
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my 40, it came from my plaster
That shit is a blessing, I leave you in the past tense
I rap to wrappin' plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outta space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, yo bitch in my left hand
And her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it'll come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pant pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside the clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me cause it go, oof!
Next beat, next beat, I may come back
Next part, what should I kill? Cool

[Verse 3]
Catch me spittin' on this Kill beat
Hopin' that these niggas would just feel me, the real me
My weapon is concealed and
You know I'm a suspect when I walk into the building
I came to London just to make some noise
The shit I say is for grown men, these bars are not for lil boys
I'm Andy with these toys
You run up on me, you get flexed on like Terry Crews and steroids
Listen, I been ballin' like a Piston
I been marchin' on niggas like I am army enlisted
You run up on me, you get it
My choppa' retarded and spittin' on these goofy ass niggas
Pop a roofie, I'm gone, in a whole nother zone
Put my dick in yo mom, that's the shit that I'm on
Yeah that's the shit that I'm on, you ain't on shit cause you dumb
You run up on me, you gone, that choppa' on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo' dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me
Off the Xannies, I'm a zombie
Don't believe me, try me, fuck around, stomp you
I'm kinda hungry off the weed, I may chomp you
And that shorty, she a eater, she a muncher
Man I'm feeling like a monster
Straight Jeffrey Dahmer when I'm grippin' the Llama
You don't want problems, no smoke at all
I take your whole pound and smoke it all
I take yo bitches then fuck 'em all
They on my D, I'm hatin', I duck 'em all
And she look at my whole team then suck 'em all
Macaroni on me, it'll buck-buck 'em all
Man somebody tell me to stop, nah, I'mma keep goin', just watch
I take yo Rollie, yo watch, yo bitches all on my cock
You run up on me, get popped, they judge a nigga like Cochran
They forgot to stop it, run up on me here
I got a rocket on me, no launcher
I feel like I am the bestest, I'm deadlier than asbestos
My word is really my weapon, I'm coming back for some seconds
Freestylin's a preference, send you to stairway to heaven
Man, these niggas writin' the shit that I say
The beats beat when I'm beatin' like Doctor the Dre
I pull up on them with the choppa', and screamin' out "Hey!
Fuck you, pow pow, have a nice day"
And my wrist is like an ice tray, and yo bitch she do what I say
Yeah, she put her hands in the air when my song come on
Like single ladies and Beyonce, yeah
And the way that I spit shit
I burn niggas like Jamaicans with the incense
Been the realest with the shit ever since I was an infant
I'm a misfit, Tony Hawk on my grind like a trip tip, you could get hit
Choppa leave you cryin' like a chick flick, I'm a sick kid
Bitch, I been lit, man these niggas ain't shit but some pussies
And pork ass niggas, fuck is a piglet
Fuck is these niggas, I don't fuck with these niggas
A four-leaf clover on a bullet, good luck with these niggas
Man it must suck for these niggas, ol' sufferin' niggas
YouTube ol' video bufferin' niggas
Ol' big bad wolf huff-puffin' ass niggas
Til I pull up on the scene like "You think you hard?"
I put a bullet hole through your muffin ass, nigga
Man, all the songs that I'm bumpin', I got the partiers jumpin'
You run up on me, it's over, that chopper's on me, it's dumpin'
I'll dump you like a bad relationship, hold on, wait, wait, wait
Let me take this shit, it may take a bit
I spit the shit I say, go back, re-say it
Then say somethin' different, replacin' it, man they hatin' us
It's presidential brain from yo bitch Sarah Palin kid
Still sellin' John McCain, like you got yo shit snatched
My flow is off the chain, pull up in the rover, yeah I got the range
I feel like Drake, nothing was the same
Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion
I rush out with yo girl, she fuck for hours up in the shower
I feel like I got superpowers, I'm so superb
I'm bout the action, you niggas bout action verbs
I don't gotta say a word, I shoot for the grave, feelin' like Larry Bird
On the competition, I drop and take a turd
Shove it in they ears, they hearin' every word
Really though, I get it poppin' like a nigga hittin' Willy's hoe
Or an ollie hoe, or a molly hoe
Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley hoe
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf
You want to go to heaven so bad, here's a halo
My gun sing like J Lo, you better get low like limbo
Before you catch a couple shots for yo kinfolk
I'm Rambo with the ammo, I don't never let go
Money kinda stick to me, call me Juice Velcro
Say you gettin' money now, fuck nigga hell no
You don't like Adidas but this choppa give you shell toes
This choppa' give you shell toes
And leave yo ass dancin' on the floor like a red nose
Beam on my gun, that's a red nose
Pull up on the scene, let the shit blow
Yonkers, Yonkers, in this bitch with Westwood, man

Yeah, let's do it, oof, got a lil' more bounce to it, don't it?
Uhh uhh, I've been going through a lot as of lately

That's just how it is, boy

My flow so outdated, so old school
But then nigga switch it up to something so new
These niggas walking around like they bulletproof
'Til the bullets shoot, leave the bullets through his sunroof
Kill his son too
Give a fuck, ohh, give a fuck
Nah, not what I do
I'm the type to pull up on your youth group
With a choppa and a machete, that's fuckin' useful
Matter of fact, here it go

I'm spittin' miracles, I'm in that white whip
What you call that shit? A miracle
Fuck yo bitch from the back singing [?] spirituals
Got a seal, like fate, like a fuckin' envelope
I ain't dope, I'm anti-dope, word to Travis
You run up, that's okay, you gettin' played like Lenny Kravitz
I never had a father, like I said I'm such a bastard
You run up, uh cool, I'ma let your brain splatter
The bullet rim rattle

But my flow is unmatched, my flow is outmatched
My flow is so hard, your flow is wack
My flow is so crack, your flow is so me
My flow is so kill, your flow is so eeeh
I don't got time for it
Suck on my dick, tell your bitch to come over and swallow my kids
Choppa' on my hip I had to hollow my tips
Hallowed be thy name, pray to catch his ass slippin'
Pull up on his ass leave him leakin' I get 'em
Walkin' with a limp .40 heavy like I'm pimpin'
Matter fact I have 'em dancin' when I shoot it crippin'
Niggas talkin' stupid 'til that nigga end up missin'

I exposed like shrooms get it? I be truffilin'
It's Terry Crews with this shit you know I'm musclin'
Watchin' Regular Show laughin' at Muscle Man
Chip on my shoulder it's lookin' like a Pringles can
Desert Eagle on my hip, I'm not a Eagles fan
You know I'm from Chicago they my people man (yeah)

And become enemies of enemies
How come all of my enemies was friends to me
How come all my enemies is frienemies
How come all my enemies is blind
I catch 'em lackin' and kill 'em before I read all they energy

I'm so high that I cannot remember to forget
Matter of fact, let's just take a sec
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
And praise all the niggas that's left
I feel like I'm up in my prime
But who am I gon' share my prime with?
Who am I gon' share my time with?

Everybody talking 'bout they numb or something (wait)
Can you feel hell
All this fake shit around me is this some real hell?
All this sober shit around me is there some pills hell?
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah
Westwood shit
I'm up in London
Gettin' it bussin'
Ain't no disscusion, run up on me then I'm drummin'

Lookin' at my watch like that's a star (huh)
Lookin' at my spaceship like that's a car (huh)
Lookin' at my pills, them Xanny bars, nah
In 2016 I was poppin' them Xannies

Run up on me goin' harder than granny
Sit down muhfucker 'cause I know you can't stand it

Yeah, I did it
Mom, I made it
From goin' to physics class, to
Tourin' the world, shittin' on everybody, the world is my potty
I'm shitting on every possy
And I don't even got a team like that

Run up on me, choppa make you sing like that
Make you march like Martin Luther King, in fact
I'm blacked, and excellent
I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo' ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxipad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat
I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo' bitch I don't miss
Listen, I heard yo' bitch on my hitlist
I hit that bitch, then I'm dippin'
You run up on me, I'm shootin'
That choppa on me is spittin'
My wordplay is amazing
My flow is so brazy (huh)
I'm shakin' shit up like I said, no Haiti
This is freestyle shit, it's authentic
My flow, it burns niggas
Careers is arsenic (uh)
My flow badder than bad women
I rock shows like Kravitz and John Lennon
Yo' sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap god, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like [? 1:02:28] (hold on)
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch
Don't you forget it
The shit that you talking, I really lived it (uh)
I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em (uh)
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em (uh)
He talking stupid 'till they shoot him, that's my weapon (uh)
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo' head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr
My shit's off the charts
You run up, that's okay you catch a hole to your heart
I put that on my life, and that shit come from the heart
I'm freestyling on live, that's how it is
Yo' bitch swallow the kids
She up in my crib, I'm tellin' you how it is
Man, this rap shit serious like XM (huh)
I ex them (huh)
I fuck the bitch that he's next to (uh)
She hangin' out, fuck her curfew (uh)
You my son, lil' nigga I birthed you
But I shine, like the pair of them church shoes
I ain't been to church in a long time, 'cause they all lies
All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favourite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit
So cool
I breakdance shit like the old school
I'm never runnin' out of energy, I'm a suspect grippin' this [? 1:04:35] vicinity
Try me if you want, 'cause I swear it's not gon' end cool
I'ma prolly pull up to your cruel like, "Where the fuck is you"
Cock it back and then I shoot
W-W-W, I can't lose
Ayy, I flew from London to Chicago
Money in my pockets, I may get a Murciélago
That's all that I know
Shout out to my kinfolk, they know I'm totin' ammo
In the streets they call me Rambo, ain't no peace where I'm from
But these pieces, we tote 'em, you run up on me it's over
Like a cig, we gon' smoke 'em
I put yo' ass in a coma
Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo' ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics
Shut the fuck up and listen, I'm ballin' hard like a Piston
Nigga this shit's enlisted just like a army lil' nigga
I swear to god I'm invincible you can't harm me lil' nigga, yeah
I'm talkin' to you
I sent you my address a couple weeks ago, you ain't come through
'Cause you know we was gon' leave yo' ass dropped like a sunroof on a new coupe
Haha, I talk a lotta shit
But it all means something

 [Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive

[Verse 1: Valee & Juice WRLD]
Live on a Sunday, I think God want me to do that
Squeeze in a lunch date with your boo, might be what I wanna do
My shoes cost 3 racks, can't use tissues 'cause I'm removin' the scuffs
Adderall too potent, it takes too, yeah, yeah
These brand new Balenci's, I don't do layaway
And these hoes suckin' me up, day to day
And she know I'm not gon' let her stay today
She can't stay here, dumb bitch, you can't stay here
I'm in a straight A, still took too long, but I'm not missin' no exes
My bitch in a 2 door mini X, don't got more than two Xs
We keep a gun on us, it feel like they let us
Drippin' with no problem, like somebody wet us

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hmm, knew it wasn't love
Didn't know what it was
Thought you were on drugs
You say that I am, don't say shit, I shrug
Who am I to judge? Who am I to judge?
Who am I gon' love with you gone? Like uh
This shit got me feelin' all alone like no
It's to the point where I would want to hit your phone
Emotional, unavailable

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive




 [Intro]
I took it too far, I took it too far (too far)

[Chorus]
I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, I need to get away far
'Cause I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, I need to get away far

[Verse 1]
I'm taking two bars, now I am on mars
I took you too far, I'm taking your heart
You don't play your part, you don't play your part
No, I don't play fair, but I still play hard
(I took you too far, I took you too far, you don't play your part)

[Chorus]
I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, to get away far
I took you too far, she was my getaway broad
I need a getaway car, to get away far

[Verse 2]
I took you too far to where ever you are
Where ever you are, don't take it too far
I've been going to hard, tryna get yo attention
I know that you feel relentless
I've been feeling restless, 'cause I took it too far
To where ever you are
