[Produced by Benny Blanco]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself



[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



[Intro: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress and don't cry
Oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take, my hand

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and  I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we on top of the world cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like woah, oh God
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me "What's my best side?"
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me, it's all I mean, it's all I want baby
As long as you love me, your everyday I need
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me yeah, you love me
As long as you love me



[Intro]

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 1]
You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 2]
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(I wanna know)
Oh, what do you mean? (Ooh)
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Outro]
Oh, oh
(This is ours baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
(You're so confusing baby)
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(Be more straight forward)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Don't do it to me, don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that, I ain't never seen nothing like that
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That's right I think she foreign, I think she foreign
Got passports, mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room


[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
She said it's her first time, I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Explosive, explosive
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotised by the way she moves

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
She said it's her first time, I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

(Chance, the Rapper?)

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat
Stay faded like Diddy's hair, back tryna rock the vote
She the first mate when I rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock & roll
She say "I know, honey bunny
That's the funny thing"
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team
IGH!
She's confident

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
She said it's her first time, I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Still I gotta have it, still I gotta have it, still I gotta have it
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
But still I gotta have it



[Verse 1]
My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Verse 2]
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure

[Outro: Acoustic]
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

[Verse]
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

[Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

Tonight, I wanna show you off (aye-aye-aye)
What you got
A billion could've never bought (aye-aye-aye)

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I want to show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Body rock
Girl, I can feel your body rock (aye-aye-aye)
Take a bow
You're on the hottest ticket now, ooh (aye-aye-aye)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I want to show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
In time, ink lines
Bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine
Ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'mma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the East
Beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, beat will get deceased
Every time Beauty on the beat

[Break: Justin Bieber + (Nicki Minaj)]
Body rock (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, I wanna feel your body rock (let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do



[Intro: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber (Travis Scott)]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Alright, yeah, alright)

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
Cause I-I-I
I'm capable of anything
Of anything
And everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy
Your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for?
Ready for?
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or a no?
No maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?

Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for?
Ready for?
A perfect storm?
Perfect storm?
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no going back



[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus ]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 2]
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Bridge]
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar...

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "you're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

[Chorus]
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "you're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Outro]
Don't doubt it, don't doubt
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it, you know it
Still rise
Just fight it, just fight it
Don't be surprised, I will still rise



[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
So you want some more
Well I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon appétit, baby

Bon appétit, baby
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Sweet potato pie
It'll change your mind
Got you running back for seconds
Every single night

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I'm the one they say can change your life
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (Blast)
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like

[Verse 5: Offset]
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

[Verse 6: Quavo]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby



[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Outro]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon



[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a dirty mind I got filthy ways
I’m tryna bathe my ape in your Milky Way
I’m a legend I'm irreverent I be reverend
I’ll be so faaaaa-ar up
We don't give a fuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because yo boy Yeezy get ass a lot

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
You’re so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You’re not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don’t understand you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim

Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 3: Katy Perry]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me

Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim

Your touch, so foreign

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit about the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex
I'mma disrobe you
Then I'mma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch are foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

Toned, tan, fit and ready

Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
(Uh!) The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie

Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)

There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

While I kiss your neck and shoulders

Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

[Verse 2]
You bring me to my knees, you make me testify
You can make a sinner change his ways
Open up your gates cause I can't wait to see the light
And right there is where I wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah yeah yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah yeah yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?

[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Outro]
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!
Aw, yeah yeah
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!



[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out of my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Outro]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Kook what you've done

You're just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops

We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby

[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
Cause what you don't understand is...

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ooh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no, oh

[Verse 2]
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad women
That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ooh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Bridge]
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darlin' I'd still...

[Chorus]
Catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same
No, no, no, no oh



[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, when I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
(Oh, don't you give up)
Girl won't you listen?
(Don't you give up)
It's you that I'm missin'
(Don't you give up)
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
(All the way)
If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
(No, no, no, no)
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye
(Come on, come on) goodbye (Oh baby, baby)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye



[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal
With these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood
Graining-graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving-swerving on that
Big body been serving all this
Swerve, surfing all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Interlude: Jay Z]
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Part 1: Yoncé

[Intro]
Let me hear you say "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking babe

[Bridge]
Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)
I do this all for you baby just take aim
And tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)
Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
Cuz when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
Part 2: Partition

[Also presumably produced by Timbaland, Jerome Harmon, Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé Knowles, Key Wane, Mike Dean and BOOTS]

[Verse 1]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

[Pre-Hook]
Oh there daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh baby baby we betta slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook]
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Is right here with me

[Verse 2]
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash

[Pre-Hook]
Oh there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh baby baby be sweating out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook]

I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Is right here with me

[Bridge]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

[Hook]
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Is right here with me



[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment
That’s why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
‘Cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’
And this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty
And this ain’t no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
‘Cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

[Hook 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Hook 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Hook 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....

[Verse 3: Drake]
From 8 until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights I don’t know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Hook 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to
[Hook 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....

[Verse 4: Drake]
I gotta pull up on you
You gon make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'mma go Thriller on you, I'mma just
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you, I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cuz they don’t wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they all
Your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you’re done with that
And I believe it's true as long as you know who you belong to

[Outro: Beyonce]
All I’m really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to

Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me -

All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick

Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess-cut diamonds, on my Disney
He want "Monster Nicki", in Sri Lanka
I told him, "Meet me at the Trump, Ivanka"
I said "Come here, let me show you, how this cookie taste"
This that, "Yeah nigga, eat the cookie" face

[Outro]
(Right, right, right)



[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

[Verse 1]
He trying to roll me up, I ain't picking up
Headed to the club, I ain't thinking 'bout you
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cup
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

[Bridge]
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Hook]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

[Verse 2]
Now you want to say you're sorry
Now you want to call me crying

And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
(You interrupting my grinding)
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Hook]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Verse 3]
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

[Visual breakdown]



[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Outro]
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up



[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me (whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

[Outro]
What are you doing my love?



[Intro]
Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome Beyonce, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly and Ashley
The Hip-Hop Rapping: Girls' TYME

Part 1 - Bow Down

[Hook]
I’m out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I’m coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I’m coming down
Coming down, dripping candy on the ground

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches (crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

H, H-town, town, I’m coming down
Coming down, dripping candy on the ground

Part 2 - ***Flawless

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind  that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Hook: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn!

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Hook: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn!

[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town, no post code envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...)
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2]
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...)
Let me live that fantasy

[Bridge]
(Oooh ooooh ohhh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
(Oooooh ooooh ohhhhh)
Life is great, without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...)
Let me live that fantasy

[Intro]
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out

[Verse 1]
Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Bridge]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Outro]
We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know



[Produced by Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon, I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games,up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know it's not forever (yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

[Bridge]
It looked alright in the pictures
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it?
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window
And you can watch from your window

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)

[Outro]
And talk it up like (yeah)
And talk it up like (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like (yeah)
And talk it up like (yeah)
And talk it up like (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like (yeah) (yeah)



[Verse 1]
I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

[Refrain]
Those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

[Refrain]
All those rumors, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Outro]
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Verse 1: Lorde]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus 1: Lorde]
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Verse 2: Lorde]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus 2: Lorde]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Bridge: Lorde]
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em-

[Outro: Lorde]
You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)
You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

[Verse 1]
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
Till the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Verse 2]
Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Bridge]
We're never done with killing time

I love these roads where the houses don't change

And I like you...
And I like you...
I like you

[Verse 1]
I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby, it's okay)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Explosions on T.V
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Verse 2]
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

[Chorus]
And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favourite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

[Bridge]
Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Chorus]
And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favourite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you



[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Verse 2]
The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun

[Verse 1]
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (oh!)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (oh!)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Verse 2]
Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (oh!)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (oh!)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold lie promises, we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, "Secretly you love this
Do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious



[Verse 1]
We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now

[Chorus]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this

[Verse 2]
If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
Fill my dashboard just the same

[Chorus]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this
And we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this

[Interlude]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

[Bridge]
I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights
In the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing, and love it

[Interlude]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

[Outro]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are out



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2]
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don’t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 1]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it

And I know she'll be the death of me

This I know, girl, I know

She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it

[Verse 1]
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

[Hook]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 2]
Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class grey 'matic
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

[Hook]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Bridge]
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"

[Verse 1]
Recommend play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein

[Chorus]
You know me, you know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

[Chorus]
You know me, you know me
You know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

[Outro]
'Cause you know me, they know me
You ain't know me, yet you know me



[Verse 1]
I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards, too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

[Bridge]
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words, too
Just let me motherfucking love you

[Hook]
Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself
So tell me you love me
(Only for tonight, only for tonight)
Even though you don't love me
Just tell me you love me
(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me

[Verse 2]
Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
Get you dancing with the Devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

[Bridge]
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank

Even though you don't love me

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 2]
Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'mma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Verse 3]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
And I've seen her get richer in the pole
I've seen her, I knew she had to know
I've seen her take down that tequila
Down by the liter, I knew I had to meet her
Ooh, she mine, ooh girl, bump and grind
Ooh, she mine, ooh girl, bump a line
Angelina, lips like Angelina
Like Selena, ass shaped like Selena

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I've been poppin', just took three in a row
I'm down to do it again, I'm on a roll
I've seen him outside tryna reach her
You tryna leave him, you said I'm the reason
Tell me lies, ooh girl, tell me lies
Say you're mine, I'm yours for the night
I'm the realest, she said I'm the realest
Head be genius, dick game be the meanest

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I'm like got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains

[Intro]
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c’est toi qu’on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c’est toi qu’on laissera

Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas

[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cuz I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

[Hook]
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cuz ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I’m alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on

[Verse 2]
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

[Hook]
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cuz ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I’m alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on

If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on

[Outro]
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles

Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là

[Intro]
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray that I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'mma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find baseheads and hot women

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign

[Chorus]
Look at all that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work



[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be all right

[Pre-Hook]
My head's under water but I’m breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Hook]
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I’m around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

[Pre-Hook]
My head's under water but I’m breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Hook]
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Bridge]
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it’s hard

[Hook]
Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Outro]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you



[Produced by Dave Tozer, John Legend & Malay]

I... Yeah

[Verse 1]
You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

[Pre hook]
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

[Hook]
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

[Verse 2]
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine

[Pre hook]
And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

[Hook]
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

[Bridge]
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

[Hook]
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Oooh, I've never seen anything
It's much more than you and me
Extraordinary machine

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Oooh, have you ever known
We laid your eyes on
The perfect work of art
I knew right from the start
Oooh, I was never sure of a God before
But I know he must exist
He created this...

[Chorus: John Legend]
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)

[Verse 1: Common]
Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, "Stay down", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

[Chorus]
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)

[Bridge: John Legend]
Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done
We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), ohhh (glory, glory)
We'll cry glory, oh glory, ohhh (glory, glory)

[Verse 2: Common]
Selma is now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory

[Chorus]
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Yeah (Glory, glory)
[Outro: John Legend]
When the war is won, when it's all said and done
We'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)

[Intro: Lenny Kravitz]
When was the last time we got to be 100% real, ya'll?
I don't want ya'll holding back nothing!

[John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
We made a lot of magic
It’s the only way we know
Let’s keep the night fantastic
Light it up, tell me more, explore
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why’d we ball so hard?

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Bridge: John Legend]
We’ve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin’ fast, I’m never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Semi in the truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like I’m Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I don’t know about y’all, but I feel good tonight
There’s something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?

[Lenny Kravitz]
This is our song – our song for the future

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm that kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls
So tempt me to jetset away in London
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ooh (La la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"
So let's run away, let's run away, way, way
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I remember when the pilot closed the door
Said it's time for lift off
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"
Don't ever wonder, cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top, you'll never question why you left
Ohh, my world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away, let's run away
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is

[Hook: John Legend and Teyana Taylor]



[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We've passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, this time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, this time we'll take it slow

[Verse 3]
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you''ll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow
We'll never know
Baby, you and I

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh oh, this time we'll take it slow



[Verse 1: John Legend]
Alright
Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl, what you playing for?
Ay, come on
Come on let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and then the breaststroke
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love)
The best you ever had

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
(For real)

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had



[Produced by Dave Tozer, Hit Boy & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Last night was the last night
You'll ever spend alone
Couldn’t wait, did it in the living room
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans
Plans to do it 'til we have a baby
Even if the world is crazy
Pick some names, boy or girl
Then we’ll change, change the world

[Hook]
So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
I’m ready, whatever time
It’s the beginning of forever
You don’t have to call
Sometimes you just know
It’s the beginning of forever
You don’t have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh

[Verse 2]
Last time was the last time, I was worn and done
You the best, that's why I want another one
Soon as I saw you, baby I had plans
Plans to take you to my elevator
And cook a little breakfast later
Pick a place and go there, girl
Then we’ll change, change the world

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
So I went hard like Medusa starin at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kind of star"
No, I'm a comet; I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin! We both goin' to where you livin'!
Eh-HAH!! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just stylefreein', freestylin' which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose

[Hook: John Legend]
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now (Let's go!)
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

[Overlap: Andre 3000]
You got you one, Legend!
Sometimes you gotta step from behind that piano!
And let 'em know what's going on
Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes..Hahaha!

On some faded love

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would dare me
Ooh, that's all I want

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna and Kanye]
Yeah, 'bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days ‘til Friday
I’m tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

[Bridge: Rihanna]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna and Kanye]
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Cause that's all I want



[Verse 1: Rihanna]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said show me something
He said, "If you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know"

[Hook: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2: Mikky Ekko]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

[Hook: Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Bridge: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
The reason I hold on
Cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Hook: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh



[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

[Verse 1]
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’mma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’mma pick your  poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it
I’m off that la-la
I’mma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yea

[Chorus 2]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’mma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like stations
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

[Outro]
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me so amazing
(This is the best there is)

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby

From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

So do what you want

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, cause it's our life
(Let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yeah I got what you want
You want to escape
All of the crazy shit
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing, girl

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want

Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yea we taking these haters and we roughin' em up
And we layin' in the club like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]

If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, cause
You don't own my life but

Do what you want with my body...



[Verse 1]
(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 2]
We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
(Cause I'm broken)
Let's white- (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here!
(And I feel so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Speaking]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my sex dreams)
[iTunes Festival Demo Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool
I was naked, boy, so were you
And we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
And now it's time for the trial with doubts and drawls
(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [laughs])

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby could I bear
Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love
(I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch

I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art’s in pop culture, in me


[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to get control
Pressure’s takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn’t love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2]
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn’t love, it wasn’t love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

[Bridge]
Where are you?
Cause I can’t see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Where are you?
Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin’ me
Illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Where were you
Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion
You were a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion (illusion)

[Outro]
Where were you 'cause I can't see it
It was perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me, baby
Somewhere in all the confusion
Dilated, fallin' free
You were so perfect
In a modern ecstasy
You were a perfect illusion



[Intro]
I am so fab, check out
I'm blonde, I'm skinny
I'm rich, and I'm a little bit of a bitch

[Verse 1]
I wanna dress you up in silk, Taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt, what's your size?
This purse can hold my black card and tiara
Versace promises I will Dolce Vita

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I’m smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-Mi-Bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I’m the pearl to your oyster, I’m a babe)
I’m gonna smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne)

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood
Voodoo, Voodoo, Voo-Don-Na-Na

[Verse 2]
Walk down the runway but don’t puke (it’s okay)
You just had a salad today, Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice, before you
Get a spray tan on holiday, in Taipei

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I’m smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-Mi-Bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day

I’m gonna smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood

[Interlude]
Check it out, take it in
Cuz that bitch, she’s so thin (oh la la la)
She’s so rich, and so blonde
She’s so fab, it’s beyond

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Bridge]
Donatella!
Oh oh oh oh

All of the day
I’m gonna wear designer and forget your name

Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So I said

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus]

Cuz I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy I'm
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy I'm
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy I'm
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby! Why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think
With you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
Cuz it's you and me!

[Post-Chorus 3]
Baby, for life
(if you go with me?)
For life
(see the world with me)

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Russia, U.K, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...



[Intro: Lady Gaga]
I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood

[Breakdown: Lady Gaga]
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Interlude: Lady Gaga]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run
Away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 1]
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run
Away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 2]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run
Away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Bridge]
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

[Chorus]
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run
Away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

‘Cause I may not know you, just let me hold you
You be my soldier, like you from the ‘Nolia

[Hook: Usher]
Make you say uh, no limit
Got that Master P, no limit, baby

Just know when you roll with a nigga like me

Just know when you roll with a nigga like me

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
You finer than wine, baby girl I ain’t lyin'

Commit a crime, jeopardize my lifeline
Just to see your vital signs

Ain’t no limit babe when you a starter
MARTA outsmart the Rari, Rari
Fill the session with Bacardi Barbies
Kerosene, kerosene
Promise spin, washing machine (wishy washy)
Thin waisted primadonna
Never limit, I’m a stunner
Tinted out, them never rentals
Fuck them boys, they all beginners

I’ma spend my night with ‘dem
I could put karats all over you
Karats all over you
Never mind, we only poppin’ shit
Man I been getting high with these fools
And she said all her friends fake, so she solo rockin'
And she a real bad bad bitch, she ain’t gotta Photoshop it

[Hook: Usher]
Uh, no limit
I C Mur-Mur-Murder that, no limit baby
Give you that ghetto D, girl, no limit
Just know when you roll with a nigga like me
There's no limit, baby

[Intro]
Make every minute worth it, baby
This for Usher, baby
Watch this

[Hook]
I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin' that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

[Verse 1]
It's 5 in the mornin'
Kush is rollin' while she's makin' steak and eggs
At 5 in the mornin'
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

[Refrain]
See, I told her, the devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

[Pre-Ch­orus 1]
I think that she's a winner
She could be a keeper

[Ch­orus]
Cause she's such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
She's such a good kisser
I'ma rain on this parade
Oh baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This girl, she's my hero
Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen
(I ain't one to trick off either)
I'm starin' at your barrel
Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe
(What ever you want, I told her)

[Refrain]

[Pre-Ch­orus 2]
I think I got a winner
Could be a keeper

[Ch­orus]

[Verse 3]
Listen, the only thing I know
You give it to me, baby, with good flow
Don't ever run it back, come on, keep goin'
Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me
I can't keep my control
Every time that I see you hit that floor
Just keep on givin' it to me, I want more
Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it up to me

[Bridge x4]
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night

[Ch­orus] + [Hook]



[Intro: Usher + Future]
She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

[Verse 1: Usher + Future]
So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

[Hook: Usher + Future]
Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals
(You gotta give me that)
I put that on the Bible
(You gotta give me that girl)
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feelin'
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone
You gotta give me dirty love

[Verse 2: Usher]
I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though
I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling startin' to get too familiar
So cover up this broken love treason

[Hook: Usher + Future]
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals

You're the only thing that I want

Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you bae that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone

[Bridge: Usher]
You say I see ya side by side
Like a visionary, I can't see me falling
(Nothing's changed)
Like a dictionary, I can't read through all this
(Eyes wide open)
I still fall blind I don't know how this will end
Let's go back to the beginning
Let's cover up this broken love treason

[Hook: Usher]
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals

You're the only thing that I want

[Outro]
Gimme that

Yes you are

I was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels (hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me
I decided to chill (okay!)
Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out!)
Ohh! (watch out)
She's saying, come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her (let's go!) I said

[Verse 2: Usher & Lil Jon]
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that's just ain't me (hey!)
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low

She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah

[Verse 3: Ludacris & Lil Jon]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'mma milk the cow (yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (what?)
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put em on foot patrol (let's go!)
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

[Hook: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me

Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming

[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (can you hear me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn



[Intro: Usher, Alicia Keys & Both]
There's always that one person that will always have your heart
You never see it coming 'cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see
Oh baby, ooh
You will always be my boo
See, I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock

[Verse 1: Usher]
Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys]
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (my boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys with Usher]
Yes, I remember, boy
'Cause after we kissed, I could only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
I was there
And you were my baby

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys]
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (my boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my...

[Bridge: Usher & Alicia Keys]
Oh, my oh, my oh, my oh, my, my boo
My oh, my oh, my oh, my oh, my boo

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys]
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

[Outro: Usher]
I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
It started when we were younger
My boo...



[Intro]
Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creeping with, creeping with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keeping it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, trying to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinking, contemplating
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racing to her place
Talking to myself, preparing to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said "one second, baby, please hear me"

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions



[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy ( I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Bridge: Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Hook]
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Hook 1]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground

[Pre-Hook]
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me

[Bridge]
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you win

[Interlude]
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Oh baby, are you listening?
Oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Bridge]
I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity, you and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what He was doing
When He led me to you

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you



[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying, crying

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd, man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U
SMH, I'm pressing "send" on you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping? Let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue no more, I do it all for you
You know you're my ride or die baby, let me show you

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U
SMH, I'm pressing "send" on you

[Bridge: French Montana & (Miley Cyrus)]
(Ooh, ooh, two letters for you) Letters for you
What you trippin' on? Girl, you know you wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U
SMH, I'm pressing "send" on you

Oh shit, pass that shit around, baby
That shit true, but I don't hear a sound

I'm a Southern belle, crazier than hell
Getting wild up in here, getting live up in here

Oh yeah, I'm a Southern belle

[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu



[Intro]
Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy
Yeah I smoke pot, (do it) yeah I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck (do it), I ain't no hippy (ah)

[Chorus]
Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy
Yeah I smoke pot, (do it) yeah I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy (do it)

[Bridge]
(I understand) feel like I am one with the universe
(I understand) and all I need is right here
(I understand) feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Verse 1]
(I understand) why there is a sun?
And how do birds fly?
And why there is a moon
Way up in the sky?
Why there is trees? (do it)
And what the fuck is love? (do it)
And what is flying saucers
Watching from above?
(Yo, fuck, man)

[Bridge]
Feel like I am one with the universe
And all I need is right here
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, sing about love, love is what you need
Loving what you sing, and loving smoking weed
(Weed, weed, weed, weed)
Sing about peace, being high and free
So if you don't give a fuck, sing along with me

[Chorus]
Yeah I smoke pot (smoke pot), yeah I love peace (love peace)
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippy

[Verse 2]
(I understand) why there is a sky?
And why do pigs run?
And why them motherfuckers
Putting bullets in they gun?
Violence is king
But peace is the way
Someday we’re gonna see it
So here's what I'm saying

[Outro]
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
So peace mu'fucker (do it)
Why they put the dick in the pussy?
Fuck you



[Prod. by Mike WiLL Made It]

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Bangerz... fuckin' bangerz
Bangerz... fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz!

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting 'round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & (Miley Cyrus)]
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on my speed dial?)
You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane
‘Bout to get that big rock
Sit that on my hand
Make that media big talk
The plane, boss, the plane
Psych, that must be the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I, I, I
Bangerz
I, I, I
Fucking bangerz
I, I, I
Bangerz
I, I, I
Fucking bangerz
I, I, I
I, I, I



[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever is out the door
I'll ignore when you call

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you?
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Bridge]
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on
I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all broken promises I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there done that

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it



[Intro: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge: Taylor Swift + Kendrick Lamar]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!



[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
Heard from you
I should just tell you to leave
Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go round and round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
I say "I've heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking about you, and I"
I said "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Just take me home

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back everytime
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style



[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
“Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake.”
Love’s a game, want to play, hey?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain’t it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let’s be friends
I’m dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over, mhm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
’Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
’Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless, hm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You’re the King, baby, I’m your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
“Oh my God, who is she?”
I get drunk on jealousy
But you’ll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over, mhm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
’Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
’Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless, hm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t, say I didn’t warn ya
Boys only want love if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t, say I didn’t warn ya

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over, mhm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
’Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
’Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless, hm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name



[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus 1: ZAYN]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: ZAYN]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

[Pre-Chorus 2: Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: ZAYN & (Taylor Swift)]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, ZAYN & Both]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: ZAYN]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Outro: Taylor Swift & ZAYN]
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home



[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!



[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "heaven can’t help me now"
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you’ll see me again, even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again, even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again, even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah ha



[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

[Post-Chorus]
(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (last december)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

[Post-Chorus]
(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
20 stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
I remember, oh I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good



[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

[Chorus]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back it's all in the timing
It's poker, you can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

[Chorus]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Breakdown]
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic, it's so romantic

[Chorus]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

[Chorus]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear, comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, that's what people say

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don’t see, that's what they don’t see
I'm dancing on my own, I make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know, that’s what they don’t know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey!
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And dirty, dirty cheats of the world you could've been getting down to this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, “oh my God”, but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off



[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I won't let go (I won't let go, no no, no no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Bridge: MØ]
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone’s gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + MØ]
I won't let go, no no, no no, no more
I'll be your lifeline tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I won't let go, no no, no no, no more
I'll be your lifeline tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Verse 1]
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the night was warm
And we were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

[Bridge]
All we need is somebody to lean on
(We need someone to lean on)
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

[Chorus]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

I loaded my clip in and told her, "Don't get nervous"
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy Bang, bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker, ball like a dribble
Put you in a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you tripping? I'm a crazy individual

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain’t got the money, we ain’t getting out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need’s relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream (Dream, dream, dream)

[Verse 2]
All of my life been wading in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend?
Coming down, feeling like a battery hen
Waves won’t break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams? (Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh, hey)

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream (Dream, dream, dream)

We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me

Most of these dudes is really quite soft

'Bout to drop a album, this is my fourth
I don't put sugar in my spaghetti sauce
Drop a freestyle and get these hoes parched
Fire burn the obea man church
Pretty girls, when my girls get right
'Cause it's another day, let ya light shine bright
Ain't none of them in your lane
True mi have di game pon lock, dem wah code

Yo, I told 'em pull up on me faster than Danica

He call me queen, he know "Nicki" is the moniker
He want a mix between Hillary and Monica

Rip the beat, then I, I stitch it up

Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah

[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together

He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah

Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide

Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the skies
Someday soon, we'll be together

We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together

Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we can be together, be together

Ten bottles, bought ten more
Told her move her ass to the tempo

Fuck niggas, hate real niggas, get money

Yo! When I was young and my dad had a reefer house
I'd catch a contact and talk like Eek-A-Mouse
Go to school act like I'm pulling reefer out
Kinda funny cause I used to freak my teachers out
Like "dong dong diddy dong dong", seen?
So much mi go teach ya bout
Peace to the one Black Chiney and the heaters out
In the club, everybody on Sinatra
Look around, everybody on Sinatra
I ain't talking bout this shit they call Coke and vodka
I'm talking bout the shit you snort and go "ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"
I mean just go bonkers
Make the young girls wild, and then go topless
Make the dope boy smile they don’t need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas
Brrap brrap brrap they got ya

[Verse 2]
Skateboard can a nigga make more?

Child Rebel Soldier hit that ass for the combo

Hauling that ass like a new Veyron

Riding with my bitch mane all night long
One second I'm here next second I’m gone

Now you jealous with your face screwed on
Who on? Nigga you on?
Feeble ass niggas only get booed on
Shitty attitude get pissed and pooed on
Fucking with P? You wrong
Retreat nigga, you don’t wanna feud on
Your nerves ain't there for a big dude on
Stompin' that ass until you gone
Hoping that you make it home wit' yo shoes on
While I'm tourin' these booties, scoring these movies
I know that I made it when I’m chilling with Stewie
Ask Marc Jacobs what I did for Louis
Sunglasses campaign and jewelery
Ask Alber how he really wanna use me
Comme Des Garçons I ain't usin' that loosely
Look at your forehead sweating profusely

[Verse 1: Louis]
I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

[Chorus: Harry + All]
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Verse 2: Niall]
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
When I first saw you, from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Harry]
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

[Chorus: Liam & Niall & (Louis) & Harry​]
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Verse 1: Harry & Liam]
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside, the story of my life

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside, the story of my life

[Bridge: Zayn & Niall]
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen

[Chorus: All & Harry]
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside, the story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life



[Verse 1: Niall]
Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

[Chorus: Harry & All]
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

[Verse 2: Liam]
Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

[Chorus: Harry & All]
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity, infinity, infinity
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity



[Verse 1: Harry & Liam]
If I could fly, I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenceless

[Chorus: Harry]
For your eyes only, I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only, for your eyes only

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
I've got scars even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard, but now you're here and I don't feel a thing
Pay attention, I hope that you listen cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenceless

[Chorus: All]
For your eyes only, I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only, for your eyes only

[Bridge: Louis & Harry]
I can feel your heart inside of mine, I feel it, I feel it
I've been going out of my mind, I feel it, I feel it
Know that I'm just wasting timeAnd I hope that you don't run from me

[Chorus: Liam & All & Harry]
For your eyes only, I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only, I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only, for your eyes only
For your eyes only



[Verse 1: Harry & Niall]
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong, I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong, thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Chorus: All]
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Verse 2: Liam]
All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong, thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Chorus: All]
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Bridge: Louis]
Minibars, expensive cars, hotel rooms, and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes, but they don't mean anything
Cause the truth is out, I realize that without you here life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end, we can make, it you know it, you know

[Chorus: All]
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Outro: Harry & All & Liam]
So don't let me go, so don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know
We can live forever



[Verse 1: Niall]
Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody
But he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see is you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything
Right now I can be your vice

[Chorus: Liam & All & Niall]
All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

[Verse 2: Harry]
The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watching
Your body's saying everything
I don't have to read your mind
Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off
Now we're taking it off tonight

[Chorus: Liam & All & Harry]
All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

[Bridge: Louis & Harry]
We can roll in the darkness
Let me touch you where your heart is
And if you're feeling the weakness
Well I told you baby that you can call me
I'll be your temporary fix, you can call me

[Chorus: All & Harry]
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night



[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if its true , it's you,  it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things



[Intro: Harry]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Niall]
Feels like this could be forever tonight, break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 going on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town, got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

[Chorus: Harry]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses and talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Liam]
Feels like this could be forever right now, don't wanna sleep cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learn how
You and me were raised  in the same part of town, got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

[Chorus: Louis]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses and talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah yeah

[Bridge: Harry]
You know I'm always coming back to this place
You know and I'll say
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
You know

[Chorus: Harry & Louis]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses and talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah yeah

[Outro: Louis & Harry]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always coming back to this place
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah yeah



[Verse 1: Niall]
Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'll be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

[Chorus: Harry]
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Verse 2: Liam]
Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I’m having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

[Chorus: Harry]
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Bridge: Harry]
When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do, I love you

[Chorus: Louis]
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go



[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you



[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill



[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking about how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
So, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are



[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe



[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl



[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah
You're home"

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah
You're home"

[Outro/Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, "Hallelujah
You're home"



[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight



[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

[Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser



[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 1]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 2]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home



[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing, "I write my own tune and I write my own verse," hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man

[Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning

[Verse 4]
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!

[Bridge]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

[Instrumental break]

[Interlude]
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea

[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day

[Verse 6]
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu

[Outro]
Cool…

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, I am the truth
Ayy, I am the wisdom of the fallen; I'm the youth
Ayy, I am the greatest
Ayy, this is the proof
Ayy, I work hard, pray hard, pay dues, ayy
I transform with pressure - I'm hands-on with effort
I fell twice before, my bounce back was special
Letdowns'll get you, and the critics will test you
But the strong'll survive, another scar may bless you, ah

[Pre-Chorus: Sia (Kendrick Lamar)]
Don't give up (no no), I won't give up (no no)
Don't give up, no no no (nah)
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, no no no)
The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, no no no)

[Outro: Sia]
The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive

The greatest, the greatest alive

The greatest, the greatest alive
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)

[Verse 1]
Party girls don't get hurt
Can’t feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone’s blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

[Pre-Chorus]
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

[Post-Chorus]
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

[Verse 2]
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

[Pre-Chorus]
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

[Post-Chorus]
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

[Outro]
On for tonight
Yeah I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
Yeah I'm just holding on for tonight

Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight



[Intro: Sia]
I won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up

[Verse 1: Sia]
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus: Sia]
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

[Pre-Chorus: Sia & The Weeknd]
You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus: Sia]
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 1]
I'm trying but I keep falling down
I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

[Chorus]
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need

[Verse 2]
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

[Chorus]
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium

[Bridge]
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down down down
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down down down
You lift me up before I hit the ground!

[Chorus]
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down down down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium




[Couplet 1 : Maître Gims]
Tu m'as demandé pardon, j't'ai repoussé (repoussé)
J'voulais qu'tu comprennes que je souffrais (je souffrais)
Mais t'as laissé ton odeur sur les draps (sur les draps)
J'donnerai tout pour être dans tes bras (dans tes bras)

Et j'ai tenté d'te haïr mais la colère est partie
Les bons souvenirs l'emportent sur la haine et la rancœur

[Refrain : Sia]
I forgive you, you know not what you have done
Ohh I, I forgive you, now it's time for me to move on
Ohh I, I forgive you, you did not see right from wrong
Ohh I, and I love you, always in my heart you'll live on
You'll live on
You'll live on

[Couplet 2 : Maître Gims]

[Verse 1]
Clipped wings, I was a broken thing
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing
You would wind me down
I struggled on the ground
So lost, the line had been crossed
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk
You held me down
I struggle to fly now

[Refrain]
Oh, but there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive
Oh, yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Chorus]
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

[Post-Chorus]
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

[Verse 2]
Now I fly, hit the high notes
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight
You held me down
But I fought back loud

[Refrain]
Oh, cause there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive
Oh, yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

[Post-Chorus
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free



[Verse 1]
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I played on my own
I survived
Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Post-Chorus]
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing

[Bridge]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went in and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive

[Outro]
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive



[Verse 1]
Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
The fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when
(Reaper)

[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today

[Verse 2]
So come back when I'm good and old
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when
(Reaper)

[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today

And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

She say, "you need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say you need a real nigga she said yes Lord
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl

[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor
'Cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature
I live for danger

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

[Refrain]
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]

I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body

Tell me what you came here for
'cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you

[Outro]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body

You understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'

And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder

The ones that love me I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & (The Weeknd)]
Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up)

Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace)
I got a hundred G's in my Goyard (G's)
My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle
While I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (I might)

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I might empty my bank account (ooh)
And buy that boy with a pipe (ooh, yeah)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might (slide)
Empty my bank account (ooh, slide)
And buy that boy with a pipe (slide, yeah)
(Do you slide on all your nights like this?)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might



[Chorus:  Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus:  Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for

We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
I say "your place" when we leave

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
Oh, oh



[Verse 1: Florence Welch]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2: Florence Welch]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

[Outro: Florence Welch]
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing



[Intro: Young Thug]

80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time

Everybody thinking that's a cartoon

Do you want some? No I don't, son
Tryna watch me ballin', do you want money?
I'm just tryna turn up, tryna work something
Shawty suck the dick good, she wanna fuck it first

No shave, Brazilian wax

[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Verse 1: Future]
L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci (get what I'm sayin'?)
L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci (get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammy's, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (when I rolled up)

[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind

So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway

[Verse 2: Future]
Pluto
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', Chanel drapes on me, baby
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', she look like she's sponsored by Mercedes
Dig what I'm sayin', this Creed cologne is on me, baby (you dig?)
Dig what I'm sayin'? I'm goin' hard (hard, yeah)
I pop up bubbly in your memory
You should be glad I'm showin' you sympathy (showin' you sympathy)
I gave you real love out the gutter (out the gutter)
Ever let you go, you gon' suffer (you gon' suffer from it)

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas (shottas)
I gotta accept that I'm a monster

[Outro: Khalid & Future]
Yeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg
Nah Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave you my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Lookin' at your last text
Damn did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it?
I've been breakin' up with girls since I was 15
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin'
I got more liquor, more ladies, more drugs and no cases
With jobs and no babies
I hope no phone’s taping and if so you gon' hate me

[Hook: Big Sean]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couple's counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

Let me see how big your mouth is

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are on me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do
Body language speaks louder than verbal

[Hook: Big Sean]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couple's counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

Let me see how big your mouth is


[Outro: Big Sean]
This goes out to, uh, you know who this goes out to, yeah!

(Hey!)



[Verse]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love as the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now, but you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

[Drop]

[Verse]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love as the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now, but you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
Summer

[Drop]

[Bridge]
When I met you in the summer
Summer

[Drop]



[Verse 1]
Look at what you've done
Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm holdin’ on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Verse 2]
So you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm holdin’ on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

[Outro]
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside



[Verse 1]
Oh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore, anymore
I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to god, I just don't know anymore

[Verse 2]
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down anything in life, I know now
I've been lyin' on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you, give into you

[Verse 3]
Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you, give into you

[Bridge]
Can't hold back, reachin' out
(Hot, hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
Between us, I told you that
(Hot, hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give into you
Give into you

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you, give into you
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you, give into you



[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Ah, ah, you’re beautiful
(Yeah)
Ah, ah, you’re beautiful

[Verse 1: Miguel]
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby do it again

[Chorus: Miguel]
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere
‘Cause it’s beautiful, ooh you make me feel undressable
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

[Chorus: Miguel & Mariah Carey]

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You don’t know what you’re doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don’t you worry darling



[Verse 1]
Sweet love yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
’Cause I didn’t know you, ’cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
‘Cause I don’t have a choice
Or what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here
’Cause baby

[Hook]
Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
It's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things crying trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
Pain reflected in this song is not even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life baby

[Hook]
Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
‘Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Intro]
I was like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"

So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Verse 1]
All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

[Chorus]
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...

[Verse 2]
You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'mma let you starve
Gasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation

[Chorus]
Why you so obsessed with me? and boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Mmm, baby, I'm so into you

Creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

Jump, jump, let me see you do the stump
Girls, let me see you shake your rump
Brothers, hit it from the back and front
And let's do it, do it, do it, uh-huh
I'm a little bit of Country
I'm a little bit of Rock and Roll
And I'm soul to soul
Big letters all big and bold
Old Dirty Bastard bask and blow

Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

[Intro: Mariah]
Uh, whoa, whoa
MC's got a new boyfriend {Yeah}
Mariah and Cameo sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

[Mariah](Cameo)
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh baby
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh baby (oh)
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh baby
Whoo!

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I need a, I need a
I need a, I need a
I love a, love a
I love a, love a
A lover, a lover
A lover, a loverboy

[Verse 1: Mariah]
I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go, it's delivered on time

(Repeat 1 in background)
He's all mine
And his loving makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus: Mariah]
Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy, come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long

[Verse 2: Mariah]
I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delivered on time

{Repeat 1 in background)
I get weak
When he's gettin' extra sweet
When he caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus: Mariah]

[Verse 3: Cameo]
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you, yes I do
Cause you affect me, you fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh
This stuff is starting now, oh
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, ooh
My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
Candy!
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy
It's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you, indeed I do
Just for you...

Repeat 1 till end w/ ad-libs from Cameo



[Hook: Mariah]
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They told me get 'em, I got 'em
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I have never asked for no hand outs
You won’t carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they are not mad at me
I’m on fire and I’m going to burn
And I am not going to learn
I remember they said that it is not my turn
But it is not confirmed, then the tables turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop, because I’m going to climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let go

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Path that I chose flashing camera’s as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred racks she don’t know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it’s hundred and millions this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the bomb achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Hook: Mariah]
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

[Bridge: Mariah]
Can’t fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby, still know who you are
So you got to keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It’s not too far

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)



[Verse 1]
Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
That’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none of that without me though
Ain’t none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you don’t already know

[Chorus]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

[Verse 2]
How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully I’m through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain’t no compliments (duh)
Ain’t no being friends (duh)
Ain’t no false pretense (duh)
Ain’t no make amends (duh)
Ain’t no come against (duh)
That’s the story, ain’t no happy ends

[Chorus]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

[Bridge]
Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like you’re so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe

[Chorus]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

[Outro]
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream



[Intro]
I-I-I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, oooh

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Hook]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you (you, baby)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just going to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Hook]
'cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you (you, baby)

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Hook]
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is...

[Outro]
Youuuu
You, baby
Youuuu
All, all, all, all
Youuuu



[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
I know that you've been waiting for it, I'm waiting too
In my imagination I'd be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me: hundred and two
And boy I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

[Pre-Hook]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's going to leave with me when I do
(I do)
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick on YouTube
(You Tube)
Because if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Because they be all up in my bidness like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I

[Hook]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just want to make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Verse 2]
Boy you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in the Caribbean Sea

[Pre-Hook]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's going to leave with me when I do
(I do)
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick on YouTube
(You Tube)
Because if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Because they be all up in my bidness like a Wendy Interview
But this is private, between you and I

[Hook]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just want to make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Bridge]
I am going to treat you like a teddy bear
You won't want to go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Laying intertwined with me
You won't want for nothing, boy
I will give you plenty

[Hook]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just want to make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body
Touch my body
Touch my body
Touch my body
Touch my body
Touch my body



[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
It's like our first date
Time past fast, like the flash of a blink
A little Chardonnay, lingerie and a mink
All I could think (Uh, uh, you're beautiful)
So don't complain when I'm in home late
A couple loose lips and the ship gon' sink
Don't even try to act like your shit don't stink
But still... ASAP!
Hold up wait, hit both brakes
Fuck third base 'cus I hit home plate
I'mma party hard like the disco days
Fat black plaques and them french fold braid
Cause homie pack steel, like below waist
Shawty got grill, like Chipotle
Now my favorite meal be the shrimp lo mein
But still... (You're beautiful)

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby do it again

[Hook: Miguel]
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere
‘Cause it’s beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

[Hook: Miguel & Mariah Carey]

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You don’t know what you’re doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don’t you worry darling

[Hook]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in

[Hook]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 2]
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel, we'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care, don't over prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think know the way but, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go

[Intro]
God?

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus 1]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus 1]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

You whisper softly to me
You're in control

Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus 1][x2]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
If you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You're so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress!
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles, all of those
Standing in the front row

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
If you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Bridge: Madonna]
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my life
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a...
(I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a...)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & (Madonna)]
Shots fire!
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire!
You don't hear them bums on nothing, that's fire! Tell 'em, "catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, Nicki?)
Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
In that, yeah Gabbana, and the ah, yeah! Prada!
We Material Girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar!
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a F you, curse nor bless you
Never let them stress you, yo
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
If you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
There's only one queen and that's Madonna
Bitch!



[Intro: Nas]
Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 2: Madonna]
(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (music saved my life)

[Chorus]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 3: Nas]
In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trappers, any rapper
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses keep a man in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

[Chorus]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Outro: Nas]
Madonna on the track
Nas in the back



[Hook]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I see you coming and I don’t wanna know your name
(L-U-V, Madonna)
I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Would you like to try?
Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you’ll do fine as long as you don’t lie to me
And pretend to be what you’re not

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let’s forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Hook]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Keep trying don’t give up, that’s if you want it bad enough
(L-U-V, Madonna)
It’s right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine
Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let’s forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Give me all your love boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
I'm Roman
I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, im goin' in

[Bridge: Madonna & (Nicki Minaj)]
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (now move!)
Now it’s up to Y-O-U
Are you the one? Shall we proceed?

[Verse 4: M.I.A.]
Move, it! Licks
I’m some swag shit
No one gives you this
It’s super sonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break ‘em off tricks
Let’s pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give me all your love and give me your love
(L-U-V, Madonna)
Give me all your love and give me your love
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let’s forget about time
And dance our lives away

Cómo puede ser verdad

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Outro]
Te dijo te amo
El dijo que te ama



[Intro: Mike Tyson]
I'm the best the world has ever seen. (I'm the best ever!) I'm somebody you'll never forget cause I work hard and sweat in my tears. (Can't be stopped!) I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back

Yeah Iconic, Iconic Yeah

[Verse 1: Madonna]
If you tried and failed, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead

[Verse 2: Madonna]
What you want is just within your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Drop: Madonna]
Iconic

Ironic

[Verse 3: Madonna]
Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great
Say I have to fight and I can't wait (yeah)
Standing in the wings, a butterfly that stings
I will rise above cause it's my fate(yeah)

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Bridge: Madonna]
Born to be a superstar, that's exactly what you are
Born to be a superstar, that's exactly what you are

[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]
Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue
Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

[Verse 1]
It's not Jay-Z and Beyoncé
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope and Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden Calf

[Pre-Chorus]
The All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
The All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, the secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Verse 2]
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix
Pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the Google of United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you'd love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
The All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
The All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, the secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 2]
You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
Come on, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Breakdown]
It's like
It's like
It's like, everybody in this party shining like illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like illuminati

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Outro]
Everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati



[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
Rocket man! Rocket man!

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone

[Outro]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time



[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus Freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

[Verse 3]
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Verse 1 coda]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today



[Verse 1]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets



[Verse 1-Elton John]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2-Elton John]
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus-Elton John]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3-Elton John]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

[Verse 4-Elton John]
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus-Elton John]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


[Outro-Elton John]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world



[Verse 1]
When are you going to come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
Because he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spends his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

[Bridge]
He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day
When the New York Times said
God is dead and the War's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Verse 2]
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly

And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

[Bridge]
He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day
When the New York Times said
God is dead and the War's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Outro]
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did



[Chorus 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Verse 1]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Chorus 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight



[Verse 1]
I've figured out where I went wrong
The script not followed then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not acting up
I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

[Chorus]
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was living in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Verse 2]
Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back

[Chorus]
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was living in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Bridge]
You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

[Chorus]
I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was living in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was living in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Outro]
Looking up
Looking up
Looking up
Looking up

[Interlude]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 1]
Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 2]
He wear no shoeshine, he's got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Verse 3]
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He's got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me
Right!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 1]
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

[Verse 2]
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob

[Verse 3]
Mister City, policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

[Verse 4]
Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob

[Verse 5]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made to tame fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob

[Verse 6]
Expert textpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

[Verse 7]
Semolina pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo good job goo goo goo good job
Goo goo goo joob g'goo goo goo joob goo goo

[Outro]
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”



[Verse 1]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

[Verse 3]
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

[Verse 4]
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in, Hey Jude)
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 5]
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

[Verse 6]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

[Outro]
Na na na na na, na na na, hey Jude
Na na na na na, na na na, hey Jude...



[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
But nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

{alarm clock rings}

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro]



[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus x3]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh



[Verse 1 (Lead vocals: Paul McCartney)]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
"Let it be"
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
"Let it be"

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be



[Chorus]
Let me take you down, because I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, because I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, because I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, because I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Outro]
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?



[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva...



[Verse 1]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2]
I need a fix because I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix because I'm going down
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Verse 3]
Happiness (is a warm gun)
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot
Happiness (is a warm gun, momma)
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot

[Outro]
When I hold you in my arms
And when I feel my finger on your trigger
I know nobody can do me no harm
Because:

Happiness is a warm gun momma
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
Well don't you know that happiness is a warm gun momma?



[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You were struck down, it was your doom

[Bridge]
You've been hit by; you've been hit by - A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues, left behind him
And they have no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?

You were struck down, it was your doom, Annie

*Breaking glass, whistling and snapping*
Oooouuuu

So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Kids]
Wooo, that's cool, huh?
I taught him everything he knows
Oh, yeah, right, you show me
Okay, sure, hold this

[Outro]
Annie are you okay, I don't know
Will you tell us that you're okay, I don't know
There's a sound at the window, I don't know
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie, I don't know
He came into your apartment, I don't know
Left bloodstains on the carpet, I don't know why baby
And then you ran into the bedroom, help me
You were struck down, it was your doom Annie, daggonit

Annie are you okay, daggonit baby
Will you tell us that you're okay, daggonit baby

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says she is the one
She says I am the one

[Outro]
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover



[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody gone mad

[Hook]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me

[Hook]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Bridge 1]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
You're rippin' me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black male, black mail
Throw your brother in jail

[Hook]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Bridge 2]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
They're throwin' me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I do really hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

[Hook]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Verse 5]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be
Skin head, dead head
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, strike me
Don't you wrong or right me

[Hook]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us



[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya see
Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

[Bridge]
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
Cause when you close your heart
Then you close your mind

[Outro]
Make that change!



[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Diana, Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana

[Verse 3]
She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Diana, Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana



EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
ELVIS PRESLEY! VS! MICHAEL JACKSON!
BEGIN!

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Oooh, Elvis Presley as I live and breathe
You stole rock and roll, gave us rockabilly cheese
You dance like an epileptic: Nothing but left feet, I've seen it
Every record you set, man, I beat it
Here’s a tip: Don’t swallow a bucket of drugs
So you won’t die on the toilet dropping hunks of Burning Love
I’m Bad, I’m a Smooth Criminal better face up
Call me Ed Sullivan, shoot you from the waist up
Watch me moonwalk and I step on your blue suede
Even in death I go platinum on Blu-Ray
Spitting out hits since I was six years old
I’m the King of Pop, you’re the King of Jelly Rolls

[Verse 2: Elvis Presley]
Well I died on the shitter but I don’t give a crap
You ain’t got half the badass battle raps that I have
I got one for your monkey, two for your clothes
Three for your family and four for your nose
You better surrender talkin’ about them ABC’s
Cause all you wanna do is teach kids the birds and the bees
This is the big time, Jacko, no dress rehearsal
I’ll light you up like your hair in a Pepsi commercial
I can tell you’re angry but I can’t comprehend it
I stole from black culture, why are you offended?
Your Daddy beat gold records out of you like alchemy
Don’t make me spank you and dangle your ass over a balcony!

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
Ohhh, It’s about time for a Thriller
Didn’t lose any chocolate, I just added vanilla
I’m going Off The Wall, I won’t stop ’til I get enough
Whooping your big fat ass with my shiny glove
How you gonna talk about the birds and bees
When you met your own wife when she was only 14
Then you made one daughter, she (Ah) came to me
I took her to my Neverland Ranch to Hee-Hee
You shoulda stayed in the army dude, (Shamone)
Even Tito looks better than you
I’m singing Aaaahhhhhh, you’re singing Don’t be Cruel
There’s only one crown baby, let the one King rule

[Verse 4: Elvis Presley]
You’re a creeper dude, you like to grab your own wanger
I only let you marry my daughter cause I knew you’d never bang her
You think you’re tough? Man, you look like Tootie
I was badder than you in my Blue Hawaii movie
You lost your damn mind, that’s why they cast you in The Wiz
You’re like a sad white woman who never got to be a kid
I’m out before you try to hold me and free your willy
Later weirdo; Elvis is leaving the building!

WHO WON? WHO'S NEXT? YOU DECIDE!
EPIC (HEE-HEE) RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Hook]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Hook]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Hook]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way



[Verse 1]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
We will get low

[Verse 2]
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose
You know it's alright, it's OK
I'll live to see another day
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

[Bridge]
Life’s goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

[Verse 1]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try, to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

[Outro]
Life’s goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life’s goin' nowhere, somebody help me

I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive



[Verse 1]
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

[Bridge]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

[Chorus]
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Verse 2]
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

[Chorus]
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Outro]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me



[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you? Hey babe

[Chorus]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind
I'm a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe

[Chorus]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus: Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
(Noo noo no-no nooo nooooo)

[Outro]
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you



I started a joke, which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no
I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said
Til I finally died, which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me [x2]



[Pre-Chorus]
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

[Chorus]
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead

[Chorus]
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

[Chorus]
Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones



{Intro}
Here I lie
In a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time
In a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home
I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving you

{Hook}
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're
Goin' nowhere

{Bridge}
Night and day
There's a burning down inside of me
Burning love
With a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go
And I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you, loving

{Outro}
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're
Goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're
Goin' nowhere

Tragedy



[Hook:  Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
You're my life

Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
When you are to me, the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by

You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

[Hook] [x2] [Barry (with falsetto), Robin & Maurice Gibb]

It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

My shooters come for free, so

[Refrain: Chance The Rapper & Lil Wayne]
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!

[Chorus 1 (Extended): Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

[Chorus 1 (Extended): Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1 (Extended): Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard

All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Niggas please be focused - that Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
'Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes, and shows, and chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Hook: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said, "Come to papa", she said, "Papa, yes"

I got that mmm, mmm

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'mma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map with a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack, and a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop

And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

You can't even speak (IGH!)
Damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you, if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus

I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Hook]
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IGH!

[Intro]
Chance's "NaNa" ad-lib

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away



[Hook: Jamila Woods + Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Hook: Jamila Woods +  Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
( the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
(Good God)

[Hook: Jamila Woods, Byron Cage + Chance The Rapper)]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up,  (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Mmm, IGH!
Acid Rap!

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Who smokin' in my car? it's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett,  AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end, I got some folks in C-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino, I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino, that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with cheese, and a Kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her, cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, that's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam, that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum, that's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square, that's a fuckin' rhombus

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Who's sneaking in the club? that's that young Sir Rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art

[Hook]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Soulo hoe hoe twerk somethin'
Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin'
My name Herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Look, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo (IGH!)
Them niggas pissed, need potty training
They movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came
We kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again

[Chorus 1]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1]
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus 2]
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus 3: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Outro: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion



[Intro]
Ooooh oooh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooooh oooh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard
At each other like we going to war
You and I go rough
We keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so
Damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score
You and I get sick
Yeah I know that we can't do this no more

[Hook]
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you 'No'
But my body keeps on telling you 'Yes'
Try to tell you stop
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I be waking up
In the morning probably hating myself
And I be waking up
Feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

[Hook]
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Bridge]
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night

[Hook]
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo yeah
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

(Yeah baby give me one more night)

[Verse 3]
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah baby give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who‘s taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so

And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

And every time I go out, yeah

Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?

My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
(Oh hey)
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home

[Intro]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

[Pre-Hook]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down

[Pre-Hook]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pull up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone



[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna' stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but the way your ass used to be you gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So cold, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold



[Verse 1]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

[Pre-Hook]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
Now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

[Pre-Hook]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Bridge]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love

[Bridge]
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
Cause girl you're hotter than a Southern California day
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy

Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?



[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Outro fading out]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye



[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1]
So what you trying to do to me?
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lies, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Breakdown]
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lies, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah



[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

[Bridge]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song I'll be sick

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down

[Bridge]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone...

[Bridge]
Now baby dont hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby im begging just please dont go
So I can tell you what you need to know

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone... Explain



[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Bridge]
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Whoo!)
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
(Ohh)
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker



[Chorus: will.i.am]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

[Verse 1: will.i.am (Jamie Foxx & Mary J. Blige)]
Yo, what's going on with the world, momma?
(Where's the love)
Yo, people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and attracted to the trauma, mama
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or the meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

[Verse 2: Diddy (Mary J. Blige & Cassie)]
Overseas, yeah, they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets, the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind, just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate to the love
So the whole world celebrate it

[Chorus: will.i.am, Mary J. Blige, Andra Day, Nicole Scherzinger & Tori Kelly]
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can't we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

[Verse 4: Taboo (Jessie J & Andra Day)]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)

[Verse 5: Game]
Where's the love when a child gets murdered, or a cop gets knocked down?
Black lives, not now
Everybody matter to me, all races
Y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody, guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart, why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

[Verse 6: Taboo + Ty Dolla $ign (Mary J. Blige & Jessie J)]
Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth, then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love, then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love, where's the love)

[Bridge: DJ Khaled (Usher, Nicole Scherzinger, will.i.am & Justin Timberlake)]
Love is the key
(Where's the love)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love)

[Verse 7: A$AP Rocky + Jaden Smith]
My mama asked me why I never vote, never vote
Cause police men want me dead and gone, dead and gone
That election looking like a joke, such a joke, man
And the weed man still sellin' dope, oh no
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope, give us hope
All he ever wanted was a smoke, my gosh
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke

[Verse 8: apl.de.ap + Fergie]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)



[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all

[Pre-Hook: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear 'em cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Hook: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: Apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

[Outro]
Now sing with me, y'all (one world, one world)
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)
And something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with the w-w-world
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)

Looking at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it
If you touch it, I'mma

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same

It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite

[Hook: Fergie]
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

[Post-Hook: will.i.am]
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

[Verse 1: will.i.am + (Fergie)]
Honey got her sexy on steaming
She's give my hotness a new meaning
Perfection, mami you gleaming
Inception, you got a brother dreaming, dreaming
Damn, baby, I'm fiendin
I'm tryna holla at you, I'm screaming
Let me love you down this evening
(Lovie lovie, yeah, you know you are my demon)
Girl, we can form a team, and
I could be the King, you could be the Queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleaning
(I love you long time so you know the meaning)

[Pre-Hook: will.i.am]
Oh baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

[Hook: Fergie]
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signs her name on my heart with an "XO"
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime, I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm...
Something 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin down, yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin like Mr. Roboto​

[Pre-Hook: will.i.am]
Oh baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

[Breakdown: apl.de.ap]
This, has been a switch-up
Switch-up, switch-up
I just can't - switch-up

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Locked, sunk in your bedrock
Heart, pumpin' your love-shot
Knocked, out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your headlock (switchup)
Can't stop, won't quit
Makin' me fiend, give it to me
I want it all, you know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (switchup)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (switchup)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory

[Outro: apl.de.ap]
I just can't - switch-up



[Hook]
I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

[Post-Hook]
Tonight's that night
Let's live it up
I got my money
Let's spend it up
Go out and smash it
Like, "Oh my God!"
Jump out that sofa
Let's kick it
Off!

[Verse 1]
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down, and go out, and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losing all control

[Refrain]
Fill up my cup
Mazel tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off!
Let's paint the town
We'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof

[Refrain 2]
And then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it, and do it (let's live it up)
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

[Hook]
Cause I got a feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

[Hook: will.i.am]
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
Yesterday

[Verse 1: Taboo, will.i.am and apl.de.ap]
We going back to the front, give them what they want
Back to the past, retro glass
Back to the leader, back to reviews
Take them back to the future
Take them to the true school
Cause we was breaking atoms, live at the barbeque
Now we reminiscing, pumping Audio Two
Listening to niggas, niggas with them attitudes
Apl with some Black Sheep screaming
"You can get with this or you can get with that"
Smoke emcees, or you could smoke crack
You can sell dope, or you can sell raps
I sell dope raps cause that's where it's at
Now I'm back on the scene, crispy and clean hip hop fiend
Source Magazine, World Famous is the Supreme Team
SP-1200 drum machine, hail to Latifah she be the queen
DMC and Run be the kings, king of rock
My nigga Ice-T killed a cop
And we be to rap what key be to lock

[Interlude: will.i.am and apl.de.ap]
I'm cool like that, I'm cool like that
I move like that because I'm smooth like that
I rap like that because I'm phat like that
I rock like that because I got it like that
And I'm ill like that, skilled like that
Phil-i-ppines, cause I feel like that
I'm real like that, yes, I'm chill like that
He gots the chill

[Verse 2: will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap]
I got pounds and pounds of peas you knowI'm not Large Professor but I'm an extra pro
Punks jump up to punk rock'n'roll
The Master P-nut is a pistachio
The Peas peak past the pinnacle plateau
Posses a fresh Porsche, I don't push Peugeot
Packing out paper in a pass I was pulled
Get paid to rock mics and used to call the show
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
Check the flow yo, cause this retro
It's my classic mani-fucking-festo
Lyrically I'm magic, fucking presto
Insuring hip-hop like gecko
Making sure it won't stop, baby, heck no
That's a what, that's a what, the scenario
Reminiscing while I listen to the stereo

[Interlude: will.i.am]
I reminisce, I reminisce
I reminisce, I reminisce
When it's sounding like this

[Hook: will.i.am]
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to rappable
Cause oh baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Oh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw

[Verse 3: will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yey
Comment allez-vous, parlez vous francais?Adiós, motherfuckers, bon voyage
Home of the liquid flows and Liquid Swords
Black eyed killer peas on the swarm
Coming to your college and disco dorm
Y'all can't touch my skills
I can switch it up Das Efx and get iggity-iggity-ill
Yiggity-yes rapper, my style is unique
Iggity ice on my teeth slazaro it's cold when I speak
Word to mom, I'm in my own world
Galaxy rays, powerful

[Hook: will.i.am]
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday

[Verse 4: Taboo, apl.de.ap and will.i.am]
So I can hit you with the bass, how low can you go?
I get lower than the midget doing limbo
I got shit that you haven't heard a while ago
'88-'92 the style'll go, way back, rocking on the A-track
Memorex, TDK, all of that, throw back before all the  Nazareth
Willy is his name and the boy's coming, Straight Out of L.A
A crazy motherfucker named Willy
I'm so cold my flow stay chillyI got a laser aimed at them haters
And I'm cutting motherfuckers with my razor
You too boy, if you fuck with me
I'mma dice you up, slice you up quickly
I signed to Ruthless when Dre dropped Dre Day
That's why I do this, to bring you back to yesterday
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday) Tiger style
There's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom, bam, I slam
Aw, man, you fucking with will.i.am
Cause I'm torching and scorching, my style is awesome
Cracking motherfuckers' skulls like it's porcelain
Ay yo, let's save hip hop from Dr. Kevorkian
Bring it right here, right back to its origin
Ay yo, I'mma hop in my motherfucking DeLorean
So I can go back and fucking perform again
Ay yo, I did some windmills on some fucking linoleum
MC mic controlling them, I was like (woop-woop)
I was steady policing them
Killing emcees, I was straight deceasing them (woop-woop)
Compute-deleting them 'til them niggas don't exist
Because Black Eyes Peas is hard as hell
Battle anybody, I don't care if you tell
I excel, they all fail, I told them motherfuckers I'mma take them...

[Outro: will.i.am]
Back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
And now I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
Taking you to the future
Take you to the future
Take you to the future
Future, future, future, future, future...



[Intro: Fergie]
Ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Cool, I spend my time just thinking
Thinking, thinking 'bout you

Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up, it used, to used to be just me and you

I want you so bad, it's my only wish

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe and go to other galaxies

I travel uptown, town I travel downtown
Wanna have you around, 'round like every single day
I love you always, ways I'll meet you halfway

[Chorus: Fergie]
Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline

For you and I (For you and I)
For for for you and I
For for for for you and I
For for you and I (For you and I)

[Breakdown: Fergie]
Can you meet me halfway?

Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?

[Chorus: Fergie]
Meet me halfway
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin, and runnin', runnin'
And

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull the heat out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burnin' 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from North West East South

Lose control, up outta your soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like you're into New Kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we move it

[Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]

Ap the gate, and Will bring the thugged out drill (just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (just)

Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
You mind pass normal or another head trip

[Verse 1: Pink]
Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh Oh
Things you never say to me
Oh Oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Chorus: Pink]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess (and Pink)]
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
Yeah but this is happening
You've been having real bad dreams
Oh oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love

[Pink & Nate Ruess]
“Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
[Nate Ruess]
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
[Pink & Nate Ruess]
You’re not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: Nate Ruess and Pink]
Oh tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Outro: Both]
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again



[Verse 1]
I know that I am runnin' out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

[Verse 2]
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Verse 3]
So look, I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come uh, come uh with me
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmmm, what's a girl to do?

[Bridge: Acoustic]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

[Outro]
Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
Run it, run it, run it



[Intro]
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

[Break]
Eh, eh, eh

[Verse 1]
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

[Verse 2]
Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

[Outro]
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try



[Verse 1]
Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that is alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss “no way it is all good”
It did not slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I am still around

[Hook]
Pretty, pretty please
Do not you ever, ever feel
Like you are less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you are nothing, you are fucking perfect to me

[Verse 2]
You are so mean when you talk
About yourself, you are wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead

So complicated, look how big you will make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It is enough, I have done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I have seen you do the same

[Hook]

[Bridge]
The whole world is scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it is a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, because they are everywhere
They do not like my jeans, they do not get my hair
Estrange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
(Why do I do that?)

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Trying to hold, trying to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 3]
I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe
I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the "why"s will be crystal clear

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Chorus]
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss



[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling, like a siren (oh oh)
We don't, want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 1: P!nk]
I just wanna play
Big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know
What's better for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling, like a siren (oh oh)
We don't, look for trouble
Just enough to, see in double

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
Fuck what they say
Let's run the floor
Until it breaks

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling, like a siren (oh oh)
We don't, look for trouble
Just enough to, see in double

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nothing high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
Im prob-ably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly
Or Ciroc, I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run the city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a fricking idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights
Little indignity, hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you
I'll knock your dick in the dirt, bickering worse
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel, hanging from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building
Cause we're tearing it down, security get out
The fricking way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it’s loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going AH AH AH AH cause

[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

(Oh oh)

Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)



[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. President, come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and you're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

[Chorus]
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

[Verse 2]
Dear Mr. President, were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy? Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say, "No child is left behind"?
We're not dumb and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

[Chorus]
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?



[Verse 1]
I've spent enough time alone
Up in my bedroom at home
Been kinda bored lately
I hate on all I see
It's all mundane to me
This box I painted pains me
But you could watch me
You could help me down the rabbit hole with you
I could go with you
You could lead the way I'd go hand in hand with you

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Today's the day I've been waiting for
Tomorrow won't come after all
Yesterday is so far away
And today is the only day
Somebody please stop the clock
Oh oh oh
Don't ever let this day stop
Oh oh oh
I never wanna go home
No no no oh oh oh
No no no
No no no no no
Oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I used to want to grow up
I thought that I could be free
But now I'm realizing
It's cool, it ain't for me
It's cool, 'cause all my dreams
Are more than possibilities
I get so vicious
When I don't feel delicious
I just need a friend
So much to carry
These days are kinda scary I don't want the fun to end

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Today's the day I've been waiting for
Tomorrow won't come after all
Yesterday is so far away
And today is the only day
Somebody please stop the clock
Oh oh oh
Don't ever let this day stop
Oh oh oh
I never wanna go home
No no no
No no no
No no no no no no no
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

[Bridge]
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way

I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Today's the day I've been waiting for
Tomorrow won't come after all
Yesterday is so far away
And today is the only day
Somebody please stop the clock
Oh oh oh
Don't ever let this day stop
Oh oh oh
I never wanna go home
No no no oh oh oh

I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say today's my day
I'mma say it's gonna go my way



[Verse 1]
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you

[Pre-Chorus]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Verse 3]
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once please try not to be so mean
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on I'll say it slowly (Romance)
You can do it baby!

[Pre-Chorus]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Interlude]
I think it must be love
I think it must be love

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete

[Chorus]
I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you



[Chorus]
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started

[Verse 1]
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lot of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started

[Verse 2]
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruising through the west side
We'll be checking the scene
Boulevard is freaking as I'm coming up fast
I'll be burning rubber, you'll be kissing my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says Stunner #1 Superstar

[Chorus]
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
Get this party started

[Verse 3]
Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chilling as I set up the groove
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

[Chorus]
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
Get this party started
Get this party started right now
Get this party started
Get this party started
Get this party started right now

[Verse 1]
I remember them days when I used to hang in the club
So addicted to fame they say it's the same as a drug
Not a lame or a scrub no that ain't what it was
Knew this girl is somebody else's, i think i'm in love
She know she bad, but what's new
Maybe the baddest, I want you girl

Cuz, we catching feelin's fa sho
You know the game and you know how it go

Nobodies hurt if nobody knows

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms have come and gone
Leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray, all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo the many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope
Is for the folk who can't cope with such an enduring pain
That it keeps them in the pouring rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast



[Chilli]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

[Hook: Chilli]
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know he can not approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass

[Hook: Chilli]
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Bridge]
If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, no scrub
No scrub, no scrub

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising
And if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of over seas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition
From your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really want to know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really
T-Boz and all my senoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's
But you don't hear me, though

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
[Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
[Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me]



[Intro]
Yes it's me again
And I'm back
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only cause I need some affection

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'
Cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
(I think about us baby all the time)
Said nobody is supposed to know
(But you know that I'm gonna need some attention, yeah, yeah)
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
(Love you forever, baby, soul and mind)
And no attention goes to show, oh
(And you gotta know it, if you don't give it, I'm gonna get mine)

[Bridge]
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, yeah
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, yeah
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, baby
Oh I oh I oh I, yeah

[Outro]
So I creep, yeah

I just keep it on the down low
(Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
(I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)

So I creep, yeah, I just keep it on the down low
(Oh I oh I oh I, yeah, oh I oh I oh I)
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
(Oh I oh I oh I, yeah, oh I oh I oh I)

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention, goes to show oh so I creep



[Intro]
This goes out to forever
Through sunshine or the rainiest weather
And no matter what it will always be us together

[Verse 1]
I said if I got nothing else
I got memories of what we felt
I sit ah laughing to myself
Sometimes, about it
Those silly reasons we would fight
No matter who was wrong or right
We were always right there
Sharing this love, sharing this life

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we knew, said we always knew
That no matter what would occur
That we were
Meant to be

[Chorus]
And it ain't going to be easy
But no matter what baby we're meant to be
And we ain’t never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

[Verse 2]
And though it will get dark sometimes we know
Every now and then it's got to rain
But when that rain starts to pound
All you gotta do is turn around
And you'll find me right there
Holding you up, holding you down

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
From the moment we met
Meant to be
Through the sorrow, through the stress
Meant to be through life and through death
Hey we've built a love that nothing can test
Meant to be

[Chorus x3]

[Outro]
Always
Meant to be
Yeah



[Produced by Dallas Austin]

[T-Boz]
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Chilli]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

[Hook]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So damn unpretty

I'll make you feel unpretty too

[T-Boz]
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, yeah

[Chilli]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin'

[Hook x2]

And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty

[Hook]



[Intro]
Fresh out the box
Stop, look, and watch
Ready yet, get set
It's All That!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
This is All That
This is All That!

[Verse]
Check it, check it, check it
Now this is just an introduction
Before I blow your mind
The show is All of That and yes we do it all the time

Ground or in the air

It's all of that!
So sit still cause we're coming right back

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh

This is All That!



[Intro]
Also known as a busta

[Verse 1]
Fuck it, I admit it, I did it to get it
I wrote you a song and then did you wrong
I hit it and quit it, forget that I did it
You'll probably call me a busta by the end of this song
But I ain't gon' act like there wasn't a time when I wasn't that guy
And you treated me like a nigga that's just on the passenger side
You and girls were screamin' that y'all dont wan't no scrubs
I was the nigga that wanted you but ain't get no love
Then I made a decision, I'm with it, it's wrriten
When I catch you slippin', I'm gon' do you wrong
So I done came up now, I got my cake up now
But I cannot forget all the times you used to say to me

[Hook]
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

[Verse 2]
You see I was the nigga that was all on the side of his best friend's ride
See my pockets were thinner and my dollars were slimmer
When I asked for your digits, you simply replied, "No scrubs"
So I finally waited, I waited for you
Plottin' the way I'm gon' do it and waitin' for you to fall trough
I pulled up on you in that rental but you tought that shit was mine
And that's when you came up and gave me your number, it's sick just to know
But I ain't playin' timid, it's guaranteed that we did it
The first night I came over, she had me in her room
And all that I'm thinkin' is look what a car can do
Look at me gettin' you outside your pants and you used to say

[Hook]
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

[Outro]
Fuck it, let's take this shit deeper, back to the day that I seen ya
First time we fucked, you knew I was schemin'
You knew I was leavin', so who's to believe in?
You're back with a vengeance, I was a brand new Beemer
You bust the windows out my car ,fuckin' you
Jasmine Sullivan attitude, Jimmy Choo's, gettin' rude
Eyes attitude passin' by with your different dudes, different crews
Used to see shit eye to eye, we got different views, different views



[Intro]
What, what about your friends
What about
What about your friends
What about your
What about your
What about your

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

[Chorus]
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Verse 2: Left Eye]
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

[Verse 3: T-Boz]
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friends is true they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

[Chorus]
What about your friends (What about your friends)
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again (let you down again)
What about your friends are they gonna be low down (What about your friends)
Will they ever be around (be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Verse 4: Left Eye]
Yo is it me, here we go
Is it me or can it be I am a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

[Chorus]
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground, yeah
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down (What about your friends)
Will they ever be around (be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Verse 5: Chili]
People say I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me yeah yeah (What about your friends)
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

[Chorus]
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down (What about your friends are they gonna be low down)
Will they ever be around (Will they ever be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you (Or will they turn their backs on you)
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around



[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Take a good look at it, look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a good round
I'll let you touch it if you'd like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route
Don't go too fast, don't go too slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control

[Chorus]
Baby it's yours, I'm yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I know that you want me
I can see it in your eyes
You might as well be honest
Cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll, I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast just let me know
Cause it means you move too slow
I like some excitement and I like a man that goes

[Chorus]
Baby it's yours, I'm yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

[Bridge: Chilli]
If you want me let me know it
I'll make time but you've got to show it
If you need me, I want to see
But don't mistake me
I don't want you down on your knees
I need someone, a real man
I need someone who understands
I'm a woman, a real woman
I know just what I want
I know just who I am

[Chorus]
Baby it's yours, I'm yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

Baby it's yours, I'm yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

Models roll my indo, I beat the pussy, Django
Them niggas talking money, I got more digits in my gate code
She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus
You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focused

Okay, haters throw fitted never showed up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz...
Velcro, I'm sticking to it, hatin', I've been a victim to it

Live it up and count my dividends, roll, like cinnamon
Woah, big face Benjamin's
As she lookin' at me like ye'en ain't nothin' but a star
I looked at her like this ain't nonthing but a car
If you ride with them you ain't going that far
But if you ride with me, crib so big we can play hide-and-seek
You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat
Pilot seat, I need a co-pilot, kiss a ass in both mouths
Them talking both lips, what you know 'bout boat trips?
Drop her ass at the Chocolate Factory (yeah)
We did them 12 Play's (yeah)
And you know who you is girl
We been fuckin' since the 12th grade, goddamn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Pull up to the club at about three
I'm killin' it, guilty no plea
I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece
By 9 o'clock, we on round three
I speak of rain they say I'm crazy like they didn't know
See I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar
Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes
Showed her the Jesus piece now she got the Holy Ghost
They asked them in a interview, "why do he love these girls?"
The only thing he had to say was, "motherfuck the world!"

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Let's wake up, it's dinner time, turn up
Pull up to the crib and a nigga on silk, come fuck with a nigga

[Intro]
My mind is telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess (chill)

No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my door
You'll never feel another love you see

[Pre-Hook]
You need someone
Someone like me (girl)
To make love to you baby constantly
You need someone
Someone like me (girl)
To make love to you baby constantly

See I met her at this party in Atlanta
Well I met her at this party in Chicago
She came right up to me, giving me conversation
I said "Do you got a man?"
She said "No" with no hesitation
Well, it must be a music thing
Cause she said the same to me
At party all in my face
While I'm laughing and buying her drinks
She whispered in my ear, said "Can you take me home?"
Me too, man, she was in the Chi singing that same song
Is that true?
And I thought it was true confessions when she said "I love you"
Man I thought her body was calling when she said "I want you"
Look I even got some pictures on my phone
Looky there, there she is with some boy shorts on

Are you talking about the pink phone?
Mmm mmm, the blue one
Man, she told me that was turned off

Cause constantly she's been lying to us, lying to us
Don't like the way that she's been going 'bout, going 'bout
Kells, what you think that we should do about it, about it?
Call her up at her home
She won't know I'm on the phone
Yeah, man, that's the way

Feelin’ like we on a movie set

Make me dribble like CP3, but I rep that DTP
So if you gimme that, I’mma give you that
One leg up over my shoulder

Let me try to keep my composure
So many different ways that I can fold ya
Oh yea I go to town girl
You should keep me around (oohhh)
Cause every night I’m goin’

[Hook] + [Bridge x3]

[Outro]
So uhh
What'chu think about that? Hahahah
Yeah, I thought you would
No I like it too, it’s cool



7 o'clock in the morning and the rays from the sun wake me up
I'm stretching and yawning in a bed that don’t belong to me
Then a voice yells “good morning darling” from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me and to my surprise she isn’t you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like “what have I done”?
How could I be so stupid to have been laid in to the morning sun
Must have lost the track of time, oh what was on my mind?
From the club went to her home, didn’t plan to stay that long
Here I am quickly trying to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys trying to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of me
Said “you can’t go this way”
Looked at her like she was crazy
Said “woman move out my way”
I Said “I got a wife at home”
She said “please don’t go out there”
“Lady I’ve got to get home”
She said her husband was coming from the stairs
“Shh shh quiet, hurry up and get in the closet”
She said “don’t you make a sound or some shit is going down"
I said “why don’t I just go out the window”
“Yes, except for one thing, we’re on the 5th floor”
Shit, think, shit, think, shit… “quick put me in the closet”
And now I'm in this darkest closet trying to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells “I’m home”
She says “honey I'm in the room”
He walks in there with a smile on his face saying “honey I've been missing you”
She hops all over him and says “I've cooked and ran your bathwater”
I'm telling you now this girl is so good she deserves an Oscar
The girl’s in the bed he starts snatching her clothes off
I'm in the closet like man, "what the fuck is going on?"
You’re not going to believe it but things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said “there’s a mystery going on and I'm going to solve it”
And I'm like “God please don’t let this man open his closet”
He walks in the bathroom and looks behind the door
She says “baby come back to bed”
He says “bitch say no more”
He pulls back the shower curtain while she’s biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room. Right now I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed (bed)
Then opens the dresser (dresser)
He looks at the closet (closet)
I pull out my Beretta (Beretta)
He walks up to the closet (closet)
He’s close up to the closet (closet)
Now he’s at the closet (closet)
Now he’s opening the closet (closet, closet, closet)



[Intro: R. Kelly]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Cuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and I'm a flirt

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me, ya dig?...

Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cause you leave ya wife and I see ya wife now be for real
How long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cause you the business type
That's 'til I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang
Sit that right up on that dress, see yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G cause you might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, the McLaren in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
When I, when I, when I...

When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, "Damn twenty-eights"
Then I be like "girl you know just who I am, don't hate"
See I done +Fell in Love with a Stripper+ y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pat
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'mma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass-Down
I be like "Como se llama, lil' mama? Me llamo Pain
What is your name? I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same"
I'mma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
"He's so fly, yes he's so cool"
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad cuz I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad cuz I'm a flirt

[Hook]

[Verse 4: R. Kelly]
Oh, it's, the, re-mix...

Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she lookin' at me then I'm gon' hit
Manjackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club, actin' like you in love
Stuntin' like you all thug, we was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by, you turn your head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling me daddy, I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means? That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the V.I.P cause I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga, it's a playa's field my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
Cause I'mma flirt with her, right, he gon' flirt with her, right
And if she lickin' that good shit, she gon' flirt with her

[Hook]

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Kellz, T.I., T-Pain
Ladies, if your men ain't hittin' it right
Just call the number on the screen
I'll be at your rescue



[R.Kelly talking]
Yo what up, my nigga
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by
Holler at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or something

[Verse 1-R.Kelly]
Nigga, we done been through a lot of shit together
From running these streets to being down for whatever
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to tell you
Things I should've said way back when we was younger
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand
And now I'm tripping on how I really miss you, man
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
It's all good now (My nigga)
We out the hood now (Mmm)
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears
You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni
My nigga and never placed no bitch before me
Man, I swear to God I love you for that shit
Why'd you have to get hit
Where was I, what time was it
You were supposed to get older with me
On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Copping them Range Rovers with me
Sitting onthangs and smoking trees
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place
Sitting here sipping on this Hennessy
Just thinking about how much you meant to me (My nigga)
Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga
Though you made it home I'm still missing you, my nigga
I'm feeling like the timing was wrong, my nigga
I know you're smiling down saying carry on, my nigga
Sometimes my nights can get long, my nigga
Sometimes I feel God did me wrong, my nigga
So I had to write a song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you're still my nigga

[Hook]
I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 2-R.Kelly]
Little son is looking at me like, "Where is my daddy?"
And your 13-year old daughter is mad cause she understands
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helping hands
Damn, I wish your ass was here, my nigga
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my nigga
And we would talk about you getting up out this game
And you would tell me how it keeps calling you name
(We used to ride-ride-ride)
Never afraid to (Die-die-die)
But sometimes we (Cry-cry-cry)
Asking the Lord (Why-why-why)
They're tearing down these projects
We were homies for like 20 thug years (say word)
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears (say word)
You remember when Vibe world premiered
How we used to share the same old gear
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
(It's all good now) My nigga
We out the hood now
It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on"
When I'm dying every second that you're gone
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong
Hoping you said your prayers before you went on home
We done stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze
We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories

Chorus

[Boo]
Uh, uh, yo dog, I can't explain how I miss you
We stayed together, copping cane, poppin pistols
I miss you most
Putting the doo rag over your bean head
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (whoa)
Coming up off the fiends for bags
Running up out the cleanest Jag
You was the closest nigga I had
Look how we stayed aces
Hustled, made big faces
I wish we could trade places
Fuck giving you ice, I'd rather give you life
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh yeah)

[Gotti]
So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holding it down
If you could see me you would say I'm talking soft right now
But it's hard for me to say when I'mma seee you again
And I know it's fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen
But you're died for the love of the dough
The love of the block, 16 you was running the spot
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb
Hanging with wild thug niggas, smoking the herb (Mmm, hmm, hmm)
I'm gonna keep pouring this liquor and that's my word
This here is for niggas that be flipping them birds
(Oh) Word up!

[R.Kelly]
Even though you know you will always be my nigga
(Whoa...whoa...oh...oh)
Even though you're gone you will also be my nigga
I'm feeling like the time when I'm high, my nigga
I'm feeling like the time
I'm strung out, saying "Radio, please don't take the nigga out
This song"
Let it play on, go on, on
So I had to write this song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you're still my nigga



[Intro]
Piece by piece
Piece by piece

[Verse 1]
And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to

[Chorus]
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old
And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

[Verse 2]
And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn’t have anything you needed so I was worthless

[Chorus]
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old
And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me, cause he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

[Bridge]
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece

[Chorus]
Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I’m going to put her first
And you know...
He’ll never walk away
He’ll never break her heart
He’ll take care of things, he’ll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

[Outro]
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece



[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

[Chorus]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Outro]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you



[Verse 1]
There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
Then push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
Feels easier to just swim down
And so they move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

[Chorus]
If you see him in the street walking by himself
Talking to himself, have pity
You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown
He is working through the unimaginable
His hair has gone grey, he passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city
You knock me out, I fall apart
Can you imagine?

[Verse 2]
Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don't deserve you
But hear me out, that would be enough
If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile
And that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
And that would be enough

[Chorus]
If you see him in the street, walking by her side
Talking by her side, have pity
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown
He is trying to do the unimaginable
If you see him walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city
Look around, look around, look around
They are trying to do the unimaginable

[Verse 3]
There are moments that the words don't reach
There's a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we could never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Standing there side by side
She takes his hand
It's quiet uptown
Forgiveness, can you imagine?
Forgiveness, can you imagine?

[Chorus]
If you see him in the street, walking by her side
Talking by her side, have pity
Look around, look around
They are going through the unimaginable



[Intro]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long

[Verse 1]
You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long

[Verse 2]
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I'd have known where I I'd be now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a long time

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long

[Bridge]
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I've ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long



[Verse 1]
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

[Chorus 2]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

[Chorus 2]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Bridge]
Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

[Chorus 2]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Outro]
(When I'm alone)



[Verse 1]
Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

[Verse 2]
You dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I pictured me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

[Chorus]
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you, now I get what I want
Since you been gone

[Verse 2]
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
I guess you never felt that way

[Chorus]
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you, now I get what I want
Since you been gone

[Bridge]
You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

[Chorus - Extended]
Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get, I get what I want
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get, I get what I want
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone



[Verse 1]
You know I was broke down, I had hit the ground
I was crying out, I couldn't make no sound
No one hears the silent tears collecting
You know I had lost hope, I was all alone
Never been so long 'til you came along
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

[Pre-Chorus]
Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
Cause baby, I am ready to be free

[Chorus (With Sia)]
Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
Another perfect storm

[Verse 2]
Now I am a warrior, a shooting star
Know I got this far, had a broken heart
No one hears the silent tears collecting
Cause it's being weak, but strong in the truth I found
I have courage now, gonna shout it out
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

[Pre-Chorus]
Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
Cause baby, I am ready to be free

[Chorus (With Sia)]
Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
Another perfect storm

[Bridge]
I was running from an empty threat
Of emptiness
I was running from an empty threat
That didn't exist
I was running from an empty threat
Of abandonment
I was running from an empty threat
That didn't exist

[Chorus (With Sia)] x 2
Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
Another perfect storm



Da ra ra ra ra
Da ra ra ra ra
Da ra ra ra ra ra ra

Da ra ra ra ra
Da ra ra ra ra
Da ra ra ra ra ra ra

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed I could break away

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

[Verse 3]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

[Verse 4]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

[Outro]
I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway



[Verse 1]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right
We were never meant for do or die

[Interlude]
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hold you, now I can't stop

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on so I'm already gone

[Verse 2]
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry

Started with a perfect kiss then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I love you enough to let you go

[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on so I'm already gone

[Bridge]
Already gone, already gone, already gone
Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

[Verse 3]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on so I'm already gone



[Verse 1]
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

[Chorus]
Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for trying to pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

[Bridge]
Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you
Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you



[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Bridge]
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Hook]
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Bridge]
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Hook]
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Break]
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Hook]
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life

[Verse 3]
Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

[Verse 4]
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do



[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit, tied
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby
‘Cause I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

[Interlude: Timbaland]
Wait a minute. You ready, JT?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And owww, burned myself, but just had to touch it
It's so fire and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watching
‘Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, ‘cause you're all mine
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad
‘Cause, girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my Thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things

Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Get out your seat, Hov!

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
…aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel; Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her ‘cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh!

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey



[Verse 1]
Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins
Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you

And now I'm just a junkie for your love (Break it down)
My heroine, my cocaine, my plum wine, my MDMA

And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Uh, my nicotine, my blue dream, my hydroponic candy jelly bean
Did you fix me up, I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream
Bloodshot eyes, I'm hopped up on it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop up on it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Uh, that pusher love, that's what I call it (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Let me hear you say (pusher love)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)



[Intro: Justin Timberlake (Timbaland)]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
(And all in thrilling, new, living sound)
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn(take out)
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claimin' they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day 1, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the 3 piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO



[Pre-Intro]
In all, enthrilling new, living sound

[Intro: Timbaland]
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo (x5)
Lights out, TKO

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go, cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody’s heart is slow
Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out

Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out

Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe

I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it

[Verse 1]
Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!

[Bridge]
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore

[Hook]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you

[Verse 2]
Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

[Bridge]
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

[Hook]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there

Yeah, a million people in a crowded room

[Intro - Justin Timberlake]
Hi, how ya'll feeling tonight
Thank ya'll for coming out to the the Y's Underground Club
Our first act up
All the way from Memphis, Tennesse
Show him some Southern love, JT and the Tennessee kids
Come on, give it up

[Justin - Justin Timberlake]
Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids
One, two, three!
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1 - Justin Timberlake]
Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say

[Hook - Justin Timberlake]
Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what if you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, she's in love with me

[Verse 2 - Justin Timberlake]
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

[Hook - Justin Timberlake]
Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what if you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, she's in love with me

[Break - Justin Timberlake]
My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

[Bridge - Justin Timberlake]
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
Because they see my number one
My number one girl

[Hook - Justin Timberlake]
I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what if you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me

[Outro - Justin Timberlake]
I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
Cause I'm in love with that girl



[Verse 1]
Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

[Pre-hook]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Hook]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Verse 2]
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

[Hook]



[Intro]
This goes out to you, this is dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
Mellow, mellow, mellow day

[Verse 1]
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I dont know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

[Bridge 1]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Dont worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Hook]
Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please dont change nothing
Because your flavours so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that Strawberry Bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Verse 2]
So tell why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
‘Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl im all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

[Bridge 1]

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
My little Strawberry, Strawberry, Strawberry Bubblegum
My little Strawberry, Strawberry, Strawberry Bubblegum
She's my little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
My little Strawberry, Strawberry, Strawberry Bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
If you’d be strawberry bubblegum
Then I’d be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won’t you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’d be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’d love you ‘til I’ll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I’d be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you’d be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’d be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’d love you 'til I make you pop

[Melody changes]

[Verse 3]
Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you’re delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it’s so sweet
That’s what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah
If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’ll be your blueberry lollipop
If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’ll be your blueberry lollipop
Then I’ll love you ‘til I make it pop
If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’ll be your blueberry lollipop
(little girl would you be my)
If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’ll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’ll love you ‘til I make it pop
Hey, hey, hey
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’ll be your blueberry lollipop
(little girl would you be my)
If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I’ll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’ll love you ‘til I make it pop



[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, come on
We're having too much fun right here

[Verse 1]
She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

[Bridge]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Hook]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 2]
Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I’ll keep a secret for ya

[Bridge]
I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

[Verse 4: Drake]
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

[Hook]

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here



[Verse 1]
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

[Verse 2]
Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

[Bridge]
All you have to do is stay
So stay, yeah

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is stay



[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger?"
"I can go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful



[Verse 1]
Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

[Pre-Chorus]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

[Chorus]
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are

[Verse 2]
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are

[Pre-Chorus]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

[Chorus]
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah

[Bridge]
We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine

[Pre-Chorus]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

[Chorus]
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be alright
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are



[Verse 1]
I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

[Chorus 1]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Post-Chorus]
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Refrain 2]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus 2]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

[Bridge]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go



[Verse 1]
Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I’m beautiful
Cause I wasn’t looking for love no
Nobody asked you to get me attached to you
In fact you tricked me
And I wasn’t trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that I’m asking
Is that you handle me with caution
Cause I don’t give myself often
But I guess I’ll try today

[Chorus]
Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

[Verse 2]
I’m mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What’s wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, ohh
And I wasn’t trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn’t scared to fall again
But if you promise me you’ll catch me
Then it’s okay

[Chorus]
Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours

[Bridge]
Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming til I see you again
I’m not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I’m
Falling again
Falling again

[Chorus]
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours



[Intro]
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 1]
My daddy says that life comes at you fast
We all like blades of grass
We come to prime and in time we just wither away
And it all changes
My view with a looking glass won’t catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
See I recall being afraid of the dark
And holding on to teddy bears
I’d wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now I’m here
And the night is mine

[Chorus]
So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait 'til I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

[Verse 2]
My mother said don’t forget where you come from, where you’ve been
Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away
They keep you grounded
Oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
And yeah I guess that sounded nice when I was ten
Oh but never were there truer words
In all my days I’ve ever heard
And when she told me little girl the answer is love
So those are words that I keep with me
Though the seasons change so quickly
Keep them buried in my heart
And never fought

[Chorus]
So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said take my time and breathe
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

[Bridge]
I been goin on, I been growin up
I’m a know it all, I don’t know enough
See I was racing and waiting for the day that I would be old enough
Guess I’ll be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough

[Chorus]
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said "take your time to breathe"
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen



[Verse 1]
Run, run like the devil’s behind us
Run to where no one can find us
Be my accomplice to my crime
Oh baby
Run, run cause we’re guilty as sin
Run cause we know we won’t win
We know together we kill time

[Refrain]
You’ll never face a judge without me
You’ll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I’ll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time, with you…

[Chorus]
We’ll be Outlaws
We’ll take on the world
We’ll be Outlaws

[Verse 2]
Run, run like you never did
Cause they found the evidence
And they found your fingerprints
All on me and baby run
Run like your life depends on it
Let’s make forever in this moment
Tell me you love me again, Oh again
And I would waste away without you 
You’re the shinin' to my star
I’d be searching till I found you
Wherever you are… You are

[Chorus]
We’ll be Outlaws
Partners in crime
We’ll take on the world together
I’m Bonnie you can be Clyde
We’ll be Outlaws
You and me
They’ll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
O-O-O-Ohhhhhh-o-o-oh
O-O-O-Ohhhhhh-o-o-o-oh

[Refrain]
You’ll never face a judge without me
You’ll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I’ll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time
With you…
Oh with you
W-i-t-h you
With you Oh-o-o-o

[Chorus]
We’ll be Outlaws
Partners in crime
We’d take on the world together
I’m Bonnie you can be Clyde
We’ll be Outlaws
You and me
They’ll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
We’ll be Outlaws…



[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
We’re alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?

[Pre Chorus: Alessia Cara + Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

[Bridge: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

[Outro: Alessia Cara]
You're driving me wild, wild, wild



[Verse 1]
Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven

[Chorus]
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

[Verse 2]
I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had, I can't pretend
That I don't miss you every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise

[Chorus]
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fall
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

[Bridge]
Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more

[Chorus]
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fall
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears



[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can



[Verse 1:]
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Hook:]
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Verse 2:]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

[Hook:]
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Bridge:]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Hook:]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you



[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

[Bridge]
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holding me back



[Music Video]

[Verse 1]
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Verse 2]
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Bridge]
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Refrain]
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello]
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)

Coming home, coming home

When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more
I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello]
It's tearing me apart (It's tearing me apart)
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)

[Verse 1 ]
It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?

[Verse 2]
It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?



[Verse 1]
Oh there she goes again, every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing
You got me thinking me what we could because

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?

[Verse 2]
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinking we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?

In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?

Not tryna ruin your happiness at all



[Verse 1]
You've got my heart but I can't let you keep it, babe
Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time trying to pull me in
Cause I'm just a mess you don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now kiss me softly before I say

[Chorus]
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

[Verse 2]
And just know that I do, oh I really like you, babe

[Verse 1]
You know just what to say, things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more that I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday

[Chorus]
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

[Post-Chorus]
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

[Verse 2]
You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees
Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
So much younger yesterday

[Chorus]
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

[Breakdown]
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
You you, yeah till I tasted you
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I didn't know till I tasted you

Some girls, nothin' but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls, kiss new lips every single night
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebrating life

We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls, work hard, go far, we are unstoppable

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls, work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

[Post-Chorus]
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

[Bridge]
Most girls, (yeah)
Most girls, (wanna be, wanna be, wanna be)
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like...

[Outro]
Most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin'
I wanna be like
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebratin' life



[Verse 1]
Seems like everybody here
Is speaking different languages (ha ha ha)
With that green prescription fog
Blowing out their faces (ha ha ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
And they all look me up and down like I'm the fucking new kid
But I saw the sun rise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson (ha)
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (just for now)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Verse 2]
Twenty-seven blocks ago
I didn't even say goodbye (ha ha ha)
People blowin' up my phone
Askin' me if I'm alright (ha ha ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
And they're sending pictures, kissing on each other, like wasted
And on top on that, they're sending videos of them naked
But you know I don't judge what's on your tongue
Yeah, I know you're having fun (ha)
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now (just for now)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Bridge]
(Hell no's and headphones)

Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone (I just wanna be alone)
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home (home, home)
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones (ha ha)



[Verse 1]
What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns

[Verse 2]
Breathe deep, bottle it up
So deep until it's all we got
Don't speak, just use your touch
Don't speak before we say too much

[Pre-Chorus]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Verse 2]
You get under my skin
More than anyone's ever been
But when we lay in bed
You hold me harder 'til I forget

Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

You keep calling, you keep calling
Saying that you want it back
All my loving, all my loving
But you can't, you can't
You keep trying, you keep trying
With that sweet talk on your tongue
But I'm not buying, I'm not buying
I can't, I can't

[Pre-Chorus]
Can be mistaken
But you know we all make mistakes

[Chorus]
I'm just as fragile as you, oh, oh
I'm just as fragile as you, oh, oh



[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

[Chorus]
Come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak at my knees
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Yeah, yeah
I was so much younger yesterday

[Chorus 2]
Hey
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don’t need butterflies when you bring me the whole damn zoo

Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you

Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been
Can you wiggle wiggle for the D-O-double G again?

[Verse 1]
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
Cause I gotta leave
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high

[Chorus]
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

[Verse 2]
You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby I'm yours"
Ooh just the thought of you gets me so high
So high

[Chorus]
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)

[Verse 1]
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

[Pre-Hook]
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

[Hook]
I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

[Verse 2]
How many girls in the world could make me feel like this?
Baby I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

[Pre-Hook]
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

[Hook]
I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

[Bridge]
And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
Cause I have you, girl I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better
The day when

[Hook] + [Outro]
I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me (Yeah)
I'll say will you marry me (The day I get on my knees)
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me (what you do to me baby)
Got me singing (ooh)
Got me singing (ooh)
Would you marry me baby (ooh)
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
In the beginning, I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling, smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer, ‘till you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over, and we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Hook: Jason Derulo]
Tonight we’ll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
“We’re going all the way”

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the 4th of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we ain’t friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we’ll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it’s do or die
And take me to the other side

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
This could be perfect, but we won’t know unless we try
I know you’re nervous, so just sit back and let me drive

[Pre-Hook: Jason Derulo]
Tonight we’ll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
“We’re going all the way”

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the 4th of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes

So tonight, kiss me like it’s do or die
And take me to the other side

[Interlude: Jason Derulo]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Kiss me like it's do or die

So tonight, kiss me like it’s do or die

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Intro]
Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

[Verse 1]
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 2]
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm, there's only one way down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Bridge]
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Outro]
If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more



[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
Cause I guess I still care, do you still care?

[Breakdown]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young



[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?



[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge



[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

[Hook 1]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

[Hook 1]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

[Hook 2]
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
Cause I knew that there was the last time, the last time!

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Hook 1]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

[Hook 2]
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
Cause I knew that there was the last time, the last time!

[Outro]
Oh oh ohhhh
Let it burn
Oh oh ohhhh
Let it burn
Let it burn



[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship [shit] bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Interlude]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat



[Verse 1]
I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Verse 2]
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Bridge]
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Outro]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you



[Verse 1]
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

[Verse 2]
Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

[Bridge]
All you have to do is stay
So stay, yeah

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is stay

[Verse 1: Foxes]
High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus: Foxes]
Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Bridge: Foxes]
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Verse 2: Foxes]
Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

[Chorus: Foxes]
Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Interlude: Foxes]
Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?

[Bridge: Foxes]
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Verse 1]
I know that we are up-side-down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know
That we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You cue the lights, I'll drop the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

[Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why're you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

[Verse 2]
I am a fire, you’re gasoline
Come pour yourself all over me
We'll let this place go down in flames
Only one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
You cue the lights, I'll drop the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why're you gonna stay the night?

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Honey, it's rainin' tonight
But storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me your cover tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies...

I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours

I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Interlude: Selena Gomez]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm better under your reflection
But did you know, did you know, did you know, know
That's anybody else that's met ya
It's all the same, all the same, all the same glow

Honey, it's rainin' tonight

Tell me your cover tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies...

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I want you to know that it's our time

[Click here to read Zedd’s story about “Papercut”]

[Verse 1]
Now we're staring at the ceiling, you're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing, oh, oh
And we're stuck inside the silence, in a cold, cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Verse 2]
I find refuge in the distance, even when we're breaking down
Can we pause it just for one kiss? Oh, oh
Cause I never meant to hurt you, and I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut



[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
I was a boat drifting out into the sea
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope
That you would see me
I was a stone's throw away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles away
From reaching your hand

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
The waves they crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to step along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me
The waves they crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to step along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me

[Hook: Ryan Tedder]
Let's get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Yeah


[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
I was a boat drifting out into the sea
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope
That you would see me
I was a stone's throw away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles away
From reaching your hand

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
The waves they crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to step along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me
The waves they crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to step along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me

[Hook: Ryan Tedder]
Let's get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Yeah



[Verse 1: Kesha]
Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins, letting go again
I'm not afraid, I'm not

[Chorus: Tim James]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
No no no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors
It ain't no rainbow

[Verse 2: Tim James]
A promise with a lie is broken by design
What I thought I knew
Has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame
Right before it rains
I'm not afraid, I'm not

[Chorus: Tim James]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
No no no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow

[Bridge: Tim James]
Something tells me I know nothing at all
I've escaped my capture
And I have no master
And somehow it's like I've waited

[Chorus: Tim James]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no, and no I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my
My true colors, it ain't no rainbow
It ain't your rainbow
It ain't your rainbow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
It ain't your rainbow



[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

[Verse 2: Matthew Koma]
Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer

[Hook: Matthew Koma]
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

[Verse 2: Matthew Koma]
Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer

[Hook: Matthew Koma]
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama



[Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist



[Intro]
I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me
But let me stop you there, oh, before you speak

[Chorus]
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go

Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Verse 1]
First you gonna say you ain't runnin' game
Thinkin' I'm believing every word

Telling me I'm not like other girls
I was in my zone before you came along
Now I'm thinking maybe you should go
Blah, blah, blah
I be like nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
All my ladies, listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl all you gotta say is...

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Thank you in advance, I don't wanna dance (nope)
I don't need your hands all over me
If I want a man, then I'mma get a man
But it's never my priority
I was in my zone, before you came along
Don't want you to take this personal
Blah, blah, blah

All my ladies, listen up (All my ladies)

Lick your lips and swing your hips (Hey, hey, let’s go!)
Girl, all you gotta say is...

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go

[Chorus]
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no
My name is no, my sign is no, my number is no
You need to let it go, you need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Outro]
I'm feeling...
Untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling...
Untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling...
Untouchable, untouchable
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

[Hook: Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Verse 2: John Legend]
In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer baby, any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
So let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone
No, we're not promised tomorrow

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Bridge: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Outro: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you



[Verse 1]
Riding down, riding down
My hand on your seat
The whole way round
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touching the ground
Scared to take them off but they're so worn down
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first

[Chorus]
I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you

[Verse 2]
Letting go, letting go
Telling you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Asking you where you want us to go
You've been riding two wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm asking to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this coming off in a cheesy way?

[Chorus]
I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you

[Bridge]
(Everything you do)
(I wanna ride my bike with you)
(No training wheels left for you)

[Chorus]
I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you



[Howard Zinn]
Governments lie all the time. Well, not just the American government, it's just in the nature of governments. Well, they have to lie. And since they don't represent the people, and so since they act against the interest of the people, the only way they can hold power is if they lie to the people.

[Ophelia of the Spirits]
You don't know what I know
You can't see the spreading state of deception
I am cruel to myself
Things will never be the same

[Howard Zinn]
If they told people the truth, they wouldn't last very long.

[Ophelia of the Spirits]
I will hold my silence
Like a weapon in my hand
If I used it I would murder myself
You could never understand

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Columbus came ashore, greeted with nothin' but niceness
Sailin' west in attempt to find gold and spices
Dominated by the popes in frenzy for ices
The Catholic church expelled Jews and claimed it was righteous
The first man to see land would get a reward
And get a yearly pension for life, clearly from God
A young sailor saw land, said: "We isn't far."
Columbus lied, said he saw it the evening before
They touched ground, they were greeted by the Arawak
Columbus had them locked up as prisoners in an hour flat
He wanted to find their source of gold and that was that
And when they thought that wasn't fair then he stabbed their back
When there was no more gold, he took slaves instead
And left a quarter million Indians in Haiti dead
The men died in mines, the women died at work
The children died from lack of milk and they died in the dirt
They were just takin' advantage of a passive people
They were just bein' the savages of massive evil
That's the church work, that's the path of massive ego
That's the blood of Abraham bein' stabbed by the steeple

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
In 1619 they were patiently waitin'
For a ship that carried slaves that was changin' the nation
The white man was a cannibal, prayin' to Satan
Hatred, contempt – a pity of patronization
That's the corner stone everything racism based in
The African had a more advanced civilization
Black was slave, Master was white, rationalization
Fifty million dead, that's Western civilization
At first they appeared in the north
And they were helpless in the face of superior force
And all of them were chained together, they really was lost
Racism isn't natural, it's merely divorce
Before the slave trade, black was considered distasteful
By the Oxford dictionary, I find it disgraceful
It's not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful
It's the natural enemy of the critical staple
Slavery grew as the plantation system grew
The reason for that's kinda easily traceable
Society of helpless dependence was capable
Of saying, "Fuck a slave master! You're in slavery too!"

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Seven slaves were put to death for murderin' Master
Fear of slave revolt had them developin' faster
You a cataline killer, ineloquent bastard
I would burn the white man while smellin' the ashes
From time to time, white man was part of the resistance
White indentured servants wanted no part of the system
King Philip's War showed that if people would listen
Then they can maybe break the complex chain of oppression
Tyranny is tyranny, but that's a concession
But the women, they was treated like that of possessions
Black women had it worse 'cause they was abused
That's the white justification of Aryan blues
The next move was to dominate the Mexicans
James Polk dominated them like they was next of kin
He sent Colonel Cross to lie to them and let them in
Eleven days later his skull was crushed, so message sent
"We take nothing by conquest," that was the mantra
The military wasn't human, they was just monsters
Henry David Thoreau refused to pay his taxes
Denounced the Mexican War and got locked in shackles

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
The twentieth century opened, anger re-emerged
Reality of ordinary life was bein' heard
Anarchists and feminists came from factory work
Communism, socialism, seemed to be re-birthed
“War is the health of the state” is what Bourne said
And if you was born around that time, you was born dead
The Espionage Act had people confused
'Cause it was double talk, and they didn’t know how it’d be used
Supposedly it was an act against spyin'
Dubois knew that that was bullshit and they was lyin'
Charles Schenck was arrested in Philadelphia
For printin' and distributin' leaflets 'cause they was helpin' ya
He was indicted, tried and then found guilty
And spent six months in jail – don’t that sound silly?
Had his freedom taken away by his own nation
But there’s a lesson: do not submit to intimidation
The act still exists today and this shit is real
Supposedly, Kennedy tried to have that shit appealed
Eugene Debs did ten years for no purpose
He obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
The post office started takin' mail privileges
Of magazines who printed anti-war sentiments
A Socialist named Fairchild had it right
He said that: “They can shoot me, but they can’t make me fight."
They sentenced him to a year in jail and that was reckless
Sixty-five thousand men, conscientious objectors
They were sent to army bases to work there
They were treated sadistically and were hurt there
They were strangled with the hemp rope 'til they collapsed
And officers punched they stomach and they lower back
A garden hose was placed on they face with a nozzle
About six inches from them so they couldn’t swallow
The war ended in nineteen hundred and eighteen
The government was just tryin' to wipe the slate clean
Hemingway wrote "Farewell to Arms"
Dalton Trumbo wrote "Johnny Got His Gun"
The war was over, but they didn’t learn they lesson
Twin tactics of control, reform and repression
The patriotic fervor of war had been invoked
That’s why the country that you live in is a fuckin' joke!

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
You cannot be neutral on a moving train
This is a story about the lies that your teacher told you
This is real, actual, factual
No lies in the whole record
If you don’t believe me, look it up!
I’m tryin' to share the shit that I learned with y'all
Do the knowledge!
Your government does not care about you
The people in power do not care about you
Understand that! Power to the people!

[Howard Zinn]
War is like a fix. You know, you get high on war — “We won! We won!" — and then you look down on the ground again and you need another fix, you need another war. Why do you think we’ve had war after war after war after war? Every war, they say: “This is the end. This is the last war.” In World War I, they said: “This is the war to end all wars.” And then, not long after that, was World War II. And then soon the United States was waging war in Korea, and then Vietnam. If you study history, what you learn is that wars are always accompanied by lies. Wars are always accompanied by deception.



[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey

[Hook 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Hook 2]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Hook 3]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?

[Hook 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Outro]
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?



[Couplet 1 - Kool Shen]
A l'aube de l'an 2000
Pour les jeunes c'est plus le même deal
Pour celui qui traîne, comme pour celui qui file
Tout droit, de tout façon y a plus de boulot
La boucle est bouclée, le système a la tête sous l'eau
Et les jeunes sont saoulés, salis sous le silence
Seule issue la rue même quand elle est en sang
C'est pas un souci pour ceux qui s'y sont préparés, si ça se peut
Certains d'entre eux même s'en sortiront mieux
Mais pour les autres, c'est clair, ça sera pas facile
Faut pas se voiler la face, il suffit pas de vendre des "kil"
Faut tenir le terrain pour le lendemain
S'assurer que les siens aillent bien
Éviter les coups de surin
Afin de garder son bien intact
Son équipe compacte, soudée, écoute de scanner pour garder le contact
Ou décider de bouger, éviter les zones rouges, et
Surtout jamais prendre de congés
C'est ça que tu veux pour ton fils ?
C'est comme ça que tu veux qu'il grandisse ?
J'ai pas de conseil à donner, mais si tu veux pas qu'il glisse
Regarde-le, quand il parle, écoute-le !
Le laisse pas chercher ailleurs, l'amour qu'y devrait y avoir dans tes yeux

[Refrain - Kool Shen & Angie Cazaux-Berthias]
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse

[Couplet 2 - JoeyStarr]
Putain, c'est en me disant :"J'ai jamais demandé à t'avoir !"
C'est avec ces formules, trop saoulées, enfin faut croire
Que mon père a contribué à me lier avec la rue
J'ai eu l'illusion de trouver mieux, j'ai vu
Ce qu'un gamin de quatorze ans, avec le décalage de l'âge
Peut entrevoir, c'était comme un mirage
Plus d'interdit, juste avoir les dents assez longues
Pour croquer la vie, profiter de tout ce qui tombe
La rue a su me prendre car elle me faisait confiance
Chose qui avec mon père était comme de la nuisance
Aucun d'entre nous n'a voulu recoller les morceaux
Toute tentative nous montrait qu'on avait vraiment trop d'ego
Mon père n'était pas chanteur, il aimait les sales rengaines
Surtout celles qui vous tapent comme un grand coup de surin en pleine poitrine
Croyant la jouer fine. Il ne voulait pas, ne cherchait même pas
A ranger ce putain d'orgueil qui tranchait les liens familiaux
Chaque jour un peu plus
J'avais pas l'impression d'être plus coté qu'une caisse à l'argus
Donc j'ai dû renoncer, trouver mes propres complices
Mes partenaires de glisse
Désolé si je m'immisce

[Refrain]
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse

[Couplet 3 - Kool Shen]
Que voulais-tu que ton fils apprenne dans la rue ?
Quelles vertus croyais-tu qu'on y enseigne ?
T'as pas vu comment ça pue dehors
Mais comment ça sent la mort ?
Quand tu respires ça, mec, t'es comme mort-né
Tu finis borné
A force de tourner en rond
Ton cerveau te fait défaut, puis fait des bonds
Et c'est vraiment pas bon quand t'en perd le contrôle
Quand pour les yeux des autres, tu joues de mieux en mieux ton role
Ton role de "caille-ra", juste pour ne pas
Qu'on te dise : "Voilà tu fais plus partie de la mille-fa d'en bas"
C'est dingue mais c'est comme ça
Sache qu'ici-bas, plus qu'ailleurs, la survie est un combat
A base de coups bas, de coups de ton-bâ
D'esquives et de "Paw !" de putains de ston-ba
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Non laisse pas traîner ton fils

[Refrain - Kool Shen]
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse

I walk in like a dime piece

My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I thank God every day (uh huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (uh huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too

I'd wanna be me too

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Outro: Selena Gomez]
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I



[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on give me a taste
Of what it’s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

[Chorus]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Verse 2]
The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

[Chorus]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Bridge]
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

[Chorus]
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself

[Official Video Intro]
When I was on, when I was on stage and I was thinking of...
I felt like I know, I know him though
And I know that, and I know his heart
And I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
But I didn't realize that I-I-I feeling so confident
Feeling so great about myself
And then it just be completely shattered
By one thing, by something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy
You make me feel like it's my fault
I was in pain

[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Outro]
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Charli XCX]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Charli XCX]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Bridge]
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Charli XCX]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)



[Verse 1]
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

[Verse 2]
We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

[Bridge]
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
No war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

[Outro]
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now



[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Trying to distract myself
Then I see your face
Ooh, you got someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking all perfection out my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
All my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
Be the art, I'll be the brush

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking all perfection out my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
All my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Bridge]
And oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality
Oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
All my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar



[Intro]
I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

[Verse 1]
I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Verse 2]
I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival, revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Bridge]
This won't take too long, you'll see
I'm just tryna get to me, ooh
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Outro]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival



[Verse 1]
We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Verse 2]
Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Bridge]
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Outro]
You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober



[Verse 1]
Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

[Verse 2]
How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

[Bridge]
I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect



[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sitting right here real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waiting standby
Can't stop, because I love it
Hate the way I love you
All day, all night
Maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
I love you much too much to hide you
This love ain't finished yet
This love ain't finished yet
So baby, whenever you're ready

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that
(Let me get that, yeah)
And baby, once I get it, I'm yours, no take-backs
Gon' love you for life, I ain't leaving your side
Even if you knock it, ain't no way to stop it
Forever, you're mine
Baby, I'm addicted, no lie, no lie

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
So baby, whenever you're ready...

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it

When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Bridge]
This love will be the death of me
But I know I'll die happily
I'll know, I'll know, I'll know
Because you love me so
Yeah

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
(I'm gonna get it, yeah yeah)
When you're ready, when you're ready

(When you're ready, when you're ready
Come and get it, get it)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na



[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

[Drop: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

[Drop: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)



[Verse 1: Parson James]
Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now
We're watching, watching, as the credits all roll down
And crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house

[Pre-Chorus 1: Parson James]
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on

[Chorus: Parson James]
We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
At least we stole the show
At least we stole the show
At least we stole the show
At least we stole the show

[Drop: Parson James]
At least we stole the show

[Verse 2: Parson James]
Darling, darling, you know that we are sold out
And kisses fading, but the band plays on now
So we're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down

[Pre-Chorus 2: Parson James]
There's no heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Cause our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines we read so perfectly
But the show, it can't go on, no

[Chorus: Parson James]
We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
At least we stole the show

[Drop: Parson James]
At least we stole the show
We stole the show
We stole the show
We stole the show
At least we stole the show
Stole the show
We stole the show
Yeah at least we stole the show



[Verse 1: Conrad Sewell]
I'm a flame, you're a fire

Feel it changin' me tonight
Take me up, take me higher
There's a world not far from here
We can dance in desire

Our hearts are like firestones

Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones

And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came
I've seen in your eyes the dawn of a day
Where nothing will ever be the same

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
Feel my heart beating through my chest
I'll get used to just saying "yes"
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we began

[Chorus: John Legend]
Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Wrap you in love for the rest of my days
Pray you find joy through your pain
I can't protect you from every heartbreak
The world isn't easy that way

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
But I'll be there for you when you crawl
Dad will pick you up when you fall
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we began

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro: John Legend]
Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came



[Verse 1]
Thought I could leave you cause I felt my heart numbing
It hits so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running
I turned around and saw the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

[Verse 2]
But I don’t need you and you should know that, baby
It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
And I feel sorry for the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

[Chorus]
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

[Verse 3]
You wanna leave her, don’t wanna hurt nobody
I don’t believe a single word you say or that you’re sorry
Why can’t I say no to the look on your face?
I just stay, stay

[Chorus]
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

[Bridge]
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But will you, will you, will you?

[Chorus]
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

[Outro]
I stay, I stay
Oh way, do I stay?
So I stayed, stayed



[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Crazy to think that a man can't hurt
Love takes its toll every time it don't work, yeah
One door closes and another opens
But it's hard to let go when your heart's broken
I'll give you my trust, can you give me your word?

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
After he left you in ten times ten
Could I put you back together again? Yeah
One door closes and another opens
But I won't let go cause I'm not like him
Baby just say the words, let the love begin

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

[Refrain: Labrinth]
Oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love

[Bridge: Labrinth]
Yeah, you will take yours and mine
I got your heart of glass
You've got my love
I know we'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile

[Refrain: Labrinth]
Oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love

[Outro: Labrinth]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah



[Verse 1]
Tell me that you need me
To help you find a way
Through all of this madness
Can I be your light of day?
Please, won't you believe me?
Even if you don't agree
Know that I am trying
To help us all break free

[Chorus]
Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one
If you don't stop living your life
Turned to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one

[Verse 2]
I'm saying that I'm sorry
For things I've said and done
But I don't want to be here
If I'm, I'm looking down a gun

[Chorus]
Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one
If you don't stop living your life
Turned to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one
(left for no one)
(left for no one)
(left for no one)
Left for no one
Left for no one
(left for no one)
(left for no one)
(left for no one)
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one



[Intro]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love,I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

[Verse]
Not enough, I see you waiting
Your hands up, your body's shaking
That hard look, I know you're faking
I know you lie, I've seen you lying
With four months in front of me
And now we're same old enemies
It's cold blooded, come back to me
Come back to me

[Chorus]
I know you couldn't stand to be here on your own
You, you never last without someone to hold
Now you're crawling back, you forget what you are
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart
You say you're running back and caught in a lie
Say you'd rather die when there's no one to blame
Now there's nothing left, you forget what you claim
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart are nothing

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (If I could [?])
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)

[Verse]
It's not enough, I see you waiting
Your hands up, your body's shaking
That hard look, I know you're faking
I know you lie, I've seen you lying
With four months in front of me
And now we're same old enemies
It's cold blooded, come back to me
Come back to me

[Chorus]
I know you couldn't stand to be here on your own
You, you never last without someone to hold
Now you're crawling back, you forget what you are
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart
You say you're running back and caught in a lie
Say you'd rather die when there's no one to blame
Now there's nothing left, you forget what you claim
Now you and your heart are nothing, your heart are nothing

I'm in love, I'm in love...



[Verse 1]
Standing in the cold in the frozen wind
I'm leaving you behind but it's not the end
No, no, no
Walking on a plain as I hold my breath
It's gonna be weeks 'til I breathe again
No, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you hate it
And I hate it just as much as you
But if you can brave it, I can brave it
Brave it all for you

[Chorus 1]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our hearts keep trading places
We've got a wild love raging, raging

[Post-Chorus]
Raging, raging
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

[Verse 2]
Checking into hotel loneliness
It's not what I've been used to, I confess
To wake up three times a night
Talking to a stranger's nothing new
She knows how to smile, but not like you
So I wait for you all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you hate it
And I hate it just as much as you
But if you can brave it, I can brave it
Brave it all for you

[Chorus 1]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our hearts keep trading places
We've got a wild love raging, raging

[Post-Chorus]
Raging, raging

[Chorus 2]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Rolling on the wind with you forever
Holding onto us for worse or better
We've got a wild love raging, raging

[Post-Chorus]
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

[Outro]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Never feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging



[Verse 1]
We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We were high and we were sober
We were on, we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes (oh)
Ten dollars was a flat stack
I'd do it all again (oh)
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach (oh)
Re: Stacks on the playback
I'd do it all again (oh)

[Verse 2]
We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We were high and we were sober
We were on, we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes (oh)
Ten dollars was a flat stack
I'd do it all again (oh)
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach (oh)
Re: Stacks on the playback
I'd do it all again (oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Speed speed, speed speed oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Speed speed, speed speed oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Speed speed, speed speed oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack...

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment; let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright
When we cut the light

[Pre-Chorus 2: Britney Spears]
Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof

My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are; need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you’re a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (G-Eazy)]
And make me oooh (move), oooh, oooh (yeah), oooh

[Produced by The Invisible Men]

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
(It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
(The girls roll up) Windows roll down
(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
(The girls roll up) Windows roll down
(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!



[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Outro]
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now



[Verse 1]
I want your attention in this room
Your eyes on mine
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold
You make me come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low

[Verse 2]
We don't need crowds, we just need us
All my feelings are, about to erupt
All my tricks, they're spectacular
My encore is immaculate

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low

[Bridge]
Strut it out, strut it out, eyes on me (eyes on me)
Watch me strike a pose, feel my heat (feel my heat)
Spin it 'round, spin it 'round, three-sixty
Ain’t no boundaries here, no cameras, please
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, so entertaining
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low

[Outro]
Curtains are closing now
Guess that's the end
Can we go again?
Can we do it all again?
Nah, I'll take a bow
Up, down, run it ‘round
Tasting on my apple pie
Apple pie, satisfy



[Refrain]
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon l'amour
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-mois l'amour, mon l'amour
Comme une, coupure électrique
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon l'amour

[Verse]
Un moment avec toi, dans le noir
Un moment avec toi, dans le noir
Comme une coupure électrique
T'es la lumière, t'es la lumière

Fais-moi l'amour, mon l'amour



[Verse 1]
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Verse 2]
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume



[Intro]
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me
(And I) I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me
(And I) I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Interlude]
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

[Bridge]
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me
(And I) I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Bridge]
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time



[Verse 1]
Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

[Pre-Chorus]
Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

[Verse 2]
Last night I was in your arms so strong (it felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

[Bridge]
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (why is it so difficult?), so difficult
Chateau Marriott
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon



[Verse 1]
I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causing a commotion
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus]
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party

[Verse 2]
Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Loving me so hard it's causing trouble
If there's seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus]
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
(Crazy, go) Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
(I go fucking crazy)
Like a slumber party
A slumber party, yeah

[Refrain]
Like a slumber party
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight
Like a slumber party

[Chorus]
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos (our own videos)
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
(Go crazy, yeah) Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party (a slumber party)
Like a slumber party (I go crazy for you)
Like a slumber party

I'm like, "Hey, what's up? Hello"
I hit the strip with my trap queen, cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb'
I might just snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando, remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp, though, count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go? Fetty Wap, I'm livin' fifty thousand

[Verse 1]
I hold it down like a Snapchat
Go over your head like a snapback
Uploaded a pic, double tap that
And your flow's so old, granddad (bruh)
It's just banter
I'm way too much like a black cab (oi boss!)
Why you Snapchatting in the club for?
Just dance, man
Like yo famalam, yo fam, yo famalam
Ain't no gyal badder than
I'm on the roads, caravan
Let me do this fast, Ramadan
Cause it's going down, avalanche
I'mma keep it short, paragraph
Queen Lesh, I'mma reign, anorak
Take it off his rail, Nazareth
Oh Jesus, oh Lord, oh Jesus
A couple of snakey friends just Adam and Eve'd us
And there's no debate on who's better
I'll turn a man to a girl like Bruce Jenner
I shell down the dance like braaa
Mi bruck down di dance like braaa
Dudududu, dudududu
I be the one they love, I be the don
They know where I'm from
01 to the 21, yo bredrin
Where has your hairline gone?

[Bridge 1]
I can't believe it, I can't believe the cheek
Some girls wake up and don't even brush their teeth
That's a dead ting, that's a bad breath ting
How could you talk my name and you ain't even brushed your teeth?

[Hook]
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth

[Verse 2]
Bars cold like a tip top
You've got a pot belly like Rick Ross
Stiff gyal do the tick tock
Big mouth gyal, where's your lips gone?
I ain't got time to be ticked off
But I got a new wristwatch
Let's go toe to toe, flip flops
I'll make the crowd jump like Kris Kross
I've got a dark skin friend that looks like Rachel Dolezal
And I've got a light skin friend that looks like Rachel Dolezal
Which one's which? Not sure
Dem gyal are clapped, encore
Don't think you're buff cause you're wearing contour
Cause I'll wipe your brows off
I'll snatch your wig and your nails off (Bye Felicia!)
I go blind, hands out
Like I'm at the nail shop
Look, these girls are bluffin'
They really ain't on nuttin'
You can't do dirt on me
(Are you gonna go and get your cousin?) What?
Everyting ain't rosy, I beg you not
I'll Queen Latifah and set it off
Then I bounce like a belly flop
Got one eye on your man, Fetty Wap
Yeah baby, I'm getting gwop
Watch me like Netflix
You go to the club
But you ain't got dough for your gas and electric, dead ting

[Bridge 2]
I can't believe it, I can't believe the cheek
Some man wake up and don't even brush their teeth
How could you do that? How could you even speak?
How could you talk my name and you ain't even brushed your teeth?

[Hook]
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth
Brush your teeth, brush your teeth



[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go.) Will not let you go
(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Outro]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows



[Intro: Janelle Monae]
Girl, this is crazy... let me tell you

[Verse 1]
I can't believe all of the things they say about me
Walk in the room they throwing shade left to right
They be like, "Ooh, she serving face"
And I just tell 'em cut me up and get down
They call us dirty cause we break all your rules down
And we just came to act a fool, is that all right? (Girl, that's alright)
They be like, "Ooh, let them eat cake."
But we eat wings and throw them bones on the ground

[Hook: Janelle Monae]
Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm cutting up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be Queen

[Verse 2: Janelle Monae]
Is it peculiar that she twerk in the mirror?
And am I weird to dance alone late at night?
And is it true we're all insane?
And I just tell 'em, "No we ain't" and get down
I heard this life is just a play with no rehearsal
I wonder will this be my final act tonight
And tell me what's the price of fame?
Am I a sinner with my skirt on the ground?

[Hook]

[Janelle Monae]
Hey brother can you save my soul from the devil?
Say is it weird to like the way she wear her tights?
And is it rude to wear my shades?
Am I a freak because I love watching Mary? (Maybe)
Hey sister am I good enough for your heaven?
Say will your God accept me in my black and white?
Will he approve the way I'm made?
Or should I reprogram, deprogram and get down?

[Hook]

[Janelle Monae]
Even if it makes others uncomfortable
I will love who I am
Even if it makes others uncomfortable
I will love who I am

[Interlude: Erykah Badu]
Ohh, shake 'til the break of dawn
Don't mean to sing so tough, I can't take it no more
Baby, me and tuxedo groove
Pharaohs and E. Badu
Crazy in the black and white
We got the drums so tight
Baby, here comes your freedom song
Too strong, we moving on
Baby, this melody will show you another way
Been 'droids for far too long
Come home and sing your song
But you gotta testify, because the booty don't lie
No, no, the booty don't lie; oh no, the booty don't lie

[Janelle Monae]
Yeah.. yeah, let's flip it
I don't think they understand what I'm trying to say
Haha, yeah, uh, I asked a question like this:

"Are we a lost generation of our people?
Add us to equations but they'll never make us equal
She who writes the movie owns the script and the sequel
So why ain't the stealing of my rights made illegal?
They keep us underground working hard for the greedy
But when it's time pay they turn around and call us needy
My crown too heavy like the Queen Nefertiti
Gimme back my pyramid, I'm trying to free Kansas City
Mixing masterminds like your name Bernie Grundman
Well I'mma keep leading like a young Harriet Tubman
You can take my wings but I'm still gonna fly
And even when you edit me the booty don't lie
Yeah, I'ma keep sangin', I'mma keep writin' songs
I'm tired of Marvin asking me "What's Going On?"
March to the streets 'cuz I'm willing and I'm able
Categorize me, I defy every label
And while you're selling dope, we're gonna keep selling hope
We rising up now, you gotta deal you gotta cope
Will you be electric sheep? Electric ladies, will you sleep?
Or will you preach?"



[Verse 1]
My iPhone goes ping ping
Cause your mans on my line like ding ding
But it's not a ting ting
Cause he eats me up like din dins
Got money in the bank like ching ching
And I shine like bling bling
I will knock down any kingpin
So don't start me up like an engine
Skrrrr!
I'm a show off, nip slip
I go overboard, kick flip
I be in the cut, snip snip
Sitting back with my cup like sip sip
My bars bang, yours click click
I'm eating like I'm at a picnic
You got too much mouth, big lips
And I can't stand girls
Who take their heels off when they're in a rave
I'll step on your big toe
Just to remind you how to behave
Because you can't do them tings man
How do you think?
When the rave smells frowsy, cause your feet stink
Cheese Wotsits
Freeze, she's hostage
Flow's stone cold, Steve Austin
Long neck gyal, ostrich
So Fly that I'm chilling in the cockpit
Out all night, kinda like foxes
If push comes to shove like a mosh pit
You will get a dropkick to your drop lip

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Haters pree me everyday then act like they can't stand me
Bare girls change their friends everyday but forget to change their panties
Nasty gyal that

[Chorus]
That's a mad ting
Mad ting (it's a mad ting)
Mad ting (it's a mad ting)
Mad ting (it's a mad ting)
Mad ting (mad ting)

[Verse 2]
Punchlines like Sharkeisha
Deplete ya
Do not think that you're bad online
I'll backspace you and delete ya
I'm going in like change in the metre
You're a side salad, Caesar
Give you a box like I came with a pizza
So lighten up cause I'll bleach ya
And big up the gyal dem
Yeah big up the gyal dem
I'll be Beyoncé to these girls and I'll Michelle them
I don't know what else to tell them
Sounding like Alvin
I'll Kenan and Kel them
Shell dem, bell dem!
Just fall back, cause you ain't even all that
I missed a call from your man last night you know, but I never called back
Look don't be saying you're a good girl, when your breath smells like ballbags
Your man told me that you're mad, cause he drove home and made you walk back
Cause you're not that cute
And your hair's uneven, you look dusty
What's that on your lip looks crusty
Is that a cold sore? Must be
And yeah my bars are hench and they're muscly
It's about to get ugly
I'll upload a pic of your dog and sell it on Gumtree
Just for the bants, it's all for the bants
Just got back from Paris, just did a tour in France
Queen of the Scene EP real soon just watch when it lands
You'll have me as your ringtone, same ringtone as your dad's
It's mad

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Haters pree me everyday then act like they can't stand me
Bare girls change their friends everyday but forget to change their panties
That's nasty, change your panties
That's nasty, just change your panties

[Chorus]



Flow's tight like a corset
Your weave smells like cornbread, ugh
I'mma bring it to your doorstep
I'm about to be bigger than your forehead
Your head needs to get sorted
You will get licked down like a Cornette
I ball, swish, all net
So I don't know who you're eyeballing
Cause I ball, I ball like a bald head
I ball, Michael J-J-Jordan
You want beef? Safe, cool then
You got a team? K, call dem
And if you want more, I'mma give you more then
Your man goes down south like Morden
And he opens his mouth like he's yawning
Owwww, he's gorgeous
No lie
I'll be at your neck like a bow tie
I go ham, pork rind
I'm a put the watch to your face cause it's Show time
And I don't need any recognition, I don't need a cosign
Cause if these girls wanna team up then tag me in, clothesline
I make it ding ding ding like a phone line
I make it ring ring ring, that's my phone line
Wait
Hey booooo... if you don't mind!!
Babes are you alright?
Yeah, I'll be back before 9
There's Rosé in the fridge just pour mine
Cus I'm a give you that slow wine
Meanwhile
The Internet went mad for the freestyle
So now I'm getting bare calls, bare emails
And get your girlfriend boo boo cause she smells (ew)
These females Cha!
No malice
Known in London, known in Manny
Known in New York, known in Cali
Known in Texas and Cincinnati
I walk around, I roam Italy
I give them an eyeful, Paris
Get turned over, folded bally
Trust mi daddy
Back in the day I couldn't trust mi daddy
Jamaicans saying umhmm yeah she bad eee
Hot spice look pon di gyal eee
Your breath smells like batty
I'm gonna buss, won't need a cabby
Don't act like a likkle chicken from Kentucky
You're tryna win a high score on Flappy Bird
Meanwhile I'm trying to win a Grammy, truth
Break it down cause I'mma break the net
If I bust a rhyme it will break your neck
I'm a raise the bar then I'm a raise the bet
Don't chat to me just save your breath
Red dot, bow, Laser Quest
You're lost, you need an A-Z
And she really thinks that she'll pass me
But I ain't gonna let her, A-Z
A-Z



(Intro - Jalyn Sanders)

(Verse 1 - Montana of 300)
I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"
Mr 40 bang kicking niggas damn door
Up this bitch on everybody hit the damn floor
If you love your life you better let them bands go
I was out here tryna get it being broke I can't go
I ain't never lacking I stay with the damn pole
30 and this 40 I feel like I'm Rambo
They know I've got bodies they don't want no damn smoke
I used whip the Chevy sitting on them damn 4s
We strapped up in the club pistols on the dance floor
Now I'm 5k for a feature 10k for a damn show
Started from the bottom got it off the damn floor
Still gripping on my pistol I ain't never lettin' go
And I can ride with my baby
I'm just at the mall I'm getting fire with my baby yeah
And no bitch fine as my baby
Pussy soaking wet can't wait to slide in my baby yeah
Looked in the eyes of my baby
And told her that I love her I'd die for you baby yeah
Bonnie and Clyde with my baby (uh huh)
Shawty down to ride, committing crimes wit my baby (hey, whats up, hello)
I remember back in the day when I was bagging up country
I started trapping for money now I'm rapping for money
They say I snap and go dumby it's a wrap like a mummy
Ain't gotta mack to the honeys that comes naturally to me
And bitch I carry Glocks I done buried ops
So pussy come and get your cherry popped
Bet I wet a nigga like a fucking pool
When I catch a body like belly flop
I'm poled up with bronem
Count show money at the Marriott
Like fuck a deal I'm already hot
I ball out no Fetty Wap
Some might sit and wonder like "why he be on that savage shit"
But they don't know the half of it
Growing up not having shit
Momma off of crack and shit I'm at school being bad as shit
In front of the projects bumping backward flips on matresses
Grew older, weight on shoulders I start hustling and baggin' zips
Whole time I was trapping I was mastering this rapping shit
With hopes our sons would never have to hustle like their daddys did
That's why I'm so passionate
I used to imagine it
I'm so talented I got niggas who hate me blastin' it
Planet of the apes me and broskinem tote banana clips
My partners posing pictures with pistols call that a action flick
I told 'em fuck proving to them pussy niggas we packing shit
And taking pictures with theyself snitchin' bro that's that backwards shit
Start whackin' shit the rest'll start vanishing like a magic trick
Who better than me your hypothesis is inaccurate
So it don't really matter your favorite rapper's inadequate
Cause once I get to snappin' immaculate meets extravagant
I'm Maximus, Achilles and Spartacus mixed with Gannicus
Invested in myself just like vending machines with shades I'm stackin' chips
Go holla at KP 'fore I show ya broski my management
Big paper in pocket 'bout to fall out
So many fans can't even shop inside the mall now
Oh bitches see me on, oh they wanna call now
Shout out my haters who keep Tony dick in your mouth
You diss on me, me and my hitters up in your house
Caught a body, took the pistols to my dog house
Shawty riding for me I lay back she ride it for me
And understand that I'm the man and hella bitches tryna fuck me
Even though I am a killer she still love me bride of Chucky
And if she's poetic justice well I guess that I am lucky
She's my numero uno I don't know what you bitches think
She like me and just like me she don't smoke and she don't drink
She stay focused and her flow sound like a boat so we don't sink
Three hundred dollars worth of groceries got it all off of her link
Head fire, pussy good and you know that pussy pink
When I slide up in that pussy keep me warm just like a mink
Set that bitch up on the counter fucked her on the kitchen sink
And when I'm done she always bring me a wet towel and something to drink
And I'm like (ahh)
And she go hard for her nigga
See shawty held me down when times was hard for a nigga
Rent me cars, crack me cards bring it all to a nigga
If it's a foul yo she gon' take the charge for her nigga
And if I pass the pistol she gon' spark for her nigga
Up that iron and start sprayin' like stars for her nigga
Bring me back another broad then menage with her nigga
One sucking my dick one sucking the balls on a nigga
They eat me like a shark and turn to Jaws on a nigga
Let me cum all on their faces Santa Claus for a nigga
And when I'm on the road she help withdrawals for a nigga
Snapchat she make it clap I mean applause for a nigga yeah
Bitch I got bars like a prison
These other rappers weak you better toss 'em the spinach
And I promise they can't see me they Ray Charles to a nigga
And I'm all about my commas like a pause in a sentence
So make sure it's 'bout money when you calling a nigga
I'm a dog on a mission, flow's so raw and efficient
I go hard I'm consistent ain't no fraudulent business
Even haters talkin' shit was all a part of my vision
I told bro get on your shit so we can all make a killing
Risk it all 'fore I let my family starve in the trenches
No brakes I'm so driven I could cause a collision
If I kill you on sight, then I'm offing the witness
I'll be off in 60 seconds you get lost in a minute
So go ahead and dig a hole I'll put your coffin up in it
Niggas used to be my dogs now they all in they feelings
But it's FGE for life I'm taking off with the realest SQUAD!



[Verse 1: Gradur]
Sé-po dans mon bando
J'ai géré cette fe-meu, oui elle est trop nne-bo
Cambrée comme un Scirocco avec les quatre pots
Le genre de meuf qui boude quand tu l'invites au Mac Do'
Suffit pas d'un texto pour l'avoir au restau
Connait tous les footeux, Cristiano Ronaldo
Me dit que c'est pas une michto mais elle aime la nnaie-mo
J'ai sorti la Benzo pour la voir au tel-hô
Mais j'ai déjà ma go' et ça va m'faire des blèmes-pro

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh

[Verse 2: Gradur]
J'ai arrêté d'commettre des délits
Aujourd'hui j'suis dans la musique, sheguey ma vie s'embellit
J'rêve de quitter mon taudis, fuir la ce-Fran pour Miami
Plus voir mes parents souffrir
Mon dieu donne moi l'opportunité d'voir la Maman sourire
À la base c'était un délire
Aujourd'hui j'suis reconnu
On m'appelle même chez les cainris
Et le succès veut qu'on s'marie
Mais la route est périlleuse comme dans un rallye

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh

[Verse 2: Gradur]
Dans, dans, dans mon bando
J'ai géré cette fe-meu, oui elle est trop nne-bo
Cambrée comme un Scirocco avec les quatre pots
Le genre de meuf qui boude quand tu l'invites au Mac Do'
Suffit pas d'un texto
Dans, dans, dans mon bando
J'ai géré cette fe-meu, oui elle est trop nne-bo
Cambrée comme un Scirocco avec les quatre pots

I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh

[Outro: Gradur]
Dans, dans, dans mon bando
Trop nne-bo, texto
Au Mac Do', restau
Dans, dans, dans mon bando
J'ai géré cette fe-meu, oui elle est trop nne-bo
Cambrée comme un Sirocco avec les quatre pots
Le genre de meuf qui boude quand tu l'invite au Mac Do'



[Verse 1]
Please don't stop for a chinwag
You need a Tic Tac
You will get broke up like a Kit Kat
And then taken out like a bin bag
Becar it's going down, low blow
So don't make me snap like a photo (slow mo)
I'll come through hooded up like Trayvon
All blacked out like Akon
I'mma come to your door like Avon
And make you gimme them notes like Trey Songz
Mad ting, sad ting, like a Drake song
Everything's cool, payphone
I told you to change your panties
So why you still wearing the same ones?
Dutty Ay, no Sean Paul
I'm bad gyal, what you gon do?
Look, I've got supporters in Cornwall
And I know some ballers in Portmore
But wait, why do girls love to do that pose?
Are they your new trainers?
What are thoseeeee?
Eedyat gyal
Pick your nose and eat it gyal
I am the realest gyal
I-I-I am the realest gyal!
You ain't like Melesha
I'm a hurricane, yeah, I'm Katrina
English class didn't like the teacher
So I walked out like "Bye Felicia!"
Stay in school, kids

[Chorus]
They don't show no appreciation
Keep things short like abbreviation
All these girls are really hating
When their lips look like crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
Your lips look like crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
Their lips look like crispy bacon

[Verse 2]
I'm on the grind, skateboard
I'mma go nuts, acorn
They tried to take shots, paintball
But I'll cross when I want like a jaywalk
Pathetic, your weave's synthetic
If you think that you're gonna get past me
Then you can forget it!
Like, hello, do you hear me?
I've been dying to let you know that you're the biggest wasteman
Look, I'll take you for some garlic bread
I'll take him for a tuna salad
Just when they thought I was done
I gave them another one, DJ Khaled
So don't think you're bad
Cause your man prees my Instagram
So you got mad then hit the fan
I hit him up then I hit the dab like WOO!
That's it
Don't try talk with your black lips
I heat things up like June 1st
I took the crown, Miss Universe

[Chorus]
They don't show no appreciation
Keep things short like abbreviation
All these girls are really hating
When their lips look like crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
Your lips look like crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
CRISPY! Crispy bacon
Their lips look like crispy bacon

Queen Speech 5 you know
Sorry for the wait
I dropped my phone in the toilet
Bom bom bom bom
Bombom bombada bom
Bom bom bom bom
Bombom bomdaba bom
Woo!



[Verse 1]
Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
I’m machine, obsolete
The land of the free lobotomy
I wanna suck, I wanna lick
I wanna grind, I wanna spit
Tears of pleasure, tears of pain
They trickle down your face the same
It’s how you look, not how you feel
The city of glass with no heart

[Chorus]
If I had a tail, I’d own the night
If I had a tail, I’d swat the flies
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
Animals in the midnight zone
When you own the world, you’re always home
Get your hands dirty, roll up them sleeves
Brainwashed or true believers
Buy flash cars, diamond rings
Expensive holes to bury things
I’m machine, obsolete
In the land of the free immortality

[Chorus]
If I had a tail, I’d own the night
If I had a tail, I’d swat the flies
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh....

[Outro]
See me dancing on the scars?
See me dance?
If I have a tail, I will control the night
If I have a tail, I will control the night
(If I have a tail)
(I will control the night)
(When we have a tail)
(We will control...)



[Chorus - OneRepublic]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars

[Verse 1 - OneRepublic]
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I-I-I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[Chorus - OneRepublic]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Verse 2- OneRepublic]
I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

[Chorus - OneRepublic]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

[Chorus - OneRepublic]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Bridge - OneRepublic]
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned

[Interlude - OneRepublic]
Everything that kills me
Makes me feel alive

[Chorus - OneRepublic]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

[Chorus - OneRepublic]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Bridge - OneRepublic]
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned



[Verse 1]
Days when
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in
Yeah, perfect disasters
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
And on most of the days we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done
I remember, we were sleeping in cars
We were searching for OZ
We were burning cigars
With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun
And we said crazy things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we’ll never die

[Verse 2]
Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew 'til we had to go
And we were saying things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

[Bridge]
Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

[Chorus]
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we’ll never change

You and me were kids



[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 1]
Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

[Chorus 2]
I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 2]
Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

[Bridge]
Some people pray to their god for some magic
Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Outro]
You think it's a lie when I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Looking for you, looking for you, ah



[Verse 1]
I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
Until all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no, I've been on the brink, so

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm going to give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm going to give all my secrets away

[Verse 2]
My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like were chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
I don't really like my flow, no, so

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm going to give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm going to give all my secrets away

[Bridge]
Got no reason
Got no shame
Got no family
I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'm going to tell you everything

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm going to give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm going to give all my secrets away

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm going to give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm going to give all my secrets away

[Outro]
All my secrets away
All my secrets away



[Verse 1]
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black, that's making you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
Cuz we'll work it out, yeah we'll work it out
I'll be doing this, if you had a doubt
Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
Cuz I worked it out, yeah I worked it out

Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up, Man I can't let go

Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out

[Verse 3]
There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles
But mama raised me good, Mama raised me right
Mama said "do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them, cuz I'm so devout
Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out, yeah

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul
(Ooh) I'll be running
(Ooh) I'll be running
'Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out

[Bridge]
Ooh, we all want the same thing
Ooh, we all run for something
Run for God, for fate
For love, for hate
For gold, for rust
For diamonds, for dust
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's making you run

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul
(Ooh) I'll be running
(Ooh) I'll be running
'Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out

[Verse 1 - Outro Variation]
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black that's making you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
Cause we'll work it out, yes we'll work it out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Til the love runs out
'til the love runs out
Til the love runs out



[Verse 1: OneRepublic]
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
It woke me up right after two
I stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn’t lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But you’re like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Verse 2: OneRepublic]
Last night I think I drank too much
Yeah, call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I tried to say
Honey don’t you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Bridge: OneRepublic]
I know that we’re not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it to this time
This time now

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you



[Verse 1]
Hope when you take that jump
You don't feel the fall
Hope when the water rises
You built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out
It's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
It give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain...
Hope when the moment comes
You'll say

[Hook]
I...I did it all
I...I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

[Verse 2]
Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
Oh, oh
I wish that I could witness
All your joy and all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say

[Hook]
I...I did it all
I...I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

[Bridge]
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
With every broken bone
I swear I lived
With every broken bone
I swear I

[Hook]

I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

[Outro]
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh



[Verse]
I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I’ve loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre Chorus]
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight

[Chorus]
If I lose myself tonight
It’ll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
(oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose myself tonight
It’ll be you and I
Lose myself tonight...

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I’ve loved
I woke up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
(Lose myself)
If I lose myself tonight...



[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Verse 1]
Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told you
They'll be the King of Hearts, and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we got it good but they got it made
And their grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name
They've got

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 2]
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down

[Verse 2]
Do you think I'm special? Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear and the sounds you like
Are we just sinking the ocean of faces?
It can't be possible, that rain can fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday but it's far away
Over the world that's dead
They've got, they've got

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 2]
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down

[Bridge]
It don't matter what you see
I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say
I know I could never fake
Someone that could sound like you

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 2]
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down

[Outro]
Yeah, we're going down
Yeah, we're going down
All the right moves, hey
Yeah, we're going down
All the right moves, hey
Yeah, we're going down



[Verse 1]

When I was a kid I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly, and I would teach you for a fee
Broke every window in my hotel heart
When I was only five years old
The twelve years scared
But I'd hear the same voice echo in my mind
It'd say, "Son, you've got an angel."
That'd chase the devil out the mind

[Hook]

When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Yea he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those who learn to help themselves."
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

[Verse 2]

I took a little faith, and put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town full of "have" and "have nones"
And as I walked through that story-book life
I've been looking for an angel who'd chase the devil out the mind
Ohhhhh

[Hook]

Wave. Put your hands up and hands down

[Hook]



[Intro]
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
You
My darling, you

[Verse 1]
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So good-bye
Please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
You

[Verse 2]
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this I wish you love

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you

[Outro]
You
Darling, I love you
I'll always
I'll always love you



[Verse 1]
Share my life, take me for what I am
Because I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

[Bridge]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

[Bridge]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever

[Chorus]
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me
[Outro]
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you



[Verse 1]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Chorus]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

[Verse 2]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love



[Wyclef]
Yo Whitney and Wyclef
Turn this up you gonna feel it up
Yo if I became broke tomorrow
Would I still be your pharaoh?
Your ghetto Prince of Egypt
And if I got into a motorcycle accident and crashed
And became paraplegic
Yeah and if the feds rush the door
And find guns on the floor
And took us to federal court
Would you say they were yours?
If I had to do a bid
Would you take care of the kids?
And never let another nig in the crib
Keep the kitty licked, yeah

[Whitney](Kristina)
If tomorrow is judgment day (sing mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say, I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War Three
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay if you're coming with me

[Chorus x2: Whitney Houston]
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

[Whitney Houston]
If I lose my fame and fortune
(It really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the streets
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me (baby)
As the years, they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
(Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get, ooh
It's okay as long as I got you, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus x2: Whitney Houston]

[Whitney]
If I should die this very day
Don't cry cause on Earth
We wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
(It really won't matter)
I'll be waiting for you
After the judgment day

[Dyme]
Now I lay me down to rest
I pray that life don't get you stressed
If you should cry, if you should break
I pray these streets don't take your life
Means more to me than that Rolley with the plat
Heard that? Believe that, I ain't letting none of that
Go down, when the feds come tell 'em none, they my guns
And if they see me in the streets and wanna take my dough
Take my clothes, for that price you can have my life
Y'all shouting Dyme, that's my name
Chicks spit fire, I'm putting out the flame
For life, wifee, mommy to baby girl
I wouldn't give it up for all the money in the world
Oh my time is up, bricks to Mt. Vernon
Clef and All Star bring in Whitney Houston

[Chorus x2: Whitney Houston]

[Wyclef] (Kristina)
Collabo, All Star, East Side
Refugee Camp from the basement, West Side
(Clap your hands)
And it don't stop South Side
(Clap your hands)
And me, North Side
(I said the record is not over yet)
(Clap your hands)



[Verse]
A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you
You used to tell me, we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Going to get an old feeling, when you walk through that door
Cause tonight, is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other women is going to love you more
Cause tonight is the night
That I'm feeling all right
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm savin all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you, for you



[Verse 1]
Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out
But you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

[Chorus]
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

[Verse 2]
I'll pack your bags so you can leave town for a week
The phone rings and then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends down on 54th St
So why did 213 show up on your Caller I.D
I've been through all of this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around
And take some more
Things are gonna change
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more fears and tears left for you to see
Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out you were making a fool of me

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

[Chorus]
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

[Verse 2]
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love
Ooh tell me

[Chorus]
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

If he loves me, if he loves me not
If he loves me, if he loves me not
If he loves me, if he loves me not
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know

[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know



[Verse 1]
I want to dance
Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Verse 2]
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat
With somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Bridge]
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Outro]
Dance
C'mon baby
Dance
Dance
Get with this boy
Dance
Don't you want to dance
Dance
With me baby
Don't you want to dance
Dance
With me boy
Hey don't you want to dance
Dance
With me baby
With somebody who loves me
Don't you want to dance say you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Dance
Don't you want to dance say you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Dance
Don't you want to dance say you want to dance
Dance
With somebody who loves me
Dance
Dance
Hey baby
Dance



[Intro]
As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I’m lost without a cause
After giving it my all

[Verse 1]
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I’ve been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

[Chorus]
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone In you I hear a song
I look to you

[Bridge]
About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

[Verse 2]
And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm go'n make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

[Chorus]
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone In you I hear a song
I look to you

[Verse 3]
My levees are broken
My walls are coming down on me
My rain is falling
Defeat is calling
I need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me!

[Chorus]
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone In you I hear a song
I look to you



[Hook]
Young ass niggas mobbing screaming fuck the institution
Hella stupid, rob and shooting
If we meet it's execution
Flipping bitches like gymnastics, she going to let me chop and screw it
Got that work for distributions
Zannys, weed and Whitney Houston

[Verse 1]
We be iPhone 5's like Siri why you faggot niggas Boost-ing
And we pull out the Titanics and you faggot niggas cruising
And we say bye to Titanics hold 2 liter pour a Cruzer
We be catching every fade and shaving domes like Carloz Boozer
Y'all dudes get in flush like the girl's restroom
Can't pause my shine press start, resume
I smoke on dope get high like the moon
I get out dope we tab mushroom
Maxo so cool, Kream Gang them dudes
Respect my crew or end up on the news
We rob for shoot then beef with crews
The police don't know what to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fours tipping like a 40 year old virgin up in Onyx
Gripping grain and blowing chronic
Shooting rocket, astro comet
Catch me dead stocking, sole swapping
Nike Air polished
Leaning niggas like hypotenuse
Trigonometry, I solved it
Don't know how you can't get that shit
Two Glocks on my side with a thirty clip
With the hammer down I'm going to let it rip
Blue flag on the left cause niggas from the Crip
Like a Frito bag your mans get chip
Like a Frito Lay I ain't talking about your chip
Get off that dough nigga brick by brick
Stay strapped with a fanny pack on my hip
And we be under radar with surveillance
Start rapping I whipsering
Transparent, seeing through these sell-outs like a Christmas clearance



[Verse 1]
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet you life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas up, up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now isn't that loving you)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Isn't that loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you



[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I had a vision
And the vision was a tunnel with a door
Like a funnel for precision
Just a mission , no decision
Narrowing as it beckons me
More of a slide than a hallway
More of a hive than a hiding place
More of a hike than a walk or a stroll
It's a stride through a hole
In the wall in a crawl space
I be zen like a motherfucker
Zonin like a motherfucker
Bars like a motherfucker
Gone like a motherfucker
Smart like a nigga went to Jones like a motherfucker
Gettin' grown like a motherfucker
Push-ups getting strong like a motherfucker
I'm in my zone motherfucker
I'm be zonin motherfucker
I'm in the zonin...

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
You ain't been where I been (No, no, no)
You sure ain't seen what I seen (No he didn't, no he didn't)
Round these nigga, Round these nigga
Round these nigga, Round these niggas
I can't see a thing (In my zone)
I can't see a thing
You ain't been where I been
You ain't seen what I seen
When I'm around these niggas
I swear I can't see a thing (In my zone now)
I can't see a thing (In my zone)
I can't see a thing
In my zone, in my zone, in the zone, in the zone

[Verse 2: Lucki Eck$]
Shit, I got the world in my hand with some dice little nigga, I'm rolling
I got Google I don't need your advice old nigga, I'm zonin'
I'm Tom Brady '03, '07, little nigga, I'm golden
The bitch we ghost ridin' off of two little niggas she rollin
The fourth day in a row and I know it’s wrong been driving all in my pivot
Been passing smooth the whole drive
Just hope the Lord will come pick it
And them HBK's been kickin'
Been fucking around with these heartbreaks
I keep it moving, no slippin'
The banana peels falling your way its like

[Outro]
You feel it (I can't see a thing)
I know you feel it
I know you feel it (I can't see a thing, We zonin')
You feel it (We zonin')
I know you feel it (We zonin')
I know you feel it (We zonin')
We zonin'



[Verse 1]
Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 2]
Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 3]
Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
No, no, no



[Verse 1]
Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

[Verse 2]
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

[Verse 3]
Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love



[Verse 1]
Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With "Boy thought I told you not to go outside"
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from wooping your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall ("You nasty boy.")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

[Verse 2]
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

[Outro]
Can't you feel it all over
Come on let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people



[Verse 1]
A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 2]
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floor for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city, yeah

[Verse 3]
His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city, um hum

[Verse 4]
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Because where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city

Living just enough
For the city
Living for the city
Living just enough
Ain't nothing but a city
For the city
Living just enough
For the city
Living for the city
Living just enough
For the city
Ain't nothing but a city
Living just enough
For the city
Nothing but a city
The fortune kind of city
Living just enough
For the city
[?]
Living just enough
For the city
Ain't nothing but a city
Just enough
Everybody [?]
Living just enough
For the city
Living just enough
For the city
Living just enough
For the city
Living just enough
For the city

[Spoken]
Bus for New York City!
Hey bus driver, I'm getting on that horse
Thanks a lot
Wow, New York, just like I pictured it
Skyscrapers and everything

[Verse 5]
Hey hey brother, hey come here slick
Hey you look, you look hip man
Hey you wanna make yourself five bucks man
You look hip
Run this across the street for me right quick
Okay, run this across the street for me

[Verse 6]
What? Huh? I didn’t know!
Put your hands up you punk!
I’m just going across the street
Lay down, shut your mouth
Hell no, what did I do?
Okay, turn around, turn around, put your hands behind your back, let’s go, let’s go

A jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years
What?
Come on, come on, get in that cell nigga, god, lord

[Verse 7]
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 8]
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel no where could be much colder
If we don't change the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
Da Ba Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Ba Da Da Da Da Da Da Da



[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[Chorus] [x3]



[Intro]
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
WONDER WOMAN!
VERSUS!
STEVIE WONDER!
BEGIN!

[Wonder Woman]
Wonder Woman fly, I'm about to tell you why
Princess Diana, but this Lady don't die
My rhymes are signed, sealed, and delivered on time
You're a bald has-been, I'm in my Amazon Prime (Ha!)
I tell you what I say, you bit your style from Ray!
The grin and the shades and the king cobra head sway
Gods made me out of clay, then they broke the mold
I'm like Geena Davis, in a Justice League of my Own (Ow!)
I Just Called to Say that you need to ditch the hair beads
Lookin' like the Predator after some chemotherapy (Ha!)
But don't be scared, I let bats down easy
So you don't gotta worry 'bout a thing, little Stevie


[Stevie Wonder]
I feel like this is the beginning (Ohhh...)
But you have sucked for a few thousand years
I'm a man who comes from a higher ground (Whoo!)
And I'd say DC is a whole step down
I've been spitting out hits since both Fingertips
So use the tip of your fingers and read my lips
Now how you gonna talk about a bat being blind?
You need to echo-relocate to the 4th of July
Because you're Miss Independent, or at least you try
But your first story is you running off with a guy
Now let me tell the truth 'cause I know you got the lasso
You got that wack flow, Sufferin' Sappho!
I'm the ceremony master, blaster with the bars
And I got more Grammys than your panties got stars


[Wonder Woman]
Well, I'm a Woman who wonders what you're thinking
Some of your records make me wish you started drinking
Even if I stick to the best selections
Your YouTube videos raise some vision questions


[Stevie Wonder]
Your ignorant questions could never cause as much pain
As never knowing how stupid you look in your airplane
You're a misguided, C-minus-on-the-Bechdel-Test joke
And my worst song is better than your best TV show


[Wonder Woman]
Look, I don't wanna judge a Talking Book by its cover
But of the vegan buffet, you're a Full Time Lover
And a part-time father, from what I've discovered
Nine different kids with five different mothers


[Stevie Wonder]
You couldn't walk in my shoes, so stick to your reboots
With plots so thin even I could see through
It's not a superstition, I believe you got dissed
Not even your tiara's coming back from this! (Yeah!) Haha!

[Outro]
WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EPIC (harmonica sound) RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!

(Yeah...Yeah...)



[Verse 1]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on



[Intro]
Once upon a time
Not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck it's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says, "We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Ohh, we're half way there
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk
So tough, ooh it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers "Baby it's okay
Someday"

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Ohh, We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

Ooh we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear



[Verse 1]
It's all the same, only the names will change
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

[Hook]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think

[Hook]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted, wanted, dead or alive
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive

[Break]
Alive

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook - variation]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive

[Verse 3]
I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all!

[Outro]
`Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I ride (and I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (still drive), dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive



[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

[Verse 2]
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life


[Bridge]
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life



[Intro]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

[Verse 1]
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Whoa! You're a loaded gun
Yeah, whoa, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Yeah you give love a bad name

[Verse 2]
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Whoa! You're a loaded gun
Whoa! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Yeah you give love a bad name

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love



[Verse 1]
Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

[Verse 2]
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

[Verse 3]
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses



[Verse 1]
This romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always



[Verse 1]
These four walls have got a story to tell
Oh-oh, oh-oh
The door is off the hinges, there's no wishing them well
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Outside the sky is coal black, the streets are on fire
The picture windows cracked, and there's nowhere to run
I know, I know, this house is not for sale

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
When every memory is lived and my dreams all fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
Swirl my spike into the ground and I stake my claim
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I built these walls, it's in my veins
No time for lookin' back, the world is out the door
This heart, this soul, this house is not for sale

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
When every memory is lived and my dreams all fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Bridge]
This house was built on trust
That's what it is, it always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

[Chorus]
I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
When every memory is lived and my dreams all fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

[Outro]
Coming home, I'm coming home
(This house is not for sale)
Coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm) coming home, I'm coming home
(This house is not, is not for sale)



[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus 1]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus 2]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus 2]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun
Young gun



As I sit in this smokey room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend

Remember when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat baby

Remember how we used to talk
About busting out - we'd break their hearts
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go

Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Yeah yeah

[Intro]
Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is

[Verse 1]
Chill out, what you yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if, you could only let it be, you will see
I like, you the way you are
When we're, driving in your car
And you're, talking to me one on one but you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else, 'round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take, what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
You come, over unannounced
Dressed up, like you're something else
Where you aren't where it's at you see
You're making me
Laugh out, when you strike your pose
Take off, all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not fooling anyone
When you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else, 'round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take, what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Bridge]
Chill out, what you yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if, you could only let it be
You will see

You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you

And you take, what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it

Life's like this you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take, what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no



[Verse 1]
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
But secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus 1]
He was a skater boy, she said "see you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

[Verse 2]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Skater boy rocking up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

[Chorus 2]
He was a skater boy, she said "see you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

[Chorus 2]
He was a skater boy,she said "see you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

[Bridge]
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

[Verse 3]
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each others world?

[Chorus 3]
I'm with the skater boy, I said "see you later, boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio, singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know

[Chorus 3]
I'm with the skater boy, I said "see you later, boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio, singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know



[Intro]
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it’s getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up

[Verse 1]
Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say forever, stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young

[Chorus]
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it’s getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up
We'll be running down the street, yelling kiss my ass
I'm like yeah whatever,  we’re still living like that
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singing here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah, here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah, here's to never growing up

[Verse 2]
We live like rock stars
Dance in every bar
This is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change
They say just grow up
But they don't know us
We don't give a fuck
And we're never gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say forever, stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young

[Chorus]
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it’s getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up



[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne]
Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember, the pain of December

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & Chad Kroeger]
I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty, like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & Chad Kroeger]
I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

[Bridge: Avril Lavigne & (Chad Kroeger)]
I let it go (and now I know)
A brand new life (is down this road)
And when it's right (you always know)
So this time (I won't let go!)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Avril Lavigne]
There's only one thing left here to say;
Love's never too late!

[Chorus 2: Avril Lavigne]
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes
Led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Outro: Avril Lavigne]
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go (oh-oh)

[Interlude: Avril Lavigne]
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go



[Intro]
Let 'em know that we're still Rock n Roll

[Verse 1]
I don't care about my make-up
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say, "so what?"
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
I am the motherfucking princess
You still love me

[Verse 2]
Some-some how, It's a little different when
I'm with you, you know what I really am all about
You know how it really goes
Oh oh oh oh yeah
Some-some way, we'll be getting out of this
Time one day, you're the only one that I
Want with me, you know how the story goes
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock n roll

[Break]
Rock n roll, hey, hey, hey
Rock n roll, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Call it a bad attitude, dude
I ain't never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
You say, "me too", yeah

[Verse 4]
Don't care about reputation
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted
Some-some how, It's a little different, when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how the story goes

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock n roll

[Bridge]
Rock n roll, hey, hey, hey
Rock n roll, hey, hey, hey
Rock n roll

Yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock n roll
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock n roll

[Outro]
Rock n roll, hey, hey, hey
Rock n roll, hey, hey, hey



[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
You’re so fine, I want you mine, you’re so delicious
I think about you all the time, you’re so addictive
Don’t you know what I can do to make you feel alright?
Don’t pretend, I think you know I’m damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I’m right

[Pre-Chorus]
She’s like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
So come over here and tell me what I want to hear
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don’t want to hear you say her name ever again

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause she’s like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Bridge]
In a second you’ll be wrapped around my finger
Because I can, cause I can do it better
There’s no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She’s so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
In a second you’ll be wrapped around my finger
Because I can, causeI can do it better
There’s no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She’s so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend (no way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend (no way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend

No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend (no way, no way)



[Verse 1]
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away, I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do, reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you, I love the things that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you

[Bridge]
We were made for each other, out here forever
I know we were, yeah
All I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you



[Verse 1]
I can be tough
I can be strong
But with you
It's not like that at all
There's a girl
Who gives a shit
Behind this wall
You just walk through it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember all those crazy thing you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here
All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

[Chorus]
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I love
The way you are
It's who I am
Don't have to try hard
We always say
Say like it is
And the truth
Is that I really miss

[Pre-Chorus]
[And I remember all those crazy thing you said
You left them running through my head]
[You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here]
[All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it just went with it]
[You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here]

[Chorus]
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
I wish you were here

[Bridge]
No, I don't wanna let go
I just want to let you know
That I never want to let go
Let go, Oh, Oh
No, I don't wanna let go
I just want to let you know
That I never want to let go
Let go, Oh, Oh

[Chorus]
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
I wish you were here



[Verse 1]
I'm standing on a bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand? Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know
Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand? Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Bridge]
Oh why is everything so confusing
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-he-yaa, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah!

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand? Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Outro]
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you
I'm with you



[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Bridge]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

[Breakdown]
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Outro]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
So call me maybe



[Verse 1]
Be tormented by me, babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me, babe
Let it hit you cold and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me

[Pre-Chorus]
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

[Chorus]
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing I can't have
And nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can't forget me

[Pre-Chorus]
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

[Chorus]
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

[Bridge]
What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it

[Chorus]
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion



[Verse 1]
I really wanna stop, but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

[Verse 2]
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone
You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

[Bridge]
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I don’t know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I’m running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?



[Verse 1]
You're stuck in my head
Stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you

[Verse 2]
This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Verse 3]
Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep
We never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Bridge]
Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ooh
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold, ooh
Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ooh
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold

[Chorus]
My baby, take me to the feeling (take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (just run away)
Run away with me (with me)
(Oh, yeah yeah) baby
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Outro]
Run away with me, run away with me
Run away with me, run away with me



[Intro: Sia]
Listen, just leave or stay... but I'm done listening to it

[Verse 1]
"If you're gonna go then go"
She said to me on the phone
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
If you're gonna stay then stay
He's not gonna change anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that she's right and I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside
I know that she's right and I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside, from the outside

[Chorus]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend)
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend, yeah)

[Verse 2]
"Carly, you got to let it go!"
She said to me on the phone
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
It could be the perfect day
He'll just make it rain anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside
I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside
From the outside

[Chorus]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend)
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend, yeah)

[Bridge]
What's worse, losing a lover or losing your best friend?
Oh oh oh oh oh
What's worse is when you discover you're not good for each other
She's been giving, you've been taking, taking, taking

[Chorus]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend)
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend, yeah)

[Outro]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too



[Verse 1]
I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I’m just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still love you, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you
I didn’t mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can’t get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me when I’m not around you
I know that you’re in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

[Chorus]
I’m not the type of girl for you
And I’m not going to pretend
That I’m the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I’m not the type of girl you call more than a friend

[Verse 2]
I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I’m just a flicker in your head

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still love you, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you
I didn’t mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can’t get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me, when I’m not around you
I know that you’re in town
Oh won't you come around to the spot that we met

[Chorus]
I’m not the type of girl for you
And I’m not going to pretend
That I’m the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I’m not the type of girl you call more than a friend

[Bridge]
I’ll make time for you (time for you)
I’ll make time for you (time for you)

[Breakdown]
I love you, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you
I didn’t mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can’t get you out of my head

[Chorus]
I’m not the type of girl for you
And I’m not going to pretend
That I’m the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I’m not the type of girl you call more than a friend

[Outro]
I’ll make time for you (time for you)
I’ll make time for you (time for you)
I’ll make time for you (time for you)
I’ll make time for you (time for you)



[Verse 1]
You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry
Don't need a moon, I've got your spotlight

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say "I want you too"

[Chorus]
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

[Verse 2]
Wake up without you
Flood in my room, I see your headlights
And you got your reasons
You've got a way that makes it alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say "I want you too"

[Chorus]
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

[Bridge]
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y

[Breakdown]
You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry

[Chorus]
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Cry-y-y



[Verse 1]
Knock on the door
Leaving it open
It wasn't you
Why was I hoping?
Said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move
All that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

[Chorus]
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons, and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take you back

[Verse 2]
Cat got your tongue
It's been forever
Have you been good?
Have you been better?
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move
All that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

[Chorus]
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

[Bridge]
Drunk on cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
Dancing in the dark
Love made in the park
Big white blossom tree
Baby, cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go

[Chorus]
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

[Outro]
Drunk on cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
I won't take it back
Dancing in the dark
I won't take it back
Love made in the park
Big white blossom tree
I won't take it back
Baby, cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go



[Verse 1]
I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the room?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

[Chorus]
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

[Verse 2]
I saw myself tonight
Caught my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

[Chorus]
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

[Bridge]
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping

[Chorus]
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

[Bridge]
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping



[Verse 1]
I was lost
Alone, and searchin'
For someone who understands me for who I really am
Didn't know that I was hurtin'
'Til you lift me up inside, finally opened up my eyes, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

[Chorus]
You take me higher than the rest (hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher

[Verse 2]
Took some time
A few mistakes, but
You quite didn't show me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitating
But ever since you came around
I feel more than safe and sound, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

[Chorus]
You take me higher than the rest (hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah your love (hey) turns me on (hey)
Gets me higher (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, yeah your love (hey) takes me up (hey)
Gets me higher (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, yeah your love (hey) turns me on (hey)
Gets me higher (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, yeah your love (hey) takes me up (hey)
Gets me higher

[Chorus]
You take me higher than the rest (hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (oh-oh-oh-oh) (Second best, second best!)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me



{​Intro}​

In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
​
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
​
{​Bridge I}​

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

{​Bridge II}​

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I’m a blackstar, I’m a blackstar)
​
How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(I’m a blackstar, I’m a blackstar, I’m not a gangstar)
​
I can’t answer why (I’m a blackstar)
Just go with me (I’m not a filmstar)
I’m-a take you home (I’m a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I’m not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I’m a blackstar)
You’re a flash in the pan (I’m not a marvel star)
I’m the Great I Am (I’m a blackstar)
​
I’m a blackstar, way up, on money, I’ve got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(I’m a blackstar, I’m a blackstar)
​
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I’m a blackstar, I’m a star's star, I’m a blackstar)
​
I can’t answer why (I’m not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I’m not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (I’m a star's star)
Born the wrong way ‘round (I’m not a white star)
(I’m a blackstar, I’m not a gangstar
I’m a blackstar, I’m a blackstar
I’m not a pornstar, I’m not a wandering star
I’m a blackstar, I’m a blackstar)

{​Bridge III}​

In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and smile
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

{​Outro}​



[​​​Intro]

[Verse 1]
Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

[Verse 2]
Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

[Bridge]
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

[Verse 3]
This way or no way
You know I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now, ain't that just like me?

Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?

[Outro]

Real bad dizzy snatch making all the omies mad - Thursday
Popo blind to the polly in the hole by Friday

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes, we can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

[Verse 2]
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away



[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Because Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?



​[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war

[​Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse, with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Bridge 2]​​

[Verse 3]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my fate, I suppose
For, that was patrol
That was patrol
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Outro]
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
Woo!
Ahh! Woo!
Woo!



[Verse 1]
Cash girls suffer me, I’ve got no enemies
I’m walking down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 1]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those Oligarchs with foaming mouths phone
Now and then
Can’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Verse 2]
Dollar days, survival sex
Honour stretching tails to necks
I’m falling down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 2]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
It’s all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I’m falling down
Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Outro]
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to



[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(10) Ground Control (9) to Major Tom (8)
(7, 6) Commencing (5) countdown
Engines on (4, 3, 2)
Check ignition (1)
And may God's love (Liftoff) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro]



[Verse 1]
Sue
I got the job
We'll buy the house
You'll need to rest
But now we'll make it

[Verse 2]
Sue
The clinic called
The x-ray's fine
I brought you home
I just said home

[Verse 3]
Sue, you said you want it writ
Sue, the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words?
For, I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue

[Verse 4]
Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime none need tone
I kissed your face
Sue, I've pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face

[Bridge]
Sue, goodbye

[Outro]
Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown



[Verse 1]
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through
And I tread my troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black...

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

[Verse 2]
I loved you much;
It's not enough
You love blow
And I love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin'
Up the walls inside

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to

[Bridge]
Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to black



[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say "When we married" 'cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more,"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, You on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good



[Produced by Mark Ronson]

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

[Verse 2]
The man said "Why do you think you here?"
I said I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said "I just think you're depressed"
This me "Yeah, baby, and the rest"

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know..

[Verse 3]
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ohh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
It's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go



[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you
Is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand
Why do I stress the man
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could a never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I can not play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Bridge]
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
That only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own



[Chorus 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Verse]
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you
And are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Chorus 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie

[Outro]
Why don't you come over, Valerie?

Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

[Chorus]
What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig
(Oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did
(When I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that
(Out)

[Verse 1]
No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss
(All them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
(To yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself like this
(Out)

[Bridge]
Rulers one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

[Chorus]
What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
(Dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me
(Make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?

[Chorus]
What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew
(Best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through
(We were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do

[Outro]
Mr. Destiny 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)



[Verse]
For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing..



[Chorus]
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, ohh

[Verse 1: Nas]
It’s not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I’ll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take put in your face
Oh my mistake, you’re not a floozy
Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y’all know the story, y’all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady’s interest, I just met
The love scholar, she’s the teacher’s pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin’ for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can’t stand it
I’m a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? ‘Cause I’m deemed a heart breaker
Like smoke, girls linger ‘round a player

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, ohh

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, this recession is a test
It’s affecting my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I’m IEG
Those fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn’t protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you’re so deep
I said, no let’s go through it
Historically so ruthless as feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She’s thinkin’ that’s just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it’s a dragon, it’s a bastard you’re in tune with, just lust
I’m through with you after my crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, “Yeah”
You know how me and Amy are, straight players

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh



[Verse 1]
When you walk in the bar
And you’re dressed like a star
Rocking your F-Me-Pumps
And a man notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can’t tell who he’s looking to
Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that’s your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
Cause your dream in life
Is to be a foot-baller’s wife

[Chorus]
You don’t like play-ers
That’s what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire
You don’t like ball-ers
They don’t do nothing for ya
But you love a rich man six foot two or tall-er

[Verse 2]
You’re more than a fan
Looking for a man
But you end up with one night stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning you’re vexed
He’s on to the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don’t be too upset
If they call you a sket
Cause like the news every day you get pressed

[Chorus]
You don’t like play-ers
That’s what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire
All them big ball-ers
They don’t do nothing for ya
But you love a rich man six foot two or tall-er

[Verse 3]
You can’t sit down right
Because your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it’s ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Mi-am-i
Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met some-bod-y
And spent the night getting caned
Without girls like you there’d be no fun
We’d go the club and not see any-one
Without girls like you there’s no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don’t be mad at me
Cause your pushing 30
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps



[Verse 1]
It's okay in the day I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

[Chorus]
This face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

[Verse 2]
If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
This ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him
It's all I can do to assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

[Chorus]
His face in my dreams seizes my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in

[Outro]
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone



[Lil' Kim]

Creole Lady Marmalade Yes-ah



[Verse 1]
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

[Verse 2]
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself

[Bridge]
If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that
I've missed you since you've been away
Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you



[Intro]
Don't look at me

[Verse 1]
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

[Chorus 1]
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Verse 2]
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

[Chorus 2]
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Bridge]
No matter what we do (no matter what we do)
No matter what we say (no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
The sun will always, always shine (And tomorrow we might wake on the other side)

[Chorus 2]
Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes words won't bring us down
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh
Don't you bring me down ooh
Today



[Verse 1]
Sweet love, sweet love, trapped in your love
I've opened up unsure I can trust
My heart and I were buried in dust
Free me, free us
You're all I need when I'm holding you tight
If you walk away I will suffer tonight

[Chorus]
I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you, I am bound to you

[Verse 2]
So much, so young, I faced on my own
Walls I built up, became my own
I'm strong and I'm sure there is a fire in us
Sweet love, so pure
I catch my breath with just one beating heart
And I brace myself, please, don't tear this apart

[Chorus]
I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you, I am bound to you

[Bridge]
Suddenly the moments here
I embrace my fears
Knowing that I have been carrying it all these years
Do I risk it all?
Come this far just to fall fall

[Chorus]
I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
And finally found my way
I am bound to you I am
I am I'm bound to you



[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (my body is saying let's go)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (but my heart is saying no)

[Hook]
If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do

[Post-Hook]
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

[Verse 2]
The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (my body is saying let's go)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (but my heart is saying no)

[Hook]
If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby, then I'll be with you

[Bridge]
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
(If you wanna be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (my body is saying let's go)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (but my heart is saying no)

[Hook]
If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do
If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby, then I'll be with you

[Outro]
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out



[Intro: Redman]
UH, dirrty, filthy, nasty
Christina you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party
Whoo, ladies move, gentleman move
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire in the room
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Where my dawgs at?

[Verse 1: Christina]
(Uh, let me loose)
Oooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, coming through
Paid my dues, I'm in the mood
Me and my girls come to shake the room
DJ spinning, show your hands
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam
I need that, uh to get me off
Sweating 'til my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are thumping
Still jumping, 6 in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

[Hook: Christina]
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

[Verse 2: Christina]
Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back
Move your ass; I like that
Tight hip huggers (low for sure)
Shake a little something (on the floor)
I need that (uh) to get me off
Sweating 'til my clothes come off
Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still going, 8 in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hard rocking, everyone's talking
Give all you got (give it to me), just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

[Hook: Christina]
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

[Bridge: Christina]
Here it comes it's the one you been wait'n on
Get up get it rough, yup that's what's up
Giving just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (Here we go)

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, hot damn, Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina (what), better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (yeah)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm freaking

[Hook: Christina]
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

[Outro: Christina Aguilera]
Uh. What?

[Redman]
Another Rockwilder production
Aww... yeah



[Verse 1]
All the ways that you think you know me
All the limits that you figured out
Limits that you figured out
Had to learn to keep it all below me
Just to keep from being thrown around
Just to keep from being thrown around

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah...
Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face, hmm...
In a cold night, there will be no fair fights
There will be no good night, to turn and walk away

[Chorus]
So, burn me with fire, drown me with rain
I’m gonna wake up screaming your name
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

[Verse 2]
Now, we talk about our wasted future
But, we take a good look around
Yeah, we take a good look around
Yeah, we know it hasn't been for nothing
Cause we never let it slow us down
No, we never let it slow us down

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah...
Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face, hmm...
In a cold night, there will be no fair fights
[There will be no good night, to turn and walk away]

[Chorus]
So, burn me with fire, drown me with rain
I’m gonna wake up screaming your name
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

[Bridge]
Said, we remain
We remain

[Chorus]
So, burn me with fire, drown me with rain
I’m gonna wake up screaming your name
Yes, I'm a sinner, yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain



[Verse 1: Christina]
Hmmmmm
So, what am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch because I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy will do
Making up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

[Hook: Christina]
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down, nobody can hold us down
Nobody gonna hold us down, never can, never will

[Verse 2: Christina]
So, what am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

[Hook: Christina (Lil' Kim)]
This is for my girls all around the world (Yeah)
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls than he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same than she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera gotcha back

[Bridge: Christina]
You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls

[Hook: Christina]
This is for my girls all around the world
When you come across a man that don't respect your word
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So put your hands high and wave 'em 'round
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

This is for my girls all around the world
When you come across a man that don't respect your word
Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So put your hands high and wave 'em 'round
Take a deep breathe and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

[Breakdown: Christina (Lil' Kim)]
(Uh, ayo ayo, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Spread the word (Can't hold us down, c'mon, uh)
Yeah we here, we back again, yeah
Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera
Yeah (Can't hold us down, uh)



[Intro]
Tarzan and Jane were swinging' on a vine
(Candyman, Candyman)
Sipping' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)

[Verse 1]
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm

[Chorus]
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated Candyman
A sweet-talking', sugar coated Candyman

[Verse 2]
He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

[Chorus]
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talking, sugar coated Candyman
A sweet-talking', sugar coated Candyman
Oh, yeah, shoop do ba di ba shu ba da
Shoop do ba di ba shu ba da

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talking, sugar coated candy man oh
A sweet-talking, sugar coated Candyman

[Verse 3]
Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane
Good things come to boys who wait

[Interlude]
Tarzan and Jane were swinging' on a vine
(Candyman, Candyman)
Sipping' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)

[Bridge]
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my (uh) pop
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby, don't stop
(Sweet sugar)

[Chorus]
He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one stop shop with a real big (uh)
He's a sweet-talking, sugar coated Candyman (say what?)
Sweet-talking, sugar coated Candyman (say)
Sweet-talking, sugar coated Candyman
Sweet-talking, sugar coated Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman

[Outro]
Tarzan and Jane were swinging on a vine
(Tarzan and Jane were swinging on a vine)
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine)
Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
(Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell)
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
(Squared herself away as she let out a yell)



[Intro]
After all that you put me through
You think I'd despise you
But in the end I want to thank you
'Cause you've made me that much stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, I thought I knew you, thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
Because your greed sold me out in shame

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know
Just how capable I am to pull through
So I want to say thank you 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

[Verse 2]
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I'd realize your game
I heard you're going round playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the fights and the lies
'Cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore, no more, it's over
Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I want to say thank you 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

[Bridge]
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretend not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I am not going to stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back, I've had enough

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

[Interlude]
You thought I would forget but I, I remembered
'Cause I remembered, I remembered
You thought I would forget but I remembered
Cause I remembered, I remembered

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter



[Verse 1]
I was fine 'fore I met you
I was broken but fine
I was lost and uncertain
But my heart was still mine
I was free 'fore I met you
I was broken but free
All alone in the clear view
But now you are all I see

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're on me like jewelry
I really like you, but I'm so scared

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Cause now you got me missing you

[Verse 2]
Something I could get used to
I could get used to this
It's getting harder to leave it
Your lips on my lips
Woah, I can't believe it
How good it could be
Didn't wanna believe it
But now you are all I see

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're on me like jewelry
I really like you, but I'm so scared

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you

[Bridge]
Oh God, thank God that I found you
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God that I found you
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Thank God
Thank God that I found you, oh
Now you got me missing you
Now you got me missing you

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you

[Outro]
Oh God, thank God that I found you
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God that I found you
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you

[Verse 1]
Never thought this would happen
Gotta let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Verse 2]
You thought there were no boundaries
But you just pushed me too far
I guess nobody taught you
Nobody taught you how to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Bridge]
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Oh, now look at what you lost
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Now look at what you lost, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Outro]
I don't know why I cry
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I cry
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you
I don't, I don't, I don't

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape I would but, first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever)
We can make it better
Tell me boy, wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

[Refrain: Akon]
I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever)
We can make it better
Tell me boy, wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

[Bridge: Gwen]
Woohoo, Yeehoo
Woohoo, Yeehoo (If I could escape)
Woohoo, yeehoo (If I could escape)
Woohoo, Yeehoo

It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

You're like drugs, you're like drugs to me
I'm so into you totally

(Put me outta my misery) O-outta my misery



[Verse 1]
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things, get more comfortable
Everything is going right

[Chorus]
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

[Verse 2]
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

[Chorus]
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool

[Chorus]
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

[Outro]
Cool, yeah I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Cool, yeah I know we're cool

No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
Cause I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

[Refrain: Gwen Stefani]
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, don't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your loving is better than gold, and I know

All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, don't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything

Original track and ting, oh
You know you can't buy these things, no
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B
I rock the Fetish, people you know who I am!

Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't getting nothing but love

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]

C'est pas possible cette amour
C'est pas croyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait

[Hook]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Verse 1]
Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only want to fly first-class desires
You're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen

[Pre-Hook]
This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Hook]

I made my stacks now I finally get to lay back (to lay back)
I worked so hard now I finally get the payback (the payback)
And blaze sex, ridin' in back of da Maybach (chyea) (Maybach)
If it ain't dro', I say no, we don't play that (play that)
I'm in my house like a Boss reclined
Bumpin on da sticky green, sippin on me some wine (some wine)
I made it out the hood and I'm feelin real good about
Ridin' in the Benz tryna pull the wood up out (chyea)

We're hooked up with the love cause we grow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit

We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

I'm someone you love, making it clear, baby

Just scream out to Zoo, Zoovier is here

I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
Oh why, why would, why would you wanna be
Why would you wanna be with someone like me?
Oh why, why would, why would you wanna live
Why would you wanna live so recklessly?

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I don't know where I was, I was lost, I was nothing
The real version of me, I had never even seen
You givin' me truth and it's such an unfamiliar subject
So, could you answer me please?

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?
You're asking for it, you're asking for it

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I, I know, I know that it's a lot
I know that it's a lot to handle me
But it, it is, but it is what it is
It's all a part of my broken history

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I don't know where I was, I was lost, I was nothing
The real version of me, I had never even seen
You givin' me truth and it's such an unfamiliar subject
So, could you answer me please?

Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
I'm just icy, give you weapons and them bangers
Baby, I'm from the trap, I run the zoo, and I'm just askin'
Baby, I love your style, put you in Choos but not too flashy, ayy

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?

You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy

And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya



[Intro]
What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by?
Now it's only me

[Interlude 1]
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
(La la la la la la la...)

[Verse 1]
Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance cause you might grow
Oh, oh oh

[Chorus]
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?

[Interlude 2]
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Take a chance you stupid hoe

[Verse 2]
Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place?
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Your moment will run out
Cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (for sure)
Life is short, you're capable (uh huh)
Oh, oh oh

[Refrain]
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!

[Chorus]
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?

[Bridge]
I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style... go!

[Refrain]
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!

[Chorus]
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?

[Outro]
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you stupid hoe
Take a chance, you stupid hoe



[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Intro: Beyoncé]
And said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
That we shoot across the sky
Pour on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
And said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

[Verse 2: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I-Oh-I-Oh
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Outro: Beyoncé]
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...



[Verse 1]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus 1]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus 2]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world



[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Hook: Chris Martin]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Hook: Chris Martin]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Intro]
[Indecipherable]

[Verse 1]
Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told me

[Refrain]
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

[Chorus 1]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Verse 2]
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

[Chorus 2]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Refrain]
Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo, woo)

[Bridge]
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh then I
Want to share it with you
With you, with you
Yeah I do

[Outro]
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)



[Verse 1]
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

[Verse 2]
When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 3]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you



[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

[Hook]
Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know, you know I love you so?
You know I love you so

[Verse 2]
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

[Hook]
Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

[Verse 3]
It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

[Outro]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do



[Verse 1]
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

[Hook]
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Hook]
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Verse 2]
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious jewel

[Hook]
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Hook]
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Bridge]
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it magic

[Verse 3]
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Of course I do



[Verse 1]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up

[Chorus]
We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 2]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people
Break your heart? Break your heart?

Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

[Chorus]
We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go

[Bridge]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[Solo 1]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh whoa oh

[Chorus]
We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and float
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Solo 2]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh whoa oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh whoa oh

[Outro]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up

[Coda]
Believe in love



[Verse 1]
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path

[Hook]
I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

[Verse 2]
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms, oh
Cause you get lighter
The more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh

[Hook]
And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do, ooh
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

[Outro]
So sky
You're a sky full of stars
Such heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)



[Intro]
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
FRANK SINATRA!
VS!
FREDDIE MERCURY!
BEGIN!

[Frank Sinatra]
Ho! What's wrong with your face? Baby, yikes!
With those teeth when you're through there'll be no dust left to bite
Christ, newsflash, kid: this is show business
Show some class when you dress, shave that bush off your lips! Boom!
Your band's named Queen, huh? Ain't that sweet
You dance like you rode a bicycle race with no seat
That's what's wrong with you people, you'll do anything to get famous
You changed your name to Mercury, you should've been Freddie Uranus

[Freddie Mercury]
You think I haven't heard those things before?
You're just a bully who's too scared to go to war
You had a hit song called "My Way", but someone else wrote it
You're the least talented rat in your whole pack of rodents
You've got four notes in your whole range, you can't act and you can't dance
I'm more powerful than you when I'm wearing women's pants
Why do you stand there in a suit? it's like you're trying to bore me
When I rock the UK, South America gets horny
Because my songs have balls! They're the anthems of victory!
Your music is like the sound track to a vasectomy
You're in the pocket of the mafia, and everybody knows
Guinea Dago

[Frank Sinatra]
Guinea Dago?

[Freddie Mercury]
Guinea Dago, Figaro

[Verse 3 - Frank Sinatra]
Easy, Jaws of Life, I can't stand a racist
I love the coloreds and the queers, just ask Sammy Davis
Look, we all want to swing, baby, but you took it too far
You played butthole roulette and you lost the draw!

[Freddie Mercury]
I took one for both teams from a disease no one knew existed
I didn't leave a mark on history, I French kissed it!
I'm a champion of the world, extinguished in his prime!
So kiss my ass Frankie, but you'll have to wait in line

[Outro]
WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EEEEEEPIC (EEEEEEPIC)
EEEEEEPIC (EEEEEEPIC)
EEEEEEPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!



[Verse 1]
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

[Verse 2]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

[Verse 4]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

[Verse 5]
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way
Yes, it was my way



Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a, Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you



[Verse 1]
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues, are melting away

[Hook 1]
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

[Verse 2]
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one
These little town blues, are melting away

[Hook 2]
And I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York



I know I stand in line until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
Like "I love you"

I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
Like "I love you"

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
Like "I love you"

I love you
I love you
I love you



Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

[Instrumental-first three lines of Chorus]
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to end



[Verse 1]
Little boy says I’ll be in love with my fists
Little boy says I’ll be in love with my punches
Little boy says what should I do with my hands mom?
Little boy is told not to do anything wrong

[Chorus 1]
When I die I’ll be taken to the constellations
Have a drink, relax, there’ll be some introductions
This is Cassiopeia, this is Orion
This is Cindy, this is Nathan
That’s Chrissy and the other Nathan

[Chorus 2]
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father

[Verse 2]
I speak these words in utter isolation
I drive the car in a line from star to stardom
Little boy says I’ll touch the heart of the nation
Little boy says I’ll punch the heart of everyone

[Chorus 1]
When I die I’ll be taken to the constellations
Have a drink, relax, there’ll be some introductions
This is Cassiopeia, this is Orion
This is Cindy, this is Nathan
I just met him, no that’s the other Nathan!

[Chorus 2]
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother
I know that it’s a lot to remember says father
I know that it’s a lot to remember says mother

I know that it's a lot to remember says someone

[Bridge]
You won’t see who you want to see there
No one will want to be in your band
You’ll have to learn how to make it on your own
Spend a little time with your own hand

[Outro]
(we were heroes back home
We are heroes back home)

Little boy says I’ll be in love with my fists

And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
And we’re never gonna never gonna get a job
Fuck off teens!



Every night with my star friends
We eat caviar and drink champagne
Sniffing in the VIP area
We talk about Frank Sinatra
Do you know Frank Sinatra?
He's dead
*laughter*

To be famous is so nice
Suck my dick, kiss my ass
In limousines we have sex
Every night with my famous friends

Nice
Suck my dick, kiss my ass
So nice
VIP area
Frank, Frank, Frank Sinatra

Motherfuckers are so nice
Suck my dick, lick my ass
In the mix we have sex
Every night with my famous friends

Frank, Frank, Frank Sinatra

To be famous is so nice
Suck my dick, kiss my ass
In the mix we have sex
Every night with my famous friends
Every night with my star friends
Shake your body like the dance
Stupid smiles and autographs
This is a song for France
Shake your body like the dance
Stupid smiles and autographs
Every night with my star friends
In limousines we have sex

Motherfuckers are so nice
Suck my dick, lick my ass
In the mix we have sex
Every night with my famous friends

Suck my dick



[Verse 1]
That's life (that's life), that's what people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
Cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet
A pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 2]
That's life (that's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 3]
That's life, that's life
And I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come here this July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my



[Verse]
Those fingers in my hair
That sly come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do?

[Chorus] x2
Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
"Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
Cause there's no nicer witch than you



[Verse 1]
How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

[Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

[Verse 2]
Maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We’ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

[Verse 3]
How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, persists, and perseveres
And makes us whole

[Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on
That's how a moment lasts forever:
When our song lives on



[Verse 1]
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

[Chorus]
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

[Verse 2]
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go until we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on

[Chorus]
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
[And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

[Outro]
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on



[Verse 1]
I am recovering
The faith of a child
By a part of my heart
I was reckless and wild
I am recovering
The hope that I lost
The part of my soul
That paid the cost

[Chorus]
Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my peace of mind

[Verse 2]
I am recovering
Anxiety addict
A broken perfectionist
Somewhat erratic
I am recovering
A constant regretter
Hold it against her
At least till forever

[Chorus]
Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my peace of mind

[Bridge]
Hold me
As I fall apart, baby
Hold me
Here in the dark
Cause the old me
Run just as far as I could from my heart
Well, I'm going back to the start

[Chorus]
Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my peace of mind
Tell him I love him, yeah
Take back my peace of mind



[Verse 1: Céline Dion]
The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

[Chorus 1: Céline Dion]
Because I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

[Verse 2: Céline Dion]
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
Because I am always by your side

[Chorus 1: Céline Dion]
Because I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

[Chorus 2: Céline Dion]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

[Bridge: Céline Dion]
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

[Chorus 1: Céline Dion]
Because I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

[Chorus 2: Céline Dion]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Oh the power of love



[Verse 1]
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 2]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby

[Chorus]
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 4]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

[Chorus]
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now

[Outro]
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And if we



[Verse 1]
I can read your mind and I know your story
I see what you're going through
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't surrender because you can win
In this thing called love

[Chorus]
When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

[Verse 2]
When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see, if you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't surrender because you can win
In this thing called love

[Chorus]
When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

[Verse 3]
When life is empty with no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call
Baby, don't worry, forget your sorrow
Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all

[Chorus] [x2]
When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

[Outro]
That's the way it is
That's the way it is, babe
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is




[Verse 1]
J'ai compris tous les mots, j'ai bien compris, merci
Raisonnable et nouveau, c'est ainsi par ici
Que les choses ont change, que les fleurs ont fane
Que le temps d'avant, c'etait le temps d'avant
Que si tout zappe et lasse, les amours aussi passent

[Verse 1 English translation]
I understood all the words, I well understood, thanks
Reasonable and new, that's the way here
Things have changed, that flowers get fade
That the time before, was the time before
If all zap and tire, loves also go by

[Bridge]
Il faut que tu saches

[Bridge English translation]
You must know

[Chorus]
J'irai chercher ton coeur si tu l'emportes ailleurs
Meme si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton ame dans les froids dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore

[Chorus English translation]
I'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
Even if in your dances others dance your hours
I'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
I'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

[Verse 2]
Fallait pas commencer m'attirer me toucher
Fallait pas tant donner moi je sais pas jouer
On me dit qu'aujourd'hui, on me dit que les autres font ainsi
Je ne suis pas les autres
Avant que l'on s'attache, avant que l'on se gache

[Verse 2 English translation]
Shouldn't begin tease me touch me
Shouldn't give so much I don't know how to play
They say that today, they say others do so
I'm not the others
Before we attach to the other, before we spoil each other
Je veux que tu saches
I want you to know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3.1]
Je trouverai des langages pour chanter tes louanges
Je ferai nos bagages pour d'infinies vendanges
Les formules magiques des marabouts d'Afrique
J'les dirai sans remords pour que tu m'aimes encore

[Verse 3 English translation]
I'll find languages to sing your praises
I'll make my luggage’s for infinite vintages
Magic spells from African priests
I'll say them without remorse for you to still love me

[Verse 3.2]
Je m'inventerai reine pour que tu me retiennes
Je me ferai nouvelle pour que le feu reprenne
Je deviendrai ces autres qui te donnent du plaisir
Vos jeux seront les notres si tel est ton desir
Plus brillante plus belle pour une autre etincelle
Je me changerai en or pour que tu m'aimes encore

[Verse 3.2 English translation]
I'll name myself queen for you to hold me
I'll make myself new to let the fire restart
I'll become these others who give you pleasure
Your games will be ours if that's your wish
More brilliant more beautiful for another spark
I'll change myself into gold for you to still love me



[Verse 1]
Une photo, une date
C'est à n'y pas croire
C'était pourtant hier, mentirait ma mémoire
Et ces visages d'enfants, et le mien dans ce miroir

Oh, c'est pas pour me plaindre, ça vous n'avez rien à craindre
La vie m'a tellement gâtée, j'ai plutôt du mal à l'éteindre
Ô mon Dieu, j'ai eu ma part
Et bien plus à tant d'égards

[Pre-Chorus]
Mais quand on vit trop beau, trop fort, on en oublie le temps qui passe
Comme on perd un peu le nord au milieu de trop vastes espaces
À peine le temps de s'y faire, à peine on doit laisser la place
Ô si je pouvais

[Chorus]
Encore un soir, encore une heure
Encore une larme de bonheur
Une faveur comme une fleur
Un souffle, une erreur
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Pour tout se dire encore ou bien se taire
Un regard, juste un report
À peine encore, même s'il est tard

[Verse 2]
Si j'aimais rien demandé, ça c'est pas la mer à boire
Allez, face à l'éternité, ça va même pas se voir
Ça resteras entre nous, ô juste un lèger retard

[Pre-Chorus]
Y'en a tant qui tuent le temps
Tant et tant qu'ils le perdent ou le passent
Tant qui se mentent inventant les rêves
En des instants de grâce
Ô je donne ma place au paradis
Si l’on m’oublie sur Terre
Encore hier

[Chorus]
Encore un soir, encore une heure
Encore une larme de bonheur
Une faveur comme une fleur
Un souffle, une erreur
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Pour tout se dire encore ou bien se taire
Un regard, juste un report
À peine encore, je sais, il est tard

[Chorus]
C’est pas grand-chose, rien qu’une pause
Que le temps, les horloges se reposent
Et caresser juste un baiser, un baiser

[Outro]
Encore un soir, encore une heure
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Un soir
Encore un soir
Encore une heure
Un peu de nous
Un rien de tout
Un soir



[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning, learning, learning), I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah yeah

[Outro]
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
(On with the)
(On with the) show
The show must go on



[Verse 1]
I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go
And help us to be wise in times when we don't know
Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way
Lead us to the place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe
The light you have
I pray we'll find your light
Will be in the heart
And hold it in our hearts
To remember us that
When stars go out each night
You are eternal star
Nella mia preghiera
Let this be our prayer
When shadows fill our day
How much faith there's
Let this be our prayer
In my prayer
When shadows fill our day
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
We dream a world without violence
A world of justice and faith
Everyone gives the hand to his neighbours
Symbol of peace, of fraternity
La forza che ci da
We ask that life be kind
E il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro se
Another soul to love
The force his gives us
We ask that life be kind
Is wish that
And watch us from above
Everyone finds love
We hope each soul will find
Around and inside
Another soul to love
Let this be our prayer
Let this be our prayer, just like every child
Need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
Need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
It's the faith
You light in us
I feel it will save us



[Verse 1: Brian]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: Nick]
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 3: AJ]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Verse 4: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are

Don't wanna hear you (say)
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (don't want to hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (never wanna hear you say)
I want it that way
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Outro: AJ]
Cause I want it that way



[Verse 1: Nick (w/ Brian)]
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
(I can't get you out of my head)
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

[Chorus]
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

[Verse 2: Brian (w/ Kevin)]
Every little thing that you have said and done
(Feels like it's deep within me)
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

[Chorus]
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

[Bridge: Brian]
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
(When you look into my eyes)
What you did and where you're coming from
(I don't care)
As long as you love me, baby

[Chorus]
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

[Outro]
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me



[Chorus: Brian and all]
Everybody
Rock your body
Everybody, rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright

[Verse 1: AJ]
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Gotta question for you better answer now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick, Brian, and all]
Am I original? Yeah
Am I the only one? Yeah
Am I sexual? Yeah
Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now

[Chorus]
Everybody
Rock your body
Everybody, rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright

[Verse 2: AJ]
Now throw your hands up in the air
Wave them around like you just don't care
If you want to party let me hear you yell
Because we got it going on again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I original? Yeah
Am I the only one? Yeah
Am I sexual? Yeah
Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now

[Chorus]
Everybody
Rock your body
Everybody, rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright

[Outro]
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody
Rock your body right (rock your body right), Backstreet's back
Everybody (everybody), yeah (rock your body)
Rock your body (everybody), yeah (everybody rock your body)
Everybody (everybody, rock your body), rock your body right (everybody)
Backstreet's back, alright



[Intro]
Show me the meaning of being lonely

[Verse 1: Brian]
So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe

[Verse 2: AJ]
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 3: Kevin]
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me

[Verse 4: Nick]
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart

[Bridge: Howie and all]
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You are asking me
To feel the things you never show?

[Outro: Brian]
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why cannot I be there where you are?

[Chorus]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
There is something missing in my heart



[Verse 1]
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I’m going is anybody’s guess

[Chorus]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

[Verse 2]
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It’s written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

[Chorus]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

[Bridge]
I don’t mean to drag it on, but I can’t seem to let you go
I don’t want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go (alone)

[Chorus]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

[Outro]
Incomplete



[Intro: Pharrell]
Let's party

[Verse: Pusha T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room
Play time now holla
Pusha be one if you follow
Slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the gold Impala
Crushin, love my women in couples
One on each arm, keep double the trouble
So I gotta, shiffle my shuffle
Love how I cruised my hustle
Sex play, next day, call me

[AJ]
Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby, want to go?"
I should've said no, someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

[Hook: BSB]
Listen baby I'm sorry, just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby, gotta go

[Nick]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Hook: BSB]

[Pharrell]: Dance!
[BSB]: Hallo? Listen baby I'm sorry
(x3)

[Malice]
Don't stay up and wait
Cause I'mma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can relate
I take it aways, like two day stays
But look, still hit me on my two way page
See I'm heavy in the streets like a cream
Cold outside will take trips to Mary
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie
Accompanied by Clipse; Pusha T and Malice

[Nick]
Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing there in front of me
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby."

[AJ]
GOTTA GO

[Hook: BSB x2]

[BSB]
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go

[Neptunes]
Let's party
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
I gotta go girl



[Intro: AJ]
Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
I may run and hide when you're screaming my name, alright
But let me tell you now there are prices to fame, alright

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All of our time spent
In flashes of light

[Chorus]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

[Verse 2]
Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, come on
Wishing I could thank you in a different way, come on
Cause

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive

[Chorus]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive

[Chorus]
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

[Outro]
Yeah, every time we are down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, and that is what makes you larger than life



[AJ: Verse 1]
I've seen it all a thousand times
Falling down, I'm still alive
Am I?
Am I?
So hard to breathe when the water’s high
No need to swim, I'll learn to fly, so high, so high

[Pre-Chorus]
You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

[Chorus]
When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of

[Kevin: Verse 2]
Gloves are off, Ready to fight
Like a lion, I will survive
Will I? Will I?
You gotta stand for something
Even if you stand alone, don’t be afraid
It’s gonna be alright

[Nick: Pre-Chorus]
You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky (Woo, woo, woo)
Living proof I see myself in you (Oh)

[Chorus]
When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of

[Bridge]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Just show ‘em what you’re made of)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You find the truth in a child’s eyes
When the only limit is the sky
Living proof I see myself in you

[Chorus]
When walls starts to close in
Your heart is frozen over
Just show ‘em what you’re made of
(You can show 'em what you're made of)
When sunlight is fading
The world will be waiting for you
Just show ‘em what you’re made of

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Madeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes?
What happened when you shut down
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

[Chorus]
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine



[Verse 1: Brian]
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Verse 2: A.J.]
Sadness is beautiful; loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

[Chorus]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Bridge: Nick]
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Outro: A.J.]
Show you the shape of my heart



[Intro: Janet Jackson]
Plush...
Come on

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

[Interlude: Janet Jackson (J. Cole)]
Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 3: J. Cole (Janet Jackson)]
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this seems
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (J. Cole) Simultaneous]
Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

I wish me being happy didn't make you so sad

Ever so slowly
You're making me quiver
Baby would you mind undressing me
Making me feel sexy
While in the moment

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm gonna
Bathe you, play with you, rub you, caress you
Tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna
Touch you, tease you, lick you, please you
Love you, hold you, make love to you
And I'm gonna
Kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you
Feel you deep inside me ohh
I'm gonna
Kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you
Feel you, make you come too

Baby would you mind kissing me
All over my body
You missed a spot - there
Baby would you mind tasting me
It's making me all juicy
Feeling your lips on mine

[Chorus]

Baby would you mind coming inside of me
Letting your juices free
Deep in my passion

Now you realizing when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I'm gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh

Now why you wanna go and do that

That you don't know what you've got til it's

Moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips

[Chorus]
I don't wanna stop just because
People walking by are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now

You feel so good inside of my love

My mind is starting to burn
With forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could
Well... you know

People walking by are watching us

Did I ever go without your love
You made me feel wanted
I wanna tell you how important
You are to me, love

Truth is, truth is that I wouldn’t be here
Without the love I stand on
Anytime I get lost in the world
You’ll always be there
To care and share
In the joy and the pain, oh
Our love won’t change

And what I share with you
Ever sacred, everlasting
The greatest love for me

My heart will never be hurt
Family that walks through fire for me
So I don’t get burnt
Fans and friends chime in
To a love that’s true blue

Ever sacred, everlasting
The greatest love for me

That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
(That's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes (that's the way)
That's the way love goes

[Verse 2]
Don't mind if I light candles
I like to watch us play and
Baby, I've got on what you like
Come closer, baby, closer
Reach out and feel my body
I'm gonna give you all my love
Ooh, sugar don't you hurry
You've got me here all night
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
(That's the way, that's the way)
Ooh, baby, don't stop, don't stop
Go deeper, baby, deeper
You feel so good I'm gonna cry
Ooh, I'm gonna take your there

[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
Don't you know it goes? That's the way

[Interlude]
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?

[Bridge]
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (that's the way, that's the way)
That's the way love goes, it goes, it goes
(That's the way, that's the way)
That's the way love goes

[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (that's the way love goes)
That's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love That's the way love, that's the way love, that's the way love
That's the way love goes



Gimme a beat!

Sittin' in the movie show
Thinkin' nasty thoughts
Better be a gentleman
Or you'll turn me off
That's right, lemme tell it

[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty girl
I don't like nasty food
The only nasty thing I like
Is a nasty groove
Will this one do?

Uh huh, I know... say...

[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty, nasty boys, gimme a nasty groove
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, lemme see your nasty body move
Oh you nasty boys
I could learn to like this, listen up...

I'm not a prude, I just want some respect
So close the door if you want me to respond
Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is control
No, my first name ain't baby
It's Janet... Ms. Jackson if you're nasty

[Chorus]
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me
Nasty... don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys

(I like this part)

Hey! Who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts? Nasty boys!
Who's that in that nasty car? Nasty boys!
Who's that eatin' that nasty fruit? Nasty boys!
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove? Nasty boys!
Ladies? Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys

[Bridge 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you’re all out loving that JLove true

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Hold up, I can get you fun up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
I'mma tie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'mma need about 4-5 beds
Cause I love my papi

[Bridge 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi

[Bridge 1: Jennifer Lopez]

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopes]
All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain’t trying to count mileage
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
Cause I love my papi

[Bridge 2] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami
Shorty got me catching feelings
And that rave drop reaching for the ceiling
Southside Bronx, Teterboro just overseas
Take the pins out her hair, drop to her knees
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma
Rock-rock Gators like my detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us
From the bottom it been real
From the bottom shorty been trill
And even though we made it to the top
Still J.Lo from the-the the block
Ey, I love you, mami, I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
I think I love just who you are
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin all the way to the end
And we started as friends, boy I do love

[Hook]



[Intro]
[J-Lo & LL Cool J]
Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love...

Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...
(Baby, don't go)
(Baby, don't go) Yeah
(Baby, don't go, uh)
(Baby, don't go) Yeah
(Baby, don't go)
(Baby, don't go) Yeah, yeah
(Why you act like that?)

[Verse 1][J-Lo]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me

[LL Cool J]
Uh, uh, uh
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[J-Lo]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son
I got to leave you alone

[J-Lo]
Because I'm good holding my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

[Chorus] [J-Lo] [LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)
You'll be needing me, but too bad
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)
You had to your choice to run alone
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)

[J-Lo]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

[LL Cool J]
Uh, uh, uh
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creeping all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here

[J-Lo]
Stop playing you, gaming
I got to leave you alone

[J-Lo] [LL Cool J]
Because I'm good holding my spot (Stop acting like that)
And I'm good repping the girls on the block (Now you know you need to stop)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right (Here we go)

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homey
Instead of beef you come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here

[J-Lo]
There is nothing you can say to me that can change my mind
I got to let you go now
And nothing will ever be the same, so just be on your way
Go ahead and do your thing now
And there's no more to explain to me, you no
I know your game and I'm feeling what you do

[J-Lo]
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son
I got to leave you alone, yeah, yeah

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
I promise you
You know what I'm saying

If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away

And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away

[Bridge: Pibull]
That badonkadonk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven-trey donkey donk
All I need is some vodka and some coke
And watch, she gonna get donkey konged
Baby if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, dale
Don't believe me, just bet me
My name ain't Keith, but I see why you sweat me
L.A., Miami, New York
Say no more, get on the floor

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
La, la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La, la la la la, la la la la la la la la la

Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hi, I’m Tune,  the man on the moon

And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Young Money!

You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spell
Let me no other choice but to get down

It’s too late, it’s too late
It’s too late, it’s too late
You got it, you got it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover

I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah

Listen, now I’m strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharp shooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I’m not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez + Lil Wayne]
It’s too late, it’s too late
It’s too late, it’s too late
You got it, you got it

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I’m into you, like you never knew
I’m falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You’re way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, you can overwhelm me
It’s too late, it’s too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah

Did you expect me to reason with thunder
I still remember when time was frozen
What seemed forever was just a moment
Hurry up, hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving

[Chorus]
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back

Here we go
Here we go
It's better now

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

[Hook: Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Verse 2: John Legend]
In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer baby, any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
So let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone
No, we're not promised tomorrow

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Bridge: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Outro: Meghan Trainor and John Legend]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

They can't do it like I do

If your lips are movin, I said you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby

[Verse 1]
Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you’re not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'mma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

[Pre-Chorus]
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

[Chorus]
I know you're lyin'
Cause your lips are movin'
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are movin
Baby don't you know I'm done?

[Break]
If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby

You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
Finally blew up in my face
Crash and burned to pieces
You got what you want from me
I gave you what you needed

[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I was warned, but fooled by charm
And you deserve to be alone

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
And I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, better than you, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
I used to cry to all my friends
But they would say, "I told ya"
Finally, I can breathe again
The weight is off my shoulders

[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I was warned, but fooled by charm
And you, you deserve to be alone

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
And I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, better than you, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about the word "deserve"
Or talk 'bout the world deserves: a queen (You queen)
Let's talk about that four letter word (Love)
I think you deserve a king
I think you deserve the world and everything in it
And I try to go get it to show you I meant it when I
Tell you I'm sorry, tomorrow I promise that I
Try to be better, I'll do whatever for mine
And I ain't tryna be your friend's friends
Or your quote-unquote "fake friends", that's why I hate friends
I'd rather see you laugh than see you cry
I'd rather see you leave than tell a lie
And you ain't gotta say it, you deserve better

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, better than you, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
The dumb drummer, sicker than the swine flu
Don't really need medication, he got a tissue
And when he bang bangs, don't need to boogie
But he might be sweeter than my, my favorite cookie
When he plays, uh, he got a hold on me
In a race, yeah, he got the winning streak
And ain't nobody got a drummer like mine
He can bang dem sticks, he can throw dem high, ha!

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
Triplet, triplet, all that shit

He can do the paradiddle with a little bit of samba
And all the girls scream, "I want your drummer's number"
But wait a minute, what trick is going on?
You here to see M. Train because you love my songs
But there he go again with the double stroke
And I ain't talking dirty, I ain't making no jokes, nuh uh, nuh uh
And he can play all night
Whatever get you hype girls, whatever gets you high
Cause ain't nobody got a drummer like mine

[Outro: Meghan Trainor]
Hey, hey

So baby, show off all dem tricks and bang dem sticks

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh
Eh

[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus 1]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus 2]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind

[Bridge]
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it

[Chorus 3]
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

[Verse 2]
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

[Chorus]
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah

[Bridge]
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?



[Verse 1]
Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Chorus]
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

[Verse 2]
Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Chorus]
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel

No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

[Bridge]
Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for ...

[Chorus]
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I’m in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
I’m still falling ...
And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I’m still falling for you



[Verse 1]
We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

[Chorus]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire fire fire
And we gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn

[Verse 2]
We don't wanna leave, no, we just gonna be right now, right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy getting low go 'till the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we start the fire, and we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no secret now, no secret, no secret now

[Chorus]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire fire fire
And we gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn

[Bridge 1]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn burn burn

[Bridge 2]
We can light it up up up
So they can't put it out out out

Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire fire fire
And we're gonna let it burn



[Chorus]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes since we found out
Since we found out

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Verse 1]
After the war we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color

But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

[Chorus]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Outro]
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be

But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you



[Produced by Max Martin]

[Verse 1]
I know that I've been messed up
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
But yeah, you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

[Verse 2]
16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

[Verse 3]
Dark times, you can always find the bright side
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
And yeah it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

[Refrain]
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
(I'll be yours)
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army

[Bridge]
Yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either

[Outro]
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
Standing with an army



[Verse 1]
It's the strangest feeling
Feeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I’m never healing
It’s heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
I don’t know what it is you do
Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here, yours again

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Something in the way you move
There's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
There's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight, (night)
There's something in the way you do
There's something in the way you
Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing  left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Something in the way you move
There's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

[Instrumental Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Something in the way you move
There's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh



[Verse 1]
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone



[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and...
I just don't know what is wrong

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, give me that respect, forgive me and forget
You've got to get a grip, living on the edge
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
And if there is too much on my plate then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
You gave me what I needed and I gave her everything she wanted
There's something 'bout your cleavage, now I can't put my fingers on it
Been taking me the deepest, I thought that she was gonna vomit
If all women are from Venus then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
With you and me
With you and



[Verse 1]
Eyes make their peace in difficulties
With wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally, we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time
Before daylight

[Verse 2]
And the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you, like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

[Bridge]
I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

[Outro]
Wanna hear your beating heart, tonight



[Intro: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
How you doing, young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

[Nelly Furtado]
You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light

[Timbaland]
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

[Nelly Furtado]
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it

[Timbaland]
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

[Nelly Furtado]
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it
Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Verse 2:]
[Nelly Furtado]
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute

[Timbaland]
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

[Timbaland]
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health

[Timbaland]
I want you on my team
[Nelly Furtado]
So does everybody else

[Timbaland]
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
[Nelly Furtado]
What kind of girl do you take me for?

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Timbaland [while doing that "chicka" noise]
Don't be mad, don't get mean
[Nelly Furtado]
Don't get mad, don't be mean
[Timbaland]
Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
[Nelly Furtado]
Don't get mad, don't be mean

[Timbaland]
Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

[Nelly Furtado]
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

[Timbaland]
Bring that on?!
[Nelly Furtado]
You know what I mean
[Timbaland]
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

[Timbaland]
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

[Nelly Furtado]
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin ya' name
But you're driving me crazy, the way you're making me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more



[Verse 1]
In the day
In the night
Say it right
Say it all
You either got it
Or you don't
You either stand or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

[Hook]
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel I could show
You tonight you tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really want to go?



[Verse 1]
You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

[Hook]
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

[Verse 2]
Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

[Hook]
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is

[Verse 3]
It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me
Each and every single day I know
I'm going to have to eventually give you away
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
Hey I'm just scared
That we may fall through

[Hook]
I'm like a bird
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird



[Intro]
You're 100% right, Chris!
Time release the fresh!
Time release the fresh!

[Hook 1]
The bigger, the better
The bigger, the better
The bigger, the better
The better, the bigger
(Repeat a few times)

[Verse 1]
Tonight is the jam, I'll be there till dawn
I'm going down, I got my Big Hoops on
Pantlegs so wide, I got my backpack on
I'm gonna hear my favorite song
Hey, hey, hey - What's The Scenario?
That boy keeps passing me by
I said No Diggity, No Doubt
I thought I told you I was Fly
Yeah, he and all of his friends
They-they got that hair like Hi-Five
I don't wanna Talk About Sex
I wanna Express Myself tonight!

[Hook 2]
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

[Hook 3]
Everybody say hey, hey, hey
They going at it all night and day
Everybody say hey, hey, hey
They going at it all night and day
I bet you never seen something like that, like that, like that
I bet ya never heard something like that, like that, like that

[Verse 2]
That boy gonna feel my Poison
I know He Can't Stand The Rain
I don't wanna be down with you, baby
Back and Forth, Back and Forth, Back-Back-Back and Forth
They got my Rump Shakin', I'm Another Bad Creation
I'm real and I never have to fake it, fake it, fake it
You know I gotta' move quick and I gotta move slow
Cause there Ain't No End In The Road

[Hook 2]
[Hook 3]
[Hook 1]

{Beat stops}

[Interlude]
Oh, I thought this song was over
Ha, ha, ha!
Nope, it ain't over yet!

{Beat changes}

[Outro]
I can go fast, I can go fast, I can go fast
I can go fast, I can go fast
I can go slow {chopped and screwed}



[Verse 1]
Honestly, what will become of me?
Don't like reality, it's way too clear to me
But really life is dandy
We are what we don't see, missed everything daydreaming

[Hook]
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to end?
Come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to an end?

[Verse 2]
Traveling I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well the dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Die die die die die

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Well the dogs were barking at a new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day 'til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling on the clouds were dropping and
The rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die



[Chorus]
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live with you through everything
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live in a kaleidoscope
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
Wanna be the one to spin the wheel

[Verse 1]
I know that we can only give
When we have hope
But I wanna live
Without any ghosts
Can't protect me from nothing
Can't save me from the truth
You can't even save me from
You

[Chorus]
So don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna feel the good and bad in everything
Even when it hurts, even when it hurts

[Verse 2]
I know that we can only give
When we got a little hope
But I don't like the burden
Of living with these ghosts
Yes, I will hold my head high
When I walk in your parade
But I will always check my gait
I will always watch my gait

[Bridge]
Pipe dreams
Pipe dreams
Pipe dreams
Pipe dreams
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on



[Verse 1]
Everybody look at me, me
I walk in the door you start screaming
Come on everybody what you here for?
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
I want to see you all on your knees, knees
You either want to be with me, or be me!

[Hook]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Make you fall, real hard in love
She's a Maneater, make you work hard

And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something boy she means it
Even if you never ever seen it
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because, she said she love you, love you long time!

[Intro]
I don’t have an actual bucket list,
I'll panic and think of places I’d like to go…
Greece or Alaska for instance
But no bucket list.
I can think of things I’d like to do,
Ride on a hot air balloon for instance.
Is it bad to make a ‘before I die’ list?
People want to feel like they will surely
Do everything before they die that they dream of.
But deep down maybe we all know it may not happen,
Since you can die at any minute.
We know for sure it would not be desirable to die
Without someone holding your hand.
Dying with someone holding your hand is more valuable
Than going for a skydive, I think.
It’s all perspective. All relative.
All said and done, wanting someone and not pursuing it
Is one of life’s great tortures.
We are mammals after all.
A first kiss with that special someone
Should never be at the bottom of anyone’s bucket list
Because life is simply too short
And before you know it, you run out of time.

[Verse 1]
Climb a mountain, swim the seven seas
Get your body to look like Hercules
Jump out an airplane with a parachute
Fly up and away on a hot air balloon

We don’t know where it all ends
Some say it’s almost over, almost over
If this is it then baby why aren’t I on your shoulder
On your shoulder...

[Hook]
In this lifetime
I want you to be mine
Cuz I took a long look at my bucket list
And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
Whoa I’m running out of time
Whoa I’m running out of time

[Verse 2]
Get on your boots and visit the North Pole
Try every sport until you score a goal
Follow the path of a butterfly
Go to Ground Zero and do nothing but cry.
We don't know how much time left we got left in this world
This beautiful world

[Hook]

[Outro]
And, this is not a dare
Not some trick of a daredevil
I’d trade in my wildest dreams
For your forever

In this lifetime
I want you to be mine
Cuz I took a long look at my bucket list
And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
Cuz I took a long look at my bucket list
And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and
Whoa I’m running out of time
Whoa I’m running out of time
Whoa I’m running out of time
Whoa I’m running out of time



[Timbaland]
It's kind of dark in here, I can't see you, ha
It's kind of dark in here, haha, freaky, freaky, I can't see you
It's kind of dark in here, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I can't see you, freaky
It's kind of dark in here, freaky, freaky, freaky, aha, I can't see you

	[Timbaland]
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl

	[Nelly Furtado]
It's gettin so lonely inside this bed
To know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
There's an aching inside my head
It's telling me you're better off alone
After midnight (ooh) morning will come
& the day will see if you will get some

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams (turn off the lights girl)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems (turn off the lights girl)

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
I looked above the other day (turn off the lights girl)
Cos I think I'm good and ready for a change (turn off the lights girl)
I live my life by the moon, by the moon (turn off the lights girl)
If it's high play it low if it's harvest go slow and if it's full then go
After midnight (ooh) morning will come
& the day will see if you're gonna get some

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams (turn off the lights girl)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems (turn off the lights girl)

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
I'm searching for things that I just cannot see (turn off the lights girl)
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me, yeah

	[Ms. Jade]
I've been through many things
I've seen a lot of faces
A lot of you bet they peep begged up by many cases
It ain't my skin it's my will I'm a win
Right a will till the end
I don't brake fo' the bend
Then again, y'all done begged born shooters
In the streets like scooters, to my shakers and movers
It's looking for the green
Everything ain't what it seems
A different scene lanes leaving em with a VA lean
It ain't no magic we living up in the real world
Real deal represent for my real girls
I know it's lonely at the top and I might fall
As for now, follow the rules and turn them lights off

	[Timbaland]
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl

	[Nelly Furtado]
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light



[Verse 1]
Mother, just lay your head down
You've been burning both ends of the candle and you're done
It's time to find your wings again and turn your face towards the sun
Some battles can't be won

[Chorus]
Like a phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix
Rising from the flame

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again

[Verse 2]
Oh, brother, your hands are tired
You've been holding the world up and you're losing your grip
If you knew now what you knew then, maybe you'd be whole again
But everyone falls down

[Chorus]
Like a phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix
Rising from the flame

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again

[Bridge]
You built a castle in the clouds
But then the fire burned it down
You're still standing anyway
A ll you needed from the start
Was waiting there inside your heart to be born again

[Chorus]
Like a phoenix
Like a phoenix
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright again
