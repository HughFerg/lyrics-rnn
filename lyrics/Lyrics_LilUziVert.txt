Got every girl, ain't no toppin' my hoes (yah!)

Open your legs and I keep 'em closed
Livin' life on the edge, on a tightrope

Drive a new 'Rari, I don't need a note (skrrr!)
Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo

Don't really like her, we friends for the most
Cuban link tri-color, all on my choker(skrrr!)
Don't leave the crumb, got the bread, then you toast
If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
I put a coat on top of my coat
Only 20 minutes before the show (show)

 [Intro]
I can be anything
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book
I can be anything
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book

[Verse 1]
Nowadays these niggas got tellin' ways
She like me when I was broke, now I am hella paid
Gettin' more money than that nigga that's sellin' weight
I can not hear y'all, loud radio, heavy bass
I get dough, pastries like I'm sellin' cake
Smoke gas 'til I levitate
You ain't never smoke that Jet Fuel
I got that from Uncle Snoop (yeah)
I kept that shit one seventy-five, like seven quarters
I fuck so much that I probably got like seven daughters
Boy you move too quick just like a rabbit
Run the game like tortoise
Fuck her to the morning
I think I'm immortal
I think I'm an alien
And got sent straight down from a portal (yeah)
Touch it from the back
And I swear that I won't record you (yah, yah)
Baby I'm not normal
Baby I'm not normal (no way)
They don't like us because we not normal
We can do anything and I won't bore you
It don't matter to you but you know I can afford you

[Verse 2]
I could build your confidence as you build mine
You like me, I will love you always until the end of time
It seems like that I'm always on that thin line
Like 808s & Heartbreak, Kanye with a little hentai
Samurai Jack on a journey, on my lonely, always rockin' Vêtements
They asked me can I rap, man can I?
But I chose to be a sharp shooter like Chris Benoit
Drivin' in that Lamb, I remember when my mom took me to PennDOT
Fucked a girl from Sweden, then I sent her ass to Denmark
Fucked a girl from L.A., and I left her ass right there
Of course you rock with me 'cause I just came out this year
But I'ma see if you really fuck with me if you listening next year
Countin' all my bands up
Go 'head, throw your hands up
Throw your... yeah
Go 'head throw your hands up
Mad because their...
Mad because their only chance up
Yeah your only chance up
And I really did it
You know I really did it

Money so tall can't fold
Come to your house, kick in the door
Walking around with a bank roll
I done made a mil' in the trap house
Bad bitch but she got a good mouth
I do not kiss and we fuck on the couch
You cuffing I'm kicking em out
Bust down, Bust down, Bust down
Pinky ring, pinky ring, bust down, I'm sipping on Actavis now
Smoking OG by the pound, On a PJ for the Rico
My hoe is too foreign she closing the borders, illegal
Don't fuck with you people, it's QC the label
Bitch take a look at these chains
For the fame I'm still the same
In the kitchen I'm whipping that same thang
That Audemars 50k plain jane

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]

All that I know is that I been waiting long

Fuck 2 every night in 5 days that's a 10 piece
My bitch that I'm with that's a 10 piece

Ridin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and just little old me
Fuck I'ma do wit this money
But walk in the club and start stuntin'
Push all my old bitches buttons

Tell her take the stick, don't run from me
There's some for you, there's some for me
So if we have this 3 some, make sure you cum for me
All that bullshit is up under me
Smokin' gas ain't no tumble weed
All of this cash that's another thing
Black and yellow like a bumblebee

Told her to lick it ima stick it ima hit it

No I do not know why all these girls be trippin

Diamonds they water look like the border that mean Pacific

Move the foreign yeah you cannot beat me so I am not missin

Watcha know about them millions

Boy better mind yo business

She can't get in my feelings

? Sometimes I like to kick it

No I kept on feeling

 [Verse 1]
I buy a rollie, my dog he buy a Audemars
Cop off, cop off, we havin' a copoff
You the type off nigga to tip a cop off
Miami nights and I'm riding with the top off
Two bitches on my dick they havin a top off
Have em screamin' in the ghost, phantom of the Opera
Please excuse all these diamonds in my Tic-Toca
All this gold on me lookin' like a fuckin' Oscar
You claim you Thug but you friends with the judge
And that tellin' shit yeah its probably your honor
And I'm finna put a slug up in a pretender cause these haters'll be the one that'll be the main jocker
And I'm colder than winter but
I'ma  winter shop at Lenox  ATL balling with my whole damn blocka
Don't owe a nigga or a bitch shit
All my old hoes actin' like they miss me
But they need to stop it
Now they found out I got a few dollars
Now they wanna holler
But I still make a bitch chew and swallow
Sippin' champagne out the motherfuckin' bottle

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

[Verse 2]
Feel like Triple-Six Mafia, all I see is demons
That bitch ain't on a boat, all she see is seamen
Four-hundred dollars for a brand-new Gucci beanie
Whip it up like pasta, eat it up like a linguini
Oops, I flexed I’m sorry
I ain’t even mean it
Oops, I flexed I’m sorry
I ain’t even mean it
See it then I get it
If I want it, already have it
Diamonds on my Rollie, AP flooded like a Patek

[Bridge]
I knew that I
I wouldn't make up
Time is racin'
I have patience
I wear the, Cartier, these ain't ray-bans
Why you fakin'
Why you hatin'

[Chorus]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

[Outro]

 [Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah
Luv is Rage
Lil Uzi
Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi
Yeah

[Verse]
Boy, you disgust me
Why is yo bitches so ugly?
My bitch so perfect, she kinda look Asian (yeah)
Come all the way from Toronto
All she do is sucky-sucky
My stomach problem from all of this muddy
No money problems ‘cause I’m gettin’ money (money)
This shit is crazy, it just started for me
I was just home, broke, doin’ the dougie
Pinky ring, water-flooded
Wrist got cold yellow diamond runnin’
Grab a tissue if it is an issue (damn)
Used to grab a pistol
No, I didn’t for them itty-bitty niggas
I’m from the city with real killers
Nigga Gilly said, “ya’ gon’ win now”
Uzi countin’ all these major figures
Getting money, got a major hitter
But I ain’t talkin’ Barry Bonds (yeah)
When I was younger, wanted Keri Hilson
Nigga like Dennis the Menace
Now my money old like Mr. Wilson (yeah)
Sneak dissing, who you? The records be missing
I fuck with Hit-Boy, I’m tryna be a hitman
Takin’ yo ass straight out of existence
Where is yo hitman? The other man got him
Shout out Jodye Flacko, fuck wit’ your album
Moving them pigeons, them birds, they be flockin’
White bitch on my dick, she ride like a ‘Rari
When I get rough, she crank that like a cock-shift
She shake her ass on my dick like a cocktail
I could’ve fucked your bitch right in L.A
SLS, she play with my Carter case
I had put some money right in the safe
Didn’t do nothin’, was high, it was late
But we still talk on the phone everyday
About goin' on that perfect date
She hear my name, pussy on percolate
Only date if my dick all in her face (woo)
Wait, 4-5, that’s all on my waist (all on my waist)
Wait, why these niggas in the way?
Why do these niggas be frontin’
They just be there with no office
Most of they’re parents be owning they office
That both of my parents pray more than less often
My old bitch always be gaggin’ and coughin’
My new bitch, she swallow me up so jawless
I want the money, the fame, and the barbie
You know, the white bitch that look like iCarly
She ride my dick like that bitch is a Harley (skrrt)
I just got Energy jewels that was counterfeit (counterfeit)
Clock rounds like my VVS diamond wrist
Everything real, so keep on watchin' it (watchin' it)
If you watchin' me, then you watchin' it (you watchin' it)
My new bitch asked where is the profit for this (profit for this)
Gettin' money really ain't no option, bitch (no option)
Watch your mommy and the lie detectors said (oh)
Boy, I swear you did not write the script (oh)
Never really was a fan, though
Four-door coupe, open just like a sandal
We used to pray for them Lambos
I take my girl to a private resort
Heard we walk 'round wearin' sandals
My bitch so bad, she a handful
That's why she treat me so good
Wake up the pussy and eggs, they be scrambled
Everything lit
Everything, everything, everything lit
Everything lit like a candle
Ohh, she gave me head like some dandruff
Everything, it is so random
Love and rage, it is so random
Love and rage, it is so random




 [Verse]
Yeah
I don't wanna throw these bands
Know that she will drop it low, when she do her dance
Turn around, girl (yeah) on a handstand
I don't really want her, but I'm 'bout to throw these bands
I don't really want her, but I'm 'bout to throw these bands
You took your girl out to eat, she wanna get a tan
So I swooped in first, I see you took her to the sand, yeah
I don’t really want her, but I'm 'bout to throw these bands (yeah)
All jump in a Lamb
Move that car fast (yeah), fast as I can
[?], fast as you can
Fast as you can, fast as you can
Told that girl drop it low, fast as you can
Fast as you can (yeah), fast as you can

 [Intro]
And I...
Want you to know something very important
Before I even start this song
Something very important before I even start this song
I can't feel no more, no
I can't feel no more
I told myself that I wasn't gonna pop no pills no more
No, I can't feel no more
I can't...

[Chorus]
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel
My body's numb
Baby because I am so hurt
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me, was my time worth it?
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round, yeah
Living life just with a curse, before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, ooh
Now a days I gotta swerve you
I took you out of those fur boots

[Verse 1]
Back then I saw no one but you
Gave you my racks and I splurged too
Calling my phone and I curved you
Hope this song really don't hurt you
AP froze, time so slow, yeah, hit reverse
Margiela all on my coat
Got buttons, but leaving it open
So they can all see my shirt, Rick Owens all on my shirt
I can't believe I made it out the dirt
That was back then when my pockets was hurt
Pockets so stuffed that them shits still be hurtin’
Walk with the Goyard, they say its a purse
Louis scarf on me it look like a curtain
My main girl a doctor, my side girl a nurse
They keep on talkin' (woah)
They keep on talkin' (they hatin)
All these girls up in the club, why you lookin' at Vert?
I am not worried because when my niggas come
They gonna need a white curtain
Your boyfriend hate my "Bad And Boujee" verse
She gave me head so I called her a nerd

[Chorus]
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel
My body's numb
It because I am so hurt
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me, What's my time and worth?
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yeah
Living life just with a curse
Before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Now a days I gotta swerve you
I took you out of the fur boots

[Verse 2]
I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
No girl don't make a sound
You don't wanna argue about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
What is all this fighting all about
It's the bodies that I'm finding out
It's the bodies I don't know about
So many bodies like a murder trial
You used to say that it's word of mouth
But I love you so you're bondin' out
But I love you so you're bondin' out
Grandma and Mom love you now
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
Hate me then, but they love me now
Love me then, but they hate me now
It don't matter, got the paper now
I'm so numb

[Chorus]
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, my body's numb
It because I am so hurt
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me, what's my time and worth?
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yeah
Living life just with a curse
Before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Now a days I gotta swerve you
I took you out of the fur boots

[Outro]
I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
I can't feel

 [GG Allin]
Where other people stop, I accelerate. People say they're gonna do shit, and they don't do it. I'm going all the way with it, the ultimate rock and roll sacrifice is death. When I die, I don't die, my soul goes on, it's another invention. A bottle of death is exciting. Why do I wanna get old and be... nothing? Why do I want to be a poor human being? I wanna do what I wanna do, and get everything done as quick as I gotta do it, and get the fuck out of there, go on, and then I can accelerate into the next life, and still leave my blood here, to be the blood of rock and roll, and still be here, I'll never go away. But when I'm dead, I will become stronger on Earth, and I'll become more powerful in the next life. There is no death, if I kill myself, that doesn't solve the mission, at all. The mission goes on and on and on, and people are so fucking stupid they don't understand that, they don't understand they think "Yo okay, you're gonna kill yourself, well that's stupid." Well you're fucking wrong, you're stupid for getting fucking old and boring and ignorant just like people on the jury that convicted me. I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna be part of your fucking boring world, I wanna do what I wanna do, when I wanna end my life, I'm gonna fucking end it, and I'm gonna be more powerful for it. And, and, all you people who say what I'm doing is wrong, you're just so fucking... insecure, that you don't have the fucking balls to do it. You wanna say you're bad but you don't really wanna fucking be bad, you just wanna pretend you are. Well I'm really gonna fucking do it and that's what separates the real rock and roll underground from the people who wanna just be pretend. Y'know bands, they come along and follow what I do and imitate what I do. I'm not just-

'Cause, cause let me know, let me... let me tell you why
'Cause you're not a man of your word
That's - that's the reason why. So let's talk about it

Pull up coupe, two small chairs
Took that girl right in the club
Felt the booty and it's all there
So smooth so its all nair
Heard she talk to a ball player (what?) It's cool
Heard she talk to a ball player but you know I keep it all player
And I heard he ain't a star player

[Verse 2]
I was in a dream, yeah I used to dream

Now I'm in reality, don't need those

Real ones can't die, only multiply
I know something it ain't right, how you put me to the side?
When I called your phone, yeah, you said I was lying (lying?)
How am I lying? I just pulled up to my show
I'm still on the grind

I got all types of hoes, some of them love 'em
Most of them don't, some of them suck dick
Some of them won't
Some of them humble and some of them flaunt
And some of them skinny, but most of them thick
Got college bitch and she major in dick
Got me a bitch used to be a Crip and she still got the 40 on her hip
Got me a bitch that love to suck dick and it's kinda funny, she got a lisp
And I got me a bitch that love designer bitch
Love that Givenchy and love that Saks 5th
Got me a bitch, she with the shit
Mushrooms and acid she stay off a trip

Fizzy murder, he a shotta and I wanna be like Silk Da Shocker
And I made a lot of different of profits
Went from the noodles to the steak and the salads

And she played it cool and kept it smooth (kept it smooth, yeah)
Instagram the only way you knew (way you knew)

Kept it g but I guess it didn't work (didn't work, yeah)
Loyalty the only thing that hurt (thing that hurt, yeah)

[Chorus - Lil Uzi Vert]
I don't really care if you cry

Walk around, Cuban link, my Patek is flooded
Now my pockets super deep, flooded with them hundreds (ooh!)
Flooded with them hundreds (damn!)
Flooded with them hundreds
What you thought it was?

[Verse 1]
And it's sixteen-hundred
Try to take my soul my young niggas they coming
I remember when they said that I was nothing
I can't trust my brother, I can't trust my cousin
No, let me take my time
I want every girl like I can't make my mind
I spent eighty-thousand just to flood the time
I don't wear no Hanes, my T-shirt Saint Laurent

I still got some boys sad, moving bags of the dope
Yeah you know I got that cash, you get blast on the low
Just because you knew my dad don't mean that I play you close

[Hook]
So much water on my neck might need a boat or something
So many different girls I got a load of 'em (yeah!)

Can't do nothing around you 'cause we know you 'gone tell
Niggas I grew up with got a five-star room in Hell
Wait, cause they not loyal
Can't believe we grew up in the soil

And that's rich nigga welps (I'ma beat your fuckin' ass)
I done did it on my own, trappin' out the phone
I been takin' Xannies, they got me so gone
I say she ain't got no panties, look like Nia Long
Thinkin' we should go Miami, when I made this song
I swear that I do the randomness, I must be in love
I swear I'm smokin' on cannabis, it's all in my lungs
Fuck with me, you feel these hollow tips, that was in my gun
Made a million, I was by myself, diamonds like the sun

[Hook]
Flexin', finessin' different deals

[Verse 2]

Countin' these dollars and countin' these rolls
And she workin', she ridin' the pole

I do not never keep up with hoes
I just change them like I change my clothes

[Hook]
Flexin', finessin' different deals

 She super bad and she Persian
Hatin' on my swag, I'm a make it worse
I won't pop them tags, I'm a make it worse
Watch me do the dash, I'm a make it worse




 [Chorus]
No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It’s funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

[Verse 1]
They know she's mine ’cause I rule her
She says he does fine but I'm cooler
I got way more diamonds than your jeweler
All my girls dress like they work at Hooters
First I get my racks and then I backpack
No, I don't subtract, I might just add that
Did it on my own, no, you can't tax that
This that under the table, you can't track that

[Bridge]
Put money ahead and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth

[Chorus]
No one wants to die alone
They don’t wanna miss the show
It’s funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Now it seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

[Verse 2]
Over you, yeah
I got two so you know that I can’t lose ya
Moving my savages, you know my boys 'gone shoot, yeah
Came to the club on my solo tryna groove, yeah
Just keep on walking, it is nothing just to prove, yeah
Who him? His diamonds fake, and he can't fool us
You know it's Christian Dior all up on my shoes, yeah
White stripes on the arm of my Thom Browne suit
You know I pull up and I got my tool tucked
You know that I don’t go nowhere without my ruler
You know everything that I said was for the mula
I swear that me and your love's dead called the movers

[Chorus]
No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
Don't seem to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over
Seems to be over

[Bridge]
Put money ahead and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth

[Outro]
I told that girl pull up her skirt
I am so hot that I don't wear no shirt
Talk about me, you fuck 'round go get murked
Reject your bitch with my dick when she jerk
I hit it first, Lil Uzi Vert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert




 [Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Super geeked up, walking on a tight rope
She think she in love but just wants my dough
I know from the fame, all these girls are psycho
Driving in the lamb, swerving round the potholes
Know I got my gun everywhere that I go
Tatted on my face, I look like a psycho
She think she in love but just want my dough
I know from the pain, all these girls are psycho
Damn I feel like a mobster, rocking my suit like a model
None of these girls is my problems, none of these girls is my problems
Good girls say you ain't swallow, good girls say you ain't swallow
Numb to the pain cause of addys, only way you rather die

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Hey, I don't got no form of pain
All of these girls the same , whos the one to blame
Nowadays you not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I get your girl in my wraith
I hit your girl in my wraith
In a space ship outer space
Geekin' on Mars yesterday
Now I'm on Pluto today
I look at the moon at it's face
I look at the moon at it's face
Me and the moon related
Me and the moon related
Me and the moon related
Me and the moon related

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I gotta stack up my cake
Getting them chips like it's lays
Man my donuts like it's glazed
Man my donuts like it's glazed
You know she told me you lame
Me and you boy not the same
Don't give a fuck what you think
1600 what I claim

[Interlude: Lil uzi Vert]
Bah! Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
My niggas aim at your brain
Nowadays these niggas do anything just for the fame
You got a stick, I got the chopper, these bitches don't hit the same
Don't be the same, what are you sayin'
What is you saying, turned to a fool with the K
Turned to a fool with the K
Get this girl out of my face
Rarri go fast, a race

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Hey, I don't got no form of pain
All of these girls the same, who is the one to blame
Nowadays you not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I get your girl in my wraith
I get your girl in my wraith
In a space ship outer space
Geekin' on Mars yesterday

Ooh, swim in it, ooh, let me touch it
Turn around girl, let me bust it
Running back, running back, rush it
Yeah, in Atlanta, like I'm TJ Duckett
Dior suit, take the arm and I cuff it
Trust no one for nothing, run up and they bust it
Take xans 'til I stumble, full bars now I punt 'em
Look she brung her friends they wanna tumble

Baby girl turn around

Met a girl there she work at Follies
Met a girl that work at Magic City
The girl at follies she got the titties
The girl at Magic she got the body
On the real neither one of them fifty
Neither one of these girls get me, yuh

Lil Uzi don't move with no twenties
Funny thing is you really don't move with money
You still move with them tens and them fives
You still move with those nickels and dimes
You took that girl to um meet your mom
But I fucked that girl right on the come
Put them girls all in a line, boy, I'm not lyin'

Huh, run it, run it, bitch, run it, yeah

Run it, run it, run it

 [Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Admit it, I move like amoeba
I float in the room like I'm reefer
Alien, I’m not your kind of people
Telepathic, fam watch how I read ya (Skateboard)
You ain't got emeralds greener
You ain't got rich up the sleeve
And I got a Rolls that’s in the Grove
That I ain't drove, shit, I don't know the reason (305)
Andele, andele, arriba
Me and J Balvin on G5
Success is a drug and man we high
I am OTHER is a beehive
I got love for you haters
Ain't you tired of enslavement?
Come with us, make some paper
Cause you should own what you labor

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, you never stayed in Kailua (Hawaii)
I put Chanel on my shooter
Flooded my chain and it's Gucci
I don't want that girl, she moody
I'm basically saying I'm cooler
Get Dior discounts from my cougar
Back in the sixth grade I got them bad grades
I was in love with my tutor
See, musically, Lil Uzi trapping man
Most of you rappers be actors man
Go M.I.A when I find little Madison
Stay at the Ritz-Carlton, this not the Radisson
Just took a blue one, ’bout to take the red pill
Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don’t spill
Stay with a nerd just like Urkel, Jaleel
Fresh just like Carlton, I kill em with Will
Big ass "R” on my Smiths
Big ass “R” on my whips
Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip
Said she kinda fine if she got some hips
Momma said, "Let me see the witch
Boy you know light and dark don’t mix
Mix it up, boy, bad luck"
Sick to my stomach with them neon guts

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Lil Uzi Vert]
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energy, we don't touch
Our jewelry's beyond Tut
And It give a nigga colorful aura like I got neon guts
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energies, we don't touch
Our jewelry’s beyond Tut
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah fam, Pharrell on Mars with my fellow star
I'm like lightning striking in a metal rod
I say, "Hello God" in the devil bars
So dammit, Amex, I got a yellow card

[Verse 4: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yellow card, yellow card
Damn, P, I need a yellow car
I am from the root like where the petal start
I had to push like a pedal start
Started way after but ahead of y'all
New crib, got a better yard
Two years, I got hella cars
Since the eighth grade had hella broads
Hella broads, hella broads
Yellow painting with a yellow brush
Shit came from KAWS, probably marge
Slick my hair back like I'm Chico DeBarge
I got some lights on my chest
Don't confuse it with a heart
Heard things ain't looking too good for you
Had to pull some strings like I play the harp
I get these millions alone
It been that way from the start
Smoking good kush, my cologne
Got neon guts 'cause I can't see in the dark

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Lil Uzi Vert]
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energy, we don't touch
Our jewelry's beyond Tut
And it give a nigga colorful aura like I got neon guts
Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
Dark energy, we don't touch
Our jewelry's beyond Tut
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts
And I got a colorful aura like I got neon guts

Now I gotta keep my [?]
Yeah, my Glock

Yes I'm in my own world, I am the president
If you wanna get to me you gotta register
All blue cheese on me, not the type in the register
I don't think it really register
Nowadays I'm not regular
I get all my drugs over the counter pass the register
I fucked with her brains and you know I can't have sex with her
Diamonds in my rings so you know I gotta check with her

[Hook]
Get them bands, now run it up
Get them bands, now run it up
Stack my bands then run it up
All blue bands like nothing else
Bitch, I’m good, I’m a hundred now
Don’t move less than a hundred ‘round
She want me, she in love now
All my cups they drugged out
When she chill with me she say that’s a touchdown
She can’t believe she gon’ touch now
Smoking that herb and get bust down
I cannot get stuck now yeah
Diamonds all in my bust down
Big boy ‘bout to get left out
Hate on me get checked out

[Verse 2]
Heard that boy really got guap and he went and just left town
Came back with the big ol' Lex now
Big old Heart feel like the best now
I can make that boy go back to his hoe
And then blow it up that is a let down
Fucked them but I can't just rest now
Think I'm worried bout being blessed now?
I ain't tryna be a let down
12 undercover in dress downs
Talked to my momma, can rest now
You want the drama get pressed now
Met the real Drama, a let down
They look at me like a check now
Used my head, I'm the best hands down
I'm the one fuck up they plans now
Boy I swear I get you ran down
Me and my street always land down
Free my boys that's in the can now
They free'd em all now they all hands down
She look at me from a glance
She look at me from a glance now
I had this girl in a trance now
Before she know wet in her pants now
Too much bank, gotta new account
Big boy knots, that's a big amount
Bend her right over, put it in her mouth
Don't wanna fuck, put it in her mouth
Diamonds on my neck, hit like blue mound
X her right out she had to sniff the white mount
Bitch I'm on the gang, turned ya right now
Ecstasy with a 'shroom right now
Put the perc in me, level right out
Don't wanna fuck, let her right out
I didn't wanna fuck anyway, just wanted her to see my new house
Want to see what her sweet tooth 'bout
Proceed to give me that mouth
Percy Miller bitch I swear I'm bout it bout it
Three years ago, Goyard wallet
Big BackWood full with Gelato
Light it up with a Goyard lighter
Lyrical dope hoe jarivs
These niggas steal my flow man they liars
These niggas my clones anybody
Nigga like me, oh I can't allow it
Bitch I'm off a bean, bustin' off a molly
I can feel this shit in my body
Yeah
Keep it a bean you ain't really ridin'
Keep it a bean you ain't really slimin'
Everywhere I go a camera on me, so I ain't really high
Plus 1 turn a 2 into a minus
Bitch I feel like I'm the one
Bitch I feel like I'm the prophet
No everything led to mine
I feel like Ojo
I feel like new Kanye
I feel like new Jay
When I count new profit
I count that old money, just to get new guns
That's for the blue ones
That's for the red fifties
I get them dead digits

He talk to the feds with it

I heard that he dead snitchin' (I heard)

Diamonds all in my bust down
Big boy ‘bout to get left out
Hate on me get checked out
