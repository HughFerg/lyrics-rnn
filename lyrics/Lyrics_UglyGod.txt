 [Intro]
Young Ugly God, bruh
The title explains everything, nigga
I don't got to say shit

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Interlude]
And don't even act like this message is just for the boys
Girls y'all be looking at ass, too. I be seeing y'all
But you know when you see a big thick booty bitch in the mall
You can't do shit but just look at that booty from a distance

[Verse 1]
Booty from afar, same difference
Young Ugly God spot your booty from a distance
20/20 vision, nigga, I know I ain't trippin'
I just saw a booty from a whole 'nother district
I'm walking in my Sketchers ready for whatever
Booty from a distance, bitch I'm finna bring the pressure
Never disrespect the booty treat it like a treasure
Never disrespect the booty listen to your elders
40 booties from a distance, damn I must be dreamin
I sense another booty from a whole different region
Booty from a distance got me feeling like a demon
Never cuff a bitch, my hoes change like the seasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 2]
Young Ugly God explore the booty like a forest
My teeny weeny dick came hard like my chorus
Little Dick Clique and I don't wanna be enormous
I open up the booty like a god damn thesaurus
My name is Ugly God but all my hoes is gorgeous
Hoes on my dick cause I just got a abortion
Ugly God get three hoes and have a foursome
I'm ugly but my self esteem higher than your mortgage
Booty from a distance I see booty out in orbit
I could fuck your bitch but your momma more important
Made your bitch come out her shell like a tortoise
Young Ugly God make these other rappers forfeit

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

If you ain't talking money get up out my face
And I'm with it 'bout my money I won't play
And I know they really wanna see me quit
'cause I'm walkin' 'round looking like a lick
And your mad 'cause my jewelry cost a brick
When I'm really on all I need is open six

[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Ayy, diamonds on my chain, make you feel some type of way
Talk down on my name you might lose your life today
Keep it sticky, huh, gave his bitch a hickey, huh
I pull up with the pump, up it like he Ricky, huh
Nigga's shitty, huh, smoke 'em like a hippie, huh
I pull up with the glizzy, up it in a jiffy, huh

But I just want that top, you can keep that kitty, huh. (keep that, keep that)

If you toes look good
I'm trying to get yo' number bitch
I don't care about ya' problems
Or what's goin' on at home
It don't matter how you dress
Don't give a fuck about ya' clothes
I don't care about ya' heart
Nor do I care about ya' soul
All I care about is face titties booty and ya' toes

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
Ugly God came in, dick game malicious
If I come over better know I'm on a mission
Booty so delicious but yo' toes look suspicious
Face titties booty toes, damn you finger lickin'

Pleased to meet you, would you like to be one of my bitches
Lock me in ya' titties, bitch I wanna be in prison

Your networth say you got a million, but your ass don't
You a one hit wonder, bitch, your whole career a joke
Back in 10th grade, your coach kicked you off the team
Every single day, you wear them same pair of jeans
Them same black pants, bitch, you know which ones I mean
Four years ago, you got jumped on Halloween

[Chorus]
Fuck Ugly God (what?)

Water this, water that, you finna get exposed
Back in eighth grade, you use to borrow niggas' clothes
You act like a freak, but you ain't never sucked no toes
You still owe your college three bands in student loans
You don't got no hoes, everyday you beat your meat
You don't want these problems, pussy boy, you know you weak
When I catch you slipping, I'm gon' punch you in your teeth
Ugly God a bitch, pussy boy don't want no beef

[Chorus]
Fuck Ugly God (what?)
Fuck Ugly God (what?)

Ugly God A.K.A. Nigga Too Nasty
Come here baby put your phone number in my gadget

Young Ugly God toss yo booty like a salad
Same shoes everyday but bitch I'm still swaggin'
Motherfuck yo fashion, I could win a beauty pageant
Ugly God a legend, take notes in yo tablet
I'm ugly as the fuck, but bitch I'm still a coochie magnet
37 booties in my face, boy what's happenin'
TV screen, shawty on the scene like an actress
My hair on point but my clothes stay ratchet
Young Ugly God, bitch my dick game disastrous

[Chorus]
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe

[Outro]
Thanks Ugly God!




 [Chorus: PnB Rock]
Say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
You say you always gon' be by my side
You say you trust me with your heart and I swear, I just wonder why
Say "I'm done with this," you tell me "Don't go"
Shawty, I ain't tryna hurt you no more
But you say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die

[Verse: Ugly God]
I be up, I'm a go-getter
What I'm doin', baby, no tellin'
You the shit, you can do so better
But I'm a dog, you should have known better
Like why the fuck you love me? huh
I be gone for weeks, why the fuck you trust me, huh
I sneak out while you sleep, why the fuck you cuff me, huh
Like what the fuck you think, you act like a dummy, huh
Ayy, you catch me slippin' every time, I know it hurt
I been out, I know you smell it on my shirt
I'm a dog, but I want this shit to work
But I'm tryna fuck on every bitch that's tryna flirt

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
You say you always gon' be by my side
You say you trust me with your heart and I swear, I just wonder why
Say "I'm done with this," you tell me "Don't go"
Shawty, I ain't tryna hurt you no more
But you say you love me, shawty, tell me why
'Cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die

[Outro: Ugly God]
Ayy, 'cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die
Mm, 'cause I'm a dog and I'ma probably be this way until I die




 Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Thanks, Ugly God

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I call a flight with your wife
I spent that price on my ice
She say, my diamonds on fleek
I pull up and fuck up her life
Watch how I thumb, through these bands
Now these hoes wanna be nice
All of these bitches is trife
Bitch, get the fuck out my life

[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Now, that my name big on a banner
Bitch, look at my glamour, my middle name tanner
Fuck Donald Trump, 'cause I trap Bernie Sanders
Talk down on me, you'll get hurt for the slander
I got your bitch and she wet like a tidal wave
Run up on me and I might take your life away
I bust a nut in your microwave
Bitch, I'm the shit, I stay lit like a fireplace
I'm Ugly God and I'm the undertaker, I'ma find your bitch and I'ma funnel cake her
Bitch, I'm rich, I got a ton of paper, I'ma fuck your bitch and get her number later
But wait, all of these bitches want cake, all of these niggas is snakes
I'll take your bitch to my place, I'll knock it down and I'll shake

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I call a flight with your wife
I spent that price on my ice
She say, my diamonds on fleek
I pull up and fuck up her life
Watch how I thumb, through these bands
Now these hoes wanna be nice
All of these bitches is trife
Bitch, get the fuck out my life

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Hunnid grand for my initials
I'm not the one the one with the pistols
So I'm not the one you be watching
I'm [?], like the watchmen
Everyone is a lame, [?], like I'm undercover
Grab the shit, in the bag, break it up, fuck the cops
It's yellow time, fuck a funk shine, got a mini fridge full of rave
She [?], like it's ring
She wanna fuck on the team
Got a bad bitch from the Southside, all a nigga hear is "ring, ring"
So all she hear is "ching, ching"
And all she want is bling, bling
Lil' Boat

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I call a flight with your wife
I spent that price on my ice
She say, my diamonds on fleek
I pull up and fuck up her life
Watch how I thumb, through these bands
Now these hoes wanna be nice
All of these bitches is trife
Bitch, get the fuck out my life




 [Chorus]

Sippin' lemonade but I still double up the Styrofoam
Pull up to your crib and serve you up like I was Domino's
Then I hit your bitch, she feel the dick all in her collarbone
Pull up on your bitch and turn her on just like a flashlight
She keep comin' back, she blow my dick just like a bagpipe
Niggas tough on Instagram, but in person they act right
I do this with no effort, I know these niggas mad tight

[Chorus: Ugly God & Splash Drexler]
Yeah, I'm walkin' down the strip with your bitch, I'ma rub her hip

Me and your bitch booted up at the Waffle House, hope that she ain't anemic (yuh)
Money counter beepin', need a red Hellcat
Push that bitch like a demon (push that ho)

Look me face to face, don't tell no lie
Get your shit together, please don't throw me to the side
Don't pay me no mind, if you just gon' waste my time
You hear this all the time but I think you should be mine (with your sexy ass)
Ain't no rush, take your time be patient
Tell the truth, save them lies goodness gracious
Lizard Man, Ugly God, Pussy Bacon
Booty Gang, underground sensation

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?

Eyes low it might look like I'm Korean
Diamond chain it look like somebody peeing
Hoes know, niggas know so they don't try me
Keep it on me, never know these niggas grimy
Playstation, Dreamcast how I be ballin'
No games, fucked your bitch now she callin'
Six rings, I'm the best like I'm Jordan
No look, catch the pass then I'm scorin'

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at

Run it back, hey, ooh, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy
Thanks Ugly God!

[Chorus]
Stop smoking Black & Milds bitch you nasty
How you smoking Blacks but actin' like you classy?
Why you smoking Blacks? Bitch you unattractive
Stop smoking Black & Milds, ho you trashy

[Verse 1]
Stop smoking Black & Milds, with your country ass
You got shit around your mouth, with your crusty ass
You need to go and take a bath, with your musty ass
You need to scrub between your ass, with your dusty ass
Bitch your house got roaches, I ain't going, bitch I can't
Last time we spoke, I smelled your breath, it made me faint
Bitch I hopped up in your Honda Civic, all I smelled was paint
I waited 30 minutes for a jump so we could crank
You can't smoke no Black & Milds and be a fan of me
That ain't your hair I know its weave, bitch stop playing with me
I heard your mama kicked you out, bitch you ain't staying with me
We coolin' now, but bitch in public you ain't friends with me
Bitch your Honda struggling with them dents all in the back
You can hit that head, but I won't let you hit no black
You ain't classy, you ain't shit, but a hood bitch
Why you spent your last dollar on that wood tip?

[Chorus]
Stop smoking Black & Milds bitch you nasty
How you smoking Blacks but actin' like you classy?
Why you smoking Blacks? Bitch you unattractive
Stop smoking Black & Milds, ho you trashy

[Verse 2]
Heard the whole hood hit you from the back
I heard the hood ran a train on your track (choo choo)
I heard your daughter's only toy was a jump rope (yup)
That's the black bitch, stop flexin' like that's blunt smoke

[Outro]
Ayy, stop smoking Black & Milds bitch
Ayy, stop smoking Black & Milds bitch
Ayy, stop smoking Black & Milds bitch
Ayy, stop smoking Black & Milds bitch

Hey, listen up, damn, I had to switch it up
All these bitches blowin' up my phone but I don't pick it up
I'm in first place but you ain't quick enough
You a goon on Instagram, in person you gon' stiffen up

[Verse]
If that booty lookin' good then I might grip that
Ain't no time for no games, bitch, let me hit that
You said you like chocolate, baby, let me be your Kit-Kat
I'm the goat, bitch I drop my own diss tracks, big facts
Fuck your backwood, boy, I can't hit that, ayy
Fuck your double cup, boy, I can't sip that, get that
All that shit you rappin', you ain't with that
Choppa with a scope came with a big kick back, get back
Fuck your house party, fuck your kick back
Let's get to it, ain't no time for no chit-chat, sit back
She suck on my neck just like a Tic-Tac
I'm a dark nigga, I blend in when it's pitch black

[Chorus]
Hey, listen up, damn, I had to switch it up
All these bitches blowin' up my phone but I don't pick it up
I'm in first place but you ain't quick enough
You a goon on Instagram, in person you gon' stiffen up




 [Intro]
Nikko Bunkin in the trap, yuh

[Chorus]
Ayy, I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap, ooh
Take a step back, don't get clapped
I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap, ooh
Take a step back, don't get clapped

[Verse]
Everyday we lit (lit), baby, you the shit (bitch)

Leave him in the ditch (why?) 'cause he a bitch
Drag my name through the dirt, I'm swervin' down and shootin' shit
Lil' groupie bitch, huh, on my dick 'cause I'm super rich
Stupid bitch, I know the game, baby, all I do is trick
Ruler dick, got her crazy on some cuckoo shit

Bitch, I'm for the youth just like Dr. Seuss, huh

[Chorus]
I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap, ooh
Take a step back, don't get clapped
I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap
Take a step back, don't get clapped

[Outro]

 I sleep on your sofa, your bitch got ebola
My wrist Coca-Cola, my dick in a coma
My bitch from Dakota, I'm richer than Oprah




 Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
When I'm on the bus, I sit in the back
When I'm tryna fuck, she gon' give me back
Niggas said I fell off, well bitch I'm back
Spend a couple racks, then I make it back
'Cause I done got rich on these niggas
I blew up and dipped on these niggas
I bought a new whip on these niggas
'Cause I'm really sick of these niggas
Shout out Lil Boat cause I wanna get on a lil' boat and then drip on these niggas
They stealing my wave with the water shit
I was the first one to drip on these niggas
And if by any means if I feel tried, I'ma empty a clip on these niggas

 [Intro: CUFBOYS and CUFBOYS' Mom]
So what's your opinion on Ugly God, mom? A lot of people have wanted me to do that
This two videos we just saw?
Yeah
Oh, good luck to him, because whatever he made off that is not gonna be--no
What you mean?
He's not gonna make any more. That was terrible. I mean, I'm pretty open minded, so I like some of these people. I think they have a future. This guy--number one, he's not that attractive. Number two--he's not! I mean, he's just not that attractive! And then all he wants to sing about is dumb stuff, almost like-- I don't know how to even say it, he's singing like pornographic stuff, and who just wants to see-- I mean, I guess if he has an audience for it, good luck. I would never listen to that
So it's a no? Final opinion on Ugly God?
Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. He's one of the worst you have shown me

[Verse]
I spent that check on my neck
I got yo' bitch drippin', she wet (drip)
Nigga, please don't disrespect
My niggas, they grippin' them TECs
I pull up and pick up that check
I go to yo' crib, put my dick in yo' sister
Yo' bitch on my line, I pull up and I drill her
Don't DM me, nigga, don't hit me on Twitter
Damn, I am the G.O.A.T, admit it (yeah)
I fuck on yo' bitch 'cause she with it
These niggas so broke, I don't get it (the fuck?)
I need me a milli, let's get it
I always say I need a milli
I probably won't stop 'til I cop me a milli
When I touch a milli, I'll cop me a Bentley
So let me stack up 'cause my pockets look empty
You niggas and bitches irrelevant
I need me that check, I pay hella rent
My pockets thicker than a elephant
I do this rap shit for the hell of it
2016, bitch I coulda been President
Bitch I'm the shit, I came up and it's evident
Don't call me brother, no we are not relatives
You niggas are snakes, yuh
These bitches is fake, yuh
I see that you hate, yuh
I count up this cake, yuh (I run up that cash)
You savin' these hoes, lil nigga (the fuck?)
I cannot relate, yuh (cannot relate)
But get you a cape, yuh
Say hey to my tape, yuh, bitch




 [Intro]
RED DRUM on the beat

[Chorus]
Pull up on 'em, smoke 'em like a Optimo

Say it with your chest, nigga, we want all the smoke
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)

Nigga, we want all the smoke (huh, bitch)

[Chorus]
Pull up on 'em, smoke 'em like a Optimo

[Outro]
Thanks Ugly God




 [Verse]
It's the Booty Gang captain
Talkin' shit to me is history
I hit your crib malicious
Charge your bitch just for an entrance fee
Ugly God finesse the booty live on MTV
And slide up in your bitch just like a missing piece
XXL got me acting wild
Now why the fuck you dusty bitches smokin' Black & Milds?
Actin' childish, just give it a rest
I get in her breast easy
Splash on your main bitch and then give her my next CD
I came up off of water like Dasani and Fiji
And I might fuck your main bitch, boy
You just gotta believe me
Young Obama, bitch, I kick it with your bitch in Tahiti
And I'll be beatin' my meat until they impeach me
Slayin' booty since day one, you can't question that
Made my own beats and made some moves and wrote some extra raps
And all the hoes be sayin' that young Ugly God the best at that
So suck my dick on soft and never text me back
