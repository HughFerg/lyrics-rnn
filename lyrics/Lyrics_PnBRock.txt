[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ayy

One day, I'ma buy a big ass mansion (mansion)
One day, all my fucking diamonds 'gon be dancing (bling)
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch in the Hamptons (woot)
One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon (aye)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
One day, I'ma be that nigga like I thought
One day, I'ma buy myself a new foreign car
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch that's a porn star
One day, I'ma fuck a bitch that's a porn star
One day, I'ma fill all the arenas
I'ma be turning up on stage with my demons
I'ma buy the new Gucci suit, it's the cleanest
I'ma play with racks like I'm Venus or Serena
Momma kicked me out and I came back with tattoos
Then she kicked my ass and said boy you a damn fool
I said no, I was on my own, ain't have to ask you
I said no, this what being young and having cash do

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ayy
Momma told me that I wouldn't be shit (momma)

One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon (sushi)

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
One day, I'ma eat the sushi with the salmon
One day, I'ma fuck a groupie in a mansion
One day, I'ma fuck your boo and leave her stranded
One day, I'll be in Peru speaking Spanish
One day, I'ma put my momma in a Bentley
I remember laying down with my stomach empty
Now I'm eating steak and rocking all kinds of Fendi
Spent your rent on my neck, bitch, I'm only 20
Dropped out of college, everybody said I'm tripping
Told 'em be patient, but they ass wouldn't listen
Made it big time, now they fucking with the vision
Now I'm really rich, and my diamonds really glistening

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ayy
Momma told me that I wouldn't be shit (momma)
Told her one day (yeah)

You can kick me out (huh)
I ain't gon' trip (nah)

One day, I'ma buy a big ass mansion (mansion)
One day, all my fucking diamonds 'gon be dancing (bling)

 [Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]

Everybody got them a tool
Everybody think shit a game
Bullets ain't got no name and niggas ain't got no aim

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I need a coupe back from '88
What I spent on my Muller was 88
Robbed a nigga, he was 88
Man I had to do it to keep the baby straight
Dog food had the kitchen stink
.40 Glock and it was nickel plate
I keep it on me 'cause these niggas hatin'
I keep it on me 'cause these niggas hatin'
I can turn a nigga to a gun man
Odell with the draco, shoot one hand
Could've caught a body but the gun jammed
Bullets flyin' through the runnin' man
Rollie watch give 'em sun tan
Dope money in the rubber band
All black like a Uber guy
Shooters hoppin' out the Uber van
I'm a gangster and we all gang-gang for them dead niggas
Bagging 88, free them niggas at the fed nigga
I love my pops, he sold 10 toes and he ain't shared nigga
I'm gettin' higher with the guys, fuck your dead niggas

[Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]
Streets fucked up 'bout 10 right now
Man there ain't no rules

[Verse 2: Lud Foe]
This MAC-11 hold 88
All these rap niggas featherweight
He say he want beef, get a whole plate
The bullets hit you and they penetrate
Got a schedule just for making cake
And I'm always on time, I'm never late
Remember praying for them for them better days
But now we just ball like everyday
If you tryna book me then pick a date
She got a nice ass, I love her face
We pull on a Opp and it's candles out
You would think it was his birthday
My Cinderella is a mermaid
Brought her glass slippers for her birthday
Them hollows leave him with a burst face
And don't fuck with me in the first place
Benjamin Franklin blue face
Jimmy Choo that's what my shoes say
Don't give a fuck about what you say
I'm kickin' the pussy like Lupe
My car go zoom zoom zoom
Panamera it's a coupe day
She a broke bitch with a cute face
So I shoot on her mouth like a toothpaste

[Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]
Streets fucked up 'bout 10 right now
Man there ain't no rules

[Verse]
I woke up with two bitches I don't even know
But I ain't trippin' 'cause when you on that's just how it goes
I woke them bitches up, told one to help me find my clothes
And told the other one look for some weed, then find a dutch and roll
I got my shit together, I watched them kiss each other
I told them I don't wan' fuck, just watch them lick each other
I hit the door, then the show started getting better
Put it on my soul, you wouldn't believe me if I would tell ya
After that situation, brushed my teeth and washed my face and
Told them hoes I had a good time and hopefully I'll see them later
In life, 'cause I know these hoes ain't right

Hold up my phone ringin', contact say Chief Leech
Pick up like what's up, she said meet me on PnB
Just headin' out when I pull up, I see Leech pourin' up

In the studio, I been barely sleepin'
Smokin' all this dope, I been barely eatin'
In a different city every fuckin' weekend

[Verse 2]

 [Verse 1]
Who am I to say no?
To all these bad bitches on my timeline
Telling me that they in love
And they always ask me at the right time
When it's night time
Yea its dark out
Sneak, creep out
Yea thats what i'm talkin' 'bout
Naked pictures in my DM's
Wit' a number and a address to they house

[Bridge]
Maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong head
But I remember

[Hook]
Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

[Verse 2]
But don't you act like
You don't miss the old times
And I don't ever control mine
Don't act like you just dont care
Don't you act like
You don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had
All those good old times we shared
Don't you act (Don't you act)
You don't miss me girl
When we see each other
You don't wanna kiss me girl
I done blown up, I done blown up
And you 'sposed to be with me girl
But people grow, times change like the seasons
And right now I need something to believe in
And for those times that you caught a nigga cheating
For what it's worth it wasn't for no reason

[Bridge]
Cause maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong hitta
I remember

[Hook]
Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

 [Intro]
Aww yeah
From then to now

[Chorus]
Remember back then all them hoes ain't want me
Now I'm ballin', all them same hoes on me
Mama told me that this came with the money
And the mothafuckin' fame, even though I feel the same
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
Yeah I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to take over the game, I done made my own lane
I ain't even gotta say it, everybody know my name
Still gettin' used to the fame, everything so different now
Can't walk to the store without takin' no pictures now
Got love for my fans, they really held me down
I was locked up in a cell, every day they sent me mail
They love me, I can tell, feels good, I made it
Now it's time to turn up for all the niggas that hated
PnB, that's my crew, told my mama, "I got you"
Funny how I'm hittin' hoes that ain't want me in high school
'Cause I'm rollin' now, yeah they know I'm rollin' now
And my money, can't fold it now, I done came up

[Chorus]
Remember back then all them hoes ain't want me
Now I'm ballin', all them same hoes on me
Mama told me that this came with the money
And the mothafuckin' fame, even though I feel the same
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
Yeah I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now

[Verse 2]
Yeah I've been ballin' with my bros, I've been fuckin' all these hoes
I've been switchin' up my cars like I'm switchin' up my clothes
Smokin' all this dope, got your bitch faded
Damn it feels good to finally say I made it
Cashin' all these checks, put new diamonds all in my neck
Bought a chain for my daughter just to show her how to flex
Got now, fuck next, every day I'm ballin'
Just changed my number, label still callin'
Feelin' like Mike Jones 'cause back then they ain't want me
But now I'm on and all them hoes, they all on me
'Cause they know I'm rollin' now, and it is beginnin' now
Y'all hoes like different now, I done came up

[Chorus]
Remember back then all them hoes ain't want me
Now I'm ballin', all them same hoes on me
Mama told me that this came with the money
And the mothafuckin' fame, even though I feel the same
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
Yeah I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now

 [Intro: PnB Rock]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
Put some diamonds round my neck, now my shit frozen
I could sing to your bitch and she be open
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Drinkin' this lean by the seal
Fuckin' this bitch off a pill
I'm lovin' the way that she feels
I signed my own self to a deal
New lane, this shit's so unreal
They hatin' but they better chill
This .40, it can't be concealed
Nobody gave me a loan
I did it all on my own
Remember I ain't have a home
Now bitch I got me two homes
I did it all by myself
Bitch don't be countin' my wealth
No cosigns, no help

I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
Put some diamonds round my neck, now my shit frozen
I could sing to your bitch and she be open
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Say this for my sisters, my brothers
Y'all niggas straight out the gutter
Remember we didn't have nothin'
And now I can buy everything that I wanted
Bibby, I'm not with the stuntin'
These bitches know that I got it
I just might walk in the store
See it, I like it, you know that I cop it
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real
All of that hatin', it might get you killed
Pardon my brother, he ain't got no chill
He been that way ever since we was little
Straight from the block, I'm with PnB Rock
We was lettin' off shots, we was runnin' from cops
Out in the field we was lookin' for ops
Now we at the dealership lookin' for drops
Niggas don't know how it feel
I slept with rats in the crib
Now I got three different homes
I don't know where I'ma live
I'm tryna cop me that Wraith
They don't want no beef cause it's too much at stake
Niggas be broke, that's the reason they hate
Flippin' them burgers for minimum wage, aye

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
Put some diamonds round my neck, now my shit frozen

Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real

 [Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Verse 1: Hollowman]
Stay down ‘til I come up
Always tryna stay one up
Mini K hold fifty in it
Case a nigga wanna run up
Sundown to the sun up
I don’t ever put my gun up
I don’t ever put my gun down
Only when I pick my son up
Turn it up for my whole team
I’m a [?] ass rapper
No time for a fuck nigga
No time for a heifer, oh
Now you niggas wanna claim hoes
Man, then you shoulda kept her
I’ma fuck her with her clothes on
I’ma hit her on the dresser
They go left with it, I go right with it
Nigga never been a stepper
These hoes seasonal
They bring salt to the game, nigga I’ma bring pepper
Stay down ‘til I get right
Long days and the quick nights
Loud pack with the thick Sprite
Bad ho that eat the dick right

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
You know I can’t fuck around, nah
And I can’t trust these bitches, they won’t be my downfall
And I can’t trust these niggas, it could be a mid dog
See you gettin’ paid but they start hating, takin’ it all
But I can’t go like that (hell nah)
Said I can’t go like that (hell nah)
Can’t play with my life, you can’t play with my family
Can’t play with my dough like that (hell nah)
‘Cause that’s when shit get real
And don’t make me have to kill ya
‘Cause I ain’t seen my daughter talk
And I ain’t made a mil yet
Out of town, stayin’ down, selling work
Watching, [?] for the cops, my enemies and shirt
Gotta watch my body ‘cause I’m doing dirt
And I’m so paranoid, run up and you’ll get murked

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Verse 3: RockStar]
Stuck in that trap
Forty on my lap
First one to squeeze
Niggas screamin’ Lord please
Young and reckless nigga
Never gave a fuck
Always chasing that dream
But I seem to always get stuck
Woke up one day
Said I’ma go and get it my way
Fuck a team and use yaself
Nobody cares about my wealth
Now I’m getting money
Far from looking bummy
Bitches wanna eat shrimp and steak
And rub all on my tummy
Watch my movies on TV
Tell me that they love me
But I don’t trust these hoes
All I love is this money
Still stay on go
Never break or fold
Live by that street code
Until the day I blow
I’ma

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah
Stay down ‘til I come up
‘Cause it’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
We ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

[Outro]
‘Til I come up
It’s all about the come up
And we about to come up
Fuckin’ around, we ain’t fuckin’ around, nah

Still remember my first lick when I really got paid
Won't forget it like that girl who got away
She looking back right now like damn what could have been
Seen me winning now she thinking what could have been

 [Verse 1]
Fuck these hoes, I just hit ‘em then I flee ‘em
‘Cause I know hoes fuckin’ for some lime-a-ritas
Think I’m cuffing, you don’t know me ho
Yeah we can chill, and we can fuck, and we can smoke this dope
Other than that, you don’t get nothin’ but a lil conversation
‘Cause we cool but we ain’t that cool
Bitch I ain’t really got no patience
For no ho shit
Learned that back in oh-six
Fell in love, I went to jail
She ain’t hold me down, I was so sick
Nowadays I been in the trap, gettin’ them racks
Watch ‘cause the cops kickin’ doors down
And made money, the bitch she ain’t been on my mind
‘cause I ain’t really worried ‘bout no hoes now
Lately I been over there in mix
Stayin’ down, tryna get a brick
Stayin’ strapped with my four pound
Nigga just said he got a lick
Say he know the boy with the shit
Hell yeah I’m on go now
I’m rappin’, I’m trappin’, I’m singin’, I’m smashin’, your girl wanna have me (that’s her)
I hit my plug like I’m ready and he come at me with the package (that work)
I’m smokin’, I’m drinkin’, I’m leanin’, but don’t ever think that I’m lackin’ (hell nah)
Here go the answers to all of the questions I know you gon’ ask me (ask me)

[Chorus]
Fuck these hoes, I ain’t really on they time
You ain’t money bitch, then you ain’t on my mind
I been rappin’, I been trappin’, I been stackin’, never lackin’
Bitch I’m strapped, go ask this judge, you think I’m lyin’
Fuck these hoes, I ain’t really on they time
You ain’t money bitch, then you ain’t on my mind
I been rappin’, I been trappin’, I been stackin’, never lackin’
Bitch I’m strapped, go ask this judge, you think I’m lyin’

[Verse 2]
Niggas actin’ like they trappin’, they be fraudin’
Never sold no crack, on tracks like I got hard an’
I bet that you don’t even know a plug
Faking for these bum bitches, man we know what’s up
Niggas do anything for a buzz now
See it’s cool to act like you sell drugs now

We was smoking on kite
Just got my green shit I'm on my way home
I'm thinking like damn cause my niggas got life Nothing I can say that's gonna make it feel right
Y'all don't understand me and bro we was tight
Same Jail , Couple Years , Different Case Different Bed
Shit we use to eat chi chi every other night
He was my spacebar , every tournament
Putting Macs on on like we was born to win
Playing chess to catch a wreck we going in
Jail ways death boys and they grown men
But I'm home now & he ain't neva coming home
& every other month it's a letter coming home
Like Rock when I hear you on top
It's gone fuck they head up when they find out when I'm coming home
(Woop) mane that shit hurt my heart
Cause I know he forreal
Waiting on that appeal
He was only 18 they gave my nigga will
He ain't gone get to live to see a green sheet
He ain't gone make it back out to the streets
But the crazy part about it , he ain't gonna get to hear this CD
Shit fucked up nigga
System real fucked up niggaa
On some real shit I
If I rule the world you know you would be out here monster nigga
Fucking these hoes & rocking these shows
Getting this money you already know
Driving these foreigns& smoking this dope
Free my nigga I wish he can come home damn
(YOU SAID DONT FORGET ABOUT U) (x2)
(But how we gone forget about you )
( when you was one of the realest niggas)
(All the time we miss you nigga )
(It's fucked up the life they gave to you nigga)

Free my niggas
Free the whole upstate




 [Chorus]
My homie booked
He said he going through some things right now
I tried to tell him hold his head, don't let em bring you down
They used to love him in the streets
But they don't know him now
Plus his baby ma, she trippin', she don't hold him down
She don't send no bread, it's fucking with his head
And he just got a letter, said his lil brother dead
And every other week he getting visits from the feds
The stress is building up, sometimes he wishing he was dead

[Verse 1]
State correction institution, I just left a visit
Seen my nigga, he stressed out, so I just sat and listened
Been only down a couple years
He said the streets don't miss him
And he was just the man out there, he said he don't get it
Outta sight, outta mind
That's just it, bottom line
You see who fuck with you
And who love you when you doing time
Said his homie snitched and signed
His name up on that dotted line
Told them people everything
Shed no tears and dropped the dime
Plus he just found out his lil bro got hit 11 times
Shot him in his face, all in his head right in front of they mom
All this shit is going down, he in a cell losing his mind
Ain't even wanna mention all the shit about his baby moms
She don't send no bread, It's fucking with his head
And just the other day she said she moving with the kids
She found a different nigga, different city with some bread
Said they moving to his crib, she left my nigga sick

[Chorus]
My homie booked
He said he going through some things right now
I tried to tell him hold his head, don't let em bring you down
They used to love him in the streets
But they don't know him now
Plus his baby ma, she trippin', she don't hold him down
She don't send no bread and it's fucking with his head
And he just got a letter, said his lil brother dead
And every other week he getting visits from the feds
The stress is building up, sometimes he wishing he was dead

[Verse 2]
I told my nigga hold his head, it's cool yeah he gon' make it
5 times a day, Salah and just keep on praying
He waiting on that appeal, I told him just be patient
Everything don't happen overnight bro, I'm just saying
My dog stressin' everyday he wake up
Cause the feds steady tryna build a case up
He was flippin' bricks and getting to that paper
But had to smoke a nigga cause he tried to take some
A nigga tried to rob his man for a couple bands
His crazy cousin man, the one who took the stand
And got my nigga life inside the fucking can
When he did that shit just for him and I don't understand

[Chorus]
My homie booked
He said he going through some things right now
I tried to tell him hold his head, don't let em bring you down
They used to love him in the streets
But they don't know him now
Plus his baby ma, she trippin', she don't hold him down
She don't send no bread and it's fucking with his head
And he just got a letter, said his lil brother dead
Just the other day he got some visits from the feds
The stress is building up, sometimes he wishing he was dead




 [Chorus]

 [Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I'm just keeping it a hunnit'
Girl, fuck a fifty
I need a bad bitch, who's loyal
And ain't too mixy for me
Need a jawn to help me count this paper
I need a real chick with no filter on and no makeup

[Pre-Hook: PnB Rock]
'Cause I done been around the world
Fucked a bunch of girls
Yeah, they talk that cuffing shit
But they all be with the shits
Yeah, I done been around the world
Fucked a bunch of girls
But now I'm in a different space
Tired of all these bitches in my face
So shawty, where you at, 'cause I'm around
I'm hanging up my jersey for you
When I find you, I'ma lock you down

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Right now, I'm riding down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down
I couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But Imma run it up regardless
And having you here is better
That's the truth, right now
I'm right down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down too
Couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But if you really need me
Shawty, please believe me
Know, that I'll always be there for you

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, I bought a 911 and a new crib
I need a bad bitch to ride passenger
When I drive that shit
And she might tell me "Dolla slow down"
But she gone take that D
She gonna take that D for Dolla

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & PnB Rock]
'Cause I done been around the world
Fucked a lot of girls
Yeah, they talk that cuffing shit
But they still be with the shits
Yeah, I done been around the world
Fucked a bunch of girls
But now I'm in a different space
Tired of all these bitches in my face
So shawty, where you at, 'cause I'm around
I'm hanging up my jersey for you
When I find you, I'ma lock you down

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
I don't really want to do nothing
Back then I ain't do cuffin'
I was really on some savage shit
Out there looking for the baddest bitch
Once I hit it, I was dashing quick
Fuck and duck, I might've mastered it
Now I'm feeling like I changed now
Need a girl to be my main now
So where you been, 'cause I'm looking for you
Got some plans and they all for you
I got bands and they all for you
Real nigga I'm just trynna spoil you
Want some sex, but I know, it's more to you
Fuck your ex, I could do more for you girl
I'm so tired of chasing these hoes
Can't wait to call someone my own

[Hook: PnB Rock]
Right now, I'm riding down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down
I couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But Imma run it up regardless
And having you here is better
That's the truth, right now
I'm right down my side of town
I'm high as hell, you fly as hell
You hold me down, Imma hold you down too
Couldn't run this shit the way I really wanted
But if you really need me
Shawty, please believe me
Know, that I'll always be there for you




 [Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, ooh

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I don't wanna break your heart
Girl simply because
I'm deeply in love
With another girl
And she the one who got my heart
And part of my soul
I can't let her go
Just thought I'd let you know
'Cause I don't wanna break your heart

[Verse 1: B.Love]
I think about replacing you
You think you were irreplaceable
I'm moving on, trust me girl I'm fully capable
I'm in love, swear this feeling's not mistakable
I got this other place that I go to get away from you
Where the girl inside she often tells me not to wait for you
So much fucking hate for you, I need to get away from you
I tell you that I'll leave but you know I'll always stay with you
Yeah I'm out with her, but I'm coming home to lay with you
I can't let you go, girl that's something that you know
She said tell me something new, she said something that I don't
Always tell you that I'll leave, always tell me that I won't
And I hide on my emotions, that's not something I should flaunt
I'm with her, I'm with you, guess I'm split between the two
All this talk bout me and her, girl let's talk bout me and you
And I found my Cinderella, I think she could fit the shoe
Once you notice that I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' do?

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I don't wanna break your heart
Girl simply because
I'm deeply in love
With another girl
And she the one who got my heart
And part of my soul
I can't let her go
Just thought I'd let you know
'Cause I don't wanna break your heart

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I know, I know, I know, I know this sound crazy
Cause you know, you know, you know, you know you my baby
But I know, I know, I know, I know you can't change me
Plus this girl Harmony, she got control of me
She got a hold on me, got me like no don't leave
Girl you the one I want, but she's the one I need
The one I need
She gon' get me to the money
She gon' keep a nigga stuntin'
When I'm with her don't need nothing, no
And you probably don't wanna hear this but it's true
Them other bitches they don't compare to you
Girl when we together we do what we do
We had great sex, I mean all night
With no latex, just straight hard pipe
I laid comfortable with you all night
But me and Harmony is different
She live in my soul, she see all my visions
We go in that booth and make them childrens
Shawty you don't even get it, listen

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I don't wanna break your heart
Girl simply because
I'm deeply in love
With another girl
And she the one who got my heart
And part of my soul
I can't let her go
Just thought I'd let you know
'Cause I don't wanna break your heart




 [Intro]
Yeah
Got my heart racin'
Can't wait till we all make it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I'm just grindin' with my gang until we all make it

Yeah, till we all make it
I swear I can't wait until we all make it
Drivin' in that foreign got my heart racin'
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'

[Verse 1]
Man I swear this right here might be my theme song
I don't leave the house if I don't got my chains on
Sorry, baby, I can't cuff you, bitch, I ain't gone
I just wanna smoke dope and get my lean on
Get my dream on, put my whole team on
Cut some snakes off that tried to get their scheme on
Fuck it though that's life, I just bought some new ice
I just crashed a new foreign, only drove the bitch twice
I used to eat gravy and rice, now I can eat steak every night
I can take a nigga wife, I fuck her, she won't stay the night
Remember bitches tried to play me
Now them same hoes chase me
Man this lifestyle crazy
But I will never get lazy

[Hook]
I'm just grindin' with my gang until we all make it
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'
I can't fuck with niggas, they be all hatin'

Ohhh, I be heart breakin'
I can't fuck wit bitches, they be all chasin'
Drivin' in this foreign got my heart racin'
I swear I can't wait until we all make it

[Verse 2]
I swear I can't wait till we all make it
Whole team passports goin' them far places
Houses with all of them acres, rollie's with all them big faces
Ain't no more catchin' new cases, smiles on all of our faces
Man, it's crazy how we came up from nothin'
We was just on the block fuckin' hustlin'
Sellin' them rocks and duckin' them cops, fuckin' that work  all up in the pot
Beefin' with nigga's from right down the block
Pullin' all nighters and X'n out ops
Now it's all these bad bitches at my hotel
Remember my phone only used to ring for coke sales
Now I'm on tour doin' shows now
Heart racin' chasing paper on the road now

[Hook]
I'm just grindin' with my gang until we all make it
Chasin' all this money got my heart racin'
I can't fuck with niggas, they be all hatin'
It's funny how these bitches think we all datin'
Ohhh, I be heart breakin'
I can't fuck with bitches they be all chasin'
Drivin' in this foreign got my heart racin'
I swear I can't wait until we all make it

Ooh, ooh

Talk that work shit, with Dave East
Fuck these niggas talkin' about?
Whoo

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Standin' in the kitchen, I done fucked up a couple grams

Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Leash and T came up on some work and they brought it to my attention
Like, "Rock, do you know how to cook it?"
I said, "Fuck no, but let's go to the kitchen." (ooh)
We went to the kitchen and I got to whippin' and whippin' and whippin' 'til it disappeared
I was like, "Oh!", T was like, "Bro!", and Leash was like, "Damn! What the fuck you done did?"
I don't know but let me call my plug (Brrr, Brrr)
He came and remixed the work
He bought that shit back, I made a power pack and I took it [?]
Trap phone jumping like Jordan
Let me tell you 'bout my young nigga Joy
He be OT, movin' work low key, always call me like, "Fuck, I need more shit."
Trap phone jumpin' like D. Rose
[?] keep callin' me the hero
Niggas keep talkin' that work shit
Get booked, start singin' like mingo
I whip it so good, my wrist got the cramps
I will take change, I even take stamps
I'm whippin' and whippin' and breakin' it down
Whippin' and whippin' and breakin' it down

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Standin' in the kitchen, I done fucked up a couple grams
Tell my OG remix it, now I'm making bands

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Nigga I can show you how to whip it
My cousin Booster went and showed me about this crippin'
I'm sippin' juice, it got a nigga feelin' different (lean)
Little B up in the kitchen water whippin'
My nigga Rock said he came up on the block
36 oz, we can put it in a pot
When that money come in, that's when niggas start to plot
Standin' in the kitchen with a smoker and a Glock
Runnin' out of baking soda, hit it with the ice
Whip it with a knife, zombies outside all night
Slept in the trap, wake up first I check my phone
You could make a livin' off white
Blanco, but the color off-white
[?] was the best
Powder all over the livin' room
Call Keyshia, come clean up this mess
I done seen it happen to the best
I was never blind to it, no Ray Charles
[?]
I know your pops, he just called us for an 8 bar
Put it on my tongue, I can taste raw (mmm)
For the love of a brick, I ain't lovin' no chick
Here's some coke, sniff your face off

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Standin' in the kitchen, I done fucked up a couple grams
Tell my OG remix it, now I'm making bands
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)

Nigga I can show you how to whip it (ooh)
Nigga let me show you how to whip it (ooh)




 [Chorus: PnB Rock]
Got to get my head right, got to get my bread right
Just to get my family out these streets
Ain't worryin' 'bout no hoes, I ain't fuckin' with my bros
'Cause right now I'm like the only one for me, for me, for me
Everybody all for they self
But fuck it, I don't need no help
I got me

[Verse 1: PnB Chizz]
I got me, can't no bitch say that
I ain't on nobody roster, they can't bench me scraps
'Cause I'm a free agent, no there ain't no salary cap
I trap the graveyard shift, I stay where vamps lay at
All these lost souls fishin' to listen to that new soul tape
If you apply pressure I promise you that I won't break
I seen it at sixteen, told 'em that they was gon' hate
I was preachin' the future yet wondering what it's gon' take
But I get it, I get it, I finally see it y'all
They don't have dreams so how they supposed to believe in ours
I kept on changing my name 'cause I knew my soul was lost
But look I found it, ayy let me introduce you to John
We gon' make it out Rock, godspeed
It's gon' take a lil patience but it's godspeed
That's the only person I can say that I need
Ain't nobody else who got me like I got me

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Got to get my head right, got to get my bread right
Just to get my family out these streets
Ain't worryin' 'bout no hoes, I ain't fuckin' with my bros
'Cause right now I'm like the only one for me, for me, for me
Everybody all for they self
But fuck it, I don't need no help
I got me

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
It took a while for me just to get it
Like what my songs ain't good enough? what they ain't fuckin' wit' it?
I'm just asking for support, what that's too much for niggas?
That loyalty word ain't no joke, that shit'll have you trippin'
Like can you be loyal to niggas that done changed on you?
And do for niggas that won't even do the same for you?
You outside while they chilling in the house
Watching TV on the couch, like fuck it, lettin' it rain on you
Don't understand niggas, I don't understand
Spend money on a bitch but you won't spend it on your man, I know
Yeah I get it my nigga, you got a job
I just find it crazy, smokers pay for my studio time
Yet you always in my sessions screaming, "Rock, turn up"
You just waiting for a check as soon as Rock blow up
I wrote this song so you could never say I never told you
We're finished turning up, I'm turning over

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Got to get my head right, got to get my bread right
Just to get my family out these streets
Ain't worryin' 'bout no hoes, I ain't fuckin' with my bros
'Cause right now I'm like the only one for me, for me, for me
Everybody all for they self
But fuck it, I don't need no help
I got me




 Oh yeah
Oo oo
Real shit

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong and baby girl I can't change that
But I wrote this song cause girl  I don't want your heart
To way remain that, that way I left it girl
I know your heart was torn
And I don't want you to feel like you were all alone
Girl  it wasn't you but instead it was me
And everything will be alright even though it's hard to see
Baby girl don't stress the fact that you ain't got a man
I'm sorry that I hurt you baby you don't understand

[Chorus]
Listen I know I did you wrong
And baby ain't no changing that
But girl our love is strong
So maybe we can take it back to, to that one point in time
Girl  when you were mine
And I was always on your mind (x2) yeah

[Verse 2]
Now listen shawty I know how you feeling
But I just had my own little problems I had to deal with
Like all them other ladies that I was sneaking round with
Telling me that they should be my one and only down chick
But I just couldn't see at the time that you was hurting
And I just hope this song that I'm singing to you is working
Cause, I just can't breathe without you
Girl I can't eat without you
(boy) I can't sleep without you
Baby I can't be me without you

[Chorus]
Listen I know I did you wrong
And baby ain't no changing that
But girl our love is strong
So maybe we can take it back to, to that one point in time
Girl when you were mine
And I was always on your mind (x2) yeah

[Outro]
I ain't fell in love since you
It wasn't real if it wasn't you
I swear different bitches they can't fuck with you
The way you left me girl, what was a thug to do




 [Intro: PnB Rock]
Ooh, ooh
Come through
Rock

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Grab my phone, call my bitch
She come through, she roll up, then I hit
We pass out, wake up, then we do it again
Dick so good she said she need to bring her friend
That’s my bitch, yeah that’s my bitch
Fuck me good, suck me good, and she count them benjamins
She got on all that designer, baby girl she the shit
She just gave me twenty pounds, she said she just hit a lick
Yeah, that’s my ride or die
She say if you get booked I’ll be by your side
She say she gon’ hold me down, in the streets she hold me down
Everything is in her name, she never trip when I stay down
You a hundred, I’m a hundred, you already know
You ain’t my girl, I ain’t your nigga, you know we just folks
We on the low ‘cause we both know it’s best if they don’t know
You can’t relax after the sex ‘cause baby I’ma roll

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl

[Verse 2: Shotty]
Roll that dope, let it burn
That’s your bitch, but she with me so it’s my turn
You keep calling, she ain’t answer, you ain’t learn?
I just fuck and give her back like a return
Yeah she love me, yeah she say she love me
But she probably want my money, that bitch can’t get nothin’ from me
We can smoke, we can fuck, we can pop a couple perks
I can turn my camera on and just sit back and watch you work
Different shit, yeah she never quit
She be all up on my dick like shawty you be on some shit
When she call and I don’t answer she know I be in the mix
But I bust back like where you at
Come through we gon’ smoke some piff
We get high, we get faded
She fuckin’ me like I made it
No Usher, we trading places
I’m biting, don’t gotta shake it
She out of breath, started pacing
Killing her, call me Jason
She tell me that I’m the best
With me there’s no replacement

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
I’ma roll, I’ma roll
We gon’ get that dope and roll it up
And we gon’ smoke and we gon’ fuck
And we gon’ do it all again girl

[Hook: Pnb Rock x2]
My money so long
My weed is so strong
These hoes call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Money so long, can't fall
Everyday I buy new clothes
Everyday I smoke two O's
I been in my zone

[Verse 1: Pnb Rock]
Dumping wood, sipping lean
Thirteen-hunnit' Balmains
I been living like a savage
Pussy stains on my jeans
I'm that nigga on the low
You ain't know? Now you know
Twenty bands, one show
I did that shit on my own
I been really in my zone lately, I been really in my zone lately
These bitches keep calling my phone
I gave her the dick now she going crazy
Ever since that I got on, everybody wanna know how I'm doing lately
Where the fuck was they when I was going crazy?
I was broke, I ain't have me no home, baby
Now everyday I buy new clothes and everyday I smoke two O's
And after every one of my shows, I fuck like one or two hoes
I just might go cop a fern, I just might go buy me a hoe
I winning, I'm feeling like Diddy now
Might fuck around and buy me a boat

[Hook: Pnb Rock x2]
My money so long
My weed is so strong
These hoes call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Money so long, can't fall
Everyday I buy new clothes
Everyday I smoke two O's
I been in my zone

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
My money too long can't fall nigga
Try running from the plug, you got the wrong nigga
I been riding round' the city with a chopper
And some lean, I don't serve by the knot
He don't know I'ma bout' to buy her a Birkin bag
In the kitchen, with the pigeons
Give the birds a bath
That pussy too good, I'ma dab it
I'ma swerve, straight to curb in a new Bentley
I was broke back then had to run it up
Still trapping out the bando, no furniture
I'm about to get some money and I feel it
Young rich nigga living like Diddy

[Hook: Pnb Rock x2]
My money so long
My weed is so strong
These hoes call my phone
They won't leave me alone
Money so long, can't fall
Everyday I buy new clothes
Everyday I smoke two O's
I been in my zone




 Aw yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Time to separate myself from all these clown niggas
You ain't in my circle than you can't be around niggas
You get no handshake you get a pound nigga
That's even if you get close enough to be around niggas
Cus we don't like new faces unless they blue faces
And we don't do new niggas
Cus low key they be hating
And we don't trust these bitches
Cus low key they be snaking
To be catching all these flights ain't no more catching cases
I remember trapping at it wearing the same clothes
Couldn't drip cus I kept fucking up my bankroll
I remember I was homeless had like eight hoes
Couldn't fuck cus I ain't have nowhere to take off
Could you imagine that
Abandon cribs my habitat
Hit a lick then got locked up
Lost it all and got it back
Man I swear I couldn't make this up
This my life and it's hard for me to recreate this stuff
(Man this shit be crazy cus sometimes I be sitting back and I be thinking like damn I really came from the fucking mud like young nigga done came up)
Did this shit all with my brodies
I won't switch up on my brodies
Lately shit been going done
Don't approach me lIke you know me
Niggas tryna take me out
So I keep about thirty on me
I won't let em take me out
Cus they bite they banking on me
They took my shit ain't really shit you can do to me
They took my bro now my future ain't what it used to be
We was suppose to do it all
New ice new cars
Now I'm looking to the stars
Damn we took a major lost
Now I Gotta go harder
Now I gotta be smarter
Kill a nigga for I leave my daughter
It's up to me to keep this shit in order
(Ha ha like I'll never go back to jail again you feel me I maxed out my daughter will never have to go through what I went through )
Aw yeah
And I know the streets will miss me a little I was gone but I'm back again
Thankful I ain't never gotta trap again
I won't never have to put my hands behind my back again
All my days in jail are over I ain't going back again
Whole time I was poppin I was on the run
Now I'm free I feel like my life has just begun
Hell yeah hell yeah I done maxed out
All my real niggas yeah they know what that's bout
Taking over time for me to do this shit
Mont told me no more room for the stupid shit
Feels good to be no longer a fugitive
Fuck that let's get back to this music shit
I been only going hard for about a year
But ask about in ya city bet I'm popping there
My folks still in the hood I'm tryna get em out of there
Got niggas in the jail can't wait till they get outa there
Cash rules everything dollar dollar bill
And every not I have another dream about a mil
I had fans in London way before I had a deal
Cus im the hottest youngin in my city that's for real
Name ya favorite rapper bet he ask me for a hook
All my shit do numbers Yal could put me in the books
Crazy last summer all a nigga knew was jugg
Now this year rock done hopped up in that Porsche
Yeah yeah




 [Verse]
I grew up without my dad
Cause he got killed by my brother's mom
Word on the street is that she stabbed him a couple times
Found out that he had another girl pregnant
Tryna let it go but but her pop wouldn't let it
Thots saying murder so she picked up a weapon
Knife to the chest, now there's no more Fredrick, damn
Was too young to even be sad though
Everything was all cool cause I had more
He was more than an uncle, he was more like a brother
Matter of fact he was more like my dad though
Took part of my soul when they killed him
Seven twelve oh-seven shit got real
One shot to the chest can't be real
To this day man y'all don't know how I feel
Still wanna call your phone
But I know that you won't answer, I feel all alone
Streets raised me, mom did what she could
Tryna raise five bad boys in the hood
By the age of thirteen nigga I was smoking weed
Got my hands on a gun same day I caught a jug
Kicked out the crib mom's tired of the cops knocking
Dropped out of high school, said fuck college
Just a young nigga out here with no guidance
Skinny nigga that was never scared of nobody
I caught a juvenile case, yeah they sat me down
Couple months in Arizona now I'm back around
Fuck no, no lessons learned
I came home thinkin' it's my turn
On probation still catching cases
Still smoking weed, now I'm on the run
While later, man I ran into some money
Lord knows couldn't tell me nothin'
I'm for real when they copped [?]
[?] jewelry me and mean, we was stuntin'
But you know that ain't last long
Like i said I was on the run
Nigga caught another case and they sent me upstate
Hard time, wasn't nothin' fun
Whole time I was up there snappin'
No friends, no fam, what happened
No mail, no texts got a nigga catchin' wreck in the mountains
I was up there stressin'
Writin' songs made time go by
'Till my celly said rock you hot
I'm for real, you can probably get a deal
Matter fact let's take it to the yard outside
I spit a verse and sung a hook and they said bring it back
Young boy, you got that work, you really in your bag
Came home and I'm fucking up the game now
Niggas mad cause I rap and sing now
Hell yeah I done made my own lane now
Watch this R&B shit be flames now
Watch this R&B shit be flames now




 [Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Wooh
RnB, wooh

[Chorus]
Really this is all of me
Nigga this is RnB
I do this shit for the streets
'Cause without them there is no me

[Verse 1]
I ain't nothing like these rappers
I'm a motherfuckin' trapper
I be really O-T
Selling crack to them crackers
And them old niggas too
They love when I come through
I sell 1, it go for 2
Ask about me what i do
Nigga I be really in the mix
I done prolly fucked yo bitch
When you see me better tuck yo' shit
Pussy I'll take yo' shit
Niggas think just 'cause I sing
I won't fuckin' let it ring
Its one time for PnB, it's the motherfuckin' gang
We a bunch of young hitters
I'd ride for my nigga
I put that shit on my mom
I'd die for my niggas
Can't wait till they free my brother meen
Cuz we gone fuck up the game
Not only do he rap, he sing
And just like me he let it bang, bang, bang bang
2015 he max out dam nigga thats 5 years
When that fuckin day come
Ima fuck around and cry tears
Fucking right i miss my nigga
Everday i was with my nigga
Jail split apart when we link back up
We gone be rich my nigga
Till then I'm getting trap money
Just learnin how to stack money
Anybody that want me on a track
Tell em bring some racks for me
You don't got it then don't ask for me
Time is money hell yeah that's true time is money hell yea that's true
Nigga this that RnB2

Oh yeah

Time is money hell yea that's true
Nigga this that RnB2

[verse two]

Lately I been winning tho
I been hitting different hoes
I ain't really gotta pay for shit
Cuz now designers give me clothes
I got rappers sick of me
Cuz the way im switching flows
All for a hook i go to Neimans like give me that give me those
Shot out to my momma tho
She just got through surgery
I know shit is fucked up
Lately she ain't heard from me
She don't understand
I'm trynna put her where she pose to be
Get us all out the hood
For she have to bury me
Shit is gettin real-er now
My daughter gettin bigger now
Most the time I'm on the road
I'm wishing i was wit her now
Thinking about my old bitch
I know that bitch see me now
But all of these new bitches helpin me forget her now
Man i swear i can't wait till we get rich
Till all of my niggas pull up in some shit
And all of my folks got money in different bank accounts
For them and all of their kids
(wooooh)
I cannot lie in the booth
(wooooh)
I swear I'm telling the truth
(wooooh)
This my story to you

This is that RnB 2

Some from Texas, some from Cali, some do not live in the states
I'm ashamed, no I'm not
Who am I kidding, man I love it
24 with like 24 reasons to say "Fuck it"
It's so easy now
Women multiplying off my clout
To tell the truth, though, I had hoes when I was sleepin' on the couch
That's the sauce, that's the sauce
Always had it, always will
To the ones who got my real number, let me keep it real
Pour out my exes, I pour up some new ones
Please do not take pictures, you doing too much
Fuck talking, I keep it short like a crew cut
I can't fuck you if you let the whole crew fuck
It's been too long, I've been fucking you since I was tryin' to get on
And now you got a husband, now you got kids
They don't gotta know, fuck thinkin' 'bout this, yeah

I left 'em hanging just for reaching
Picture going hard for somebody then they end up leaving
That mean you did it for no reason
Baby I'ma cuff you if I want to, fuck a season

If I touch you there I bet you won't stop leakin'

She say, "Roy, why you always rollin' the backwoods up?" (why)
Why do I do things? Understand that I'm a different kind (understand me)
You wanna stunt, I'll get you anything that you need
Girl, you a boss, they don't know 'bout the place that you came from (came from)
Do's this all night and day like Adrian Peterson
I changed you, 'cause I dun know you not no greedy girl
Don't pop bands, but I pop Xans

Go grind for yourself, get your own bands
Done fightin' like, "Why you again? Why you again?"

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in my car right now
Smokin' on this killer weed
Damn this shit is killin' me
Thinkin' bout these memories
Just thinkin' bout the times we shared
And all the shit you did for me
Nobody could fill your shoes
World stopped when I lost you
I'm stressin'
These tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
I would always wear your clothes after school
I was tryna be cool
I was tryna be just like you
I got all these tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
Me and you used to ride around town with the music up loud
I swear you was that nigga in town

[Chorus:]
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared

Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause

[Verse 2]
It ain't no question, you was such a blessing
Tried to keep me off the street shit
Keep me out the precinct
You was my protection
Sometimes I feel like I took you for granted
And nobody would ever understand it
You told me to keep up with the music
I know you would proud at where I landed
These tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
When my mom used to call you up
Any time I was cuttin' up
You would fuck me up
I got all these tears rollin' down my face
I'm thinkin' bout those days
I would always sneak in your room
Just to play with your guns
Paranoid 'cause if you caught me, I was done

[Chorus]
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause

[Verse 3]
You taught me so many lessons
But I know all dogs go to heaven
You died way before your time
You had me rockin' Trueys in '07
You had me rockin' purple label shit
I had bout every pair of Jay's again
You was the glue that kept the fam together
When you died we went our separate ways instead
I got these tears rollin' down my face
'Cause I'm thinkin' bout those days
You would always buy a new cell phone
I would ask you for your old cell phone
I was tryna be grown
I got all these tears rollin' down my face
'Cause I'm thinkin' bout those days
You would come through and teach me how to stunt
You would buy a nigga anything I want
I mean anything I want

[Chorus]
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause I'm missin' you
I'm missin' you
Oh yeah
Sittin' wishin' you was here
Thinkin' bout the times that we shared
I'm stressin' cause
I'm missin' you




 [Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Tryna figure out what you tweaking for
Everything was all good just a week ago
Now you tryna act like I'm creeping though
Told you I had hoes, but you must ain't believed me though
Questions, like why I don't answer my phone
Shawty, you tripping, I'm busy, you always wanna fuck up my zone
Texting me paragraphs and textbooks, girl just leave me alone
You ain't my mom or my PO, ain't got to answer you, I'm grown

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know

And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 2]
I been touching hoes the same way that I touch you
Fucking hoes the same way that I fuck you
Treating hoes the same way, but I trust you
I don't love you, but I love you
Do you get it? Do you get it?
This here's something different
What we share is something different
I don't care girl, I'm different
I ain't like these other niggas
I don't care if you was strippin'
Throw it back girl, I'm tippin'
I can't lie girl, I miss it

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Hook]
'Cause I told you what it was, I let you know

 [Intro]
Oh yeah
Gotta turn up one time
Turn the mic up some
Oh yeah

[Verse]
I got a main chick but I fuck around
'Cus it just ain't the time to be cuffing now
All these bitches temptations, I just knock em down
Soon as they start stalking I just block em now
Just a couple months turned my life crazy
Everybody know my name, I don't gotta say it
Funny how back then, man they tried to play me
Same hoes wanna fuck, Tryna have my babies
HaHa I'm laughing 'cus you think I'm dumb or something
Like i got amnesia, I don't remember them or something
2015 this my fucking summer
Man I'm feeling just like baby, Number 1 Stunna
PnB Rock, go download my app
It's free but if you want me on your shit I need a rack
If you catch me in your hood, best believe I'm strapped
I know I got all these haters I can't go like that
One of my songs your bitch favorite song
Niggas mad 'cus I'm on and my paper long
I ain't got no cosign I did it on my own
Tryna diss, I"m dropping shit man this ain't what you want
Rolling up dope, Smoke an once baby
That's why every time you see me, I look like I'm Asian
I Smoke more than Bob Marley, I think I'm Jamaican
Even if the cops coming, man I'm still blazing
Riding in that foreign, it go skrt skrt
I was just in the kitchen whipping work work
Before I buy a chick a chain or a fucking purse
I got a daughter named Milan and she comes first
Money on mind even in my dreams
I got all these bands busting out my jean
I got shooters that's gon' scoot, I dare you try to scheme
Never lacking, yeah they strapped with forties with them beams
Going in for a while, let me slow it down
Got the whole world listening to my sound
Yeah they talking shit when I ain't around
But when I pop up they don't make a sound
Shout out to the gang, Yeah we on now
No more second guessing, It's for sure now
No more second guessing, It's for sure now
That we about to take over the world now

[Hook]
I don't need friends i just need some loyal niggas
I don't need friends I just need some loyal bitches
No, I don't need friends i just need some loyal niggas
I don't need friends, man I told you
All I need is some loyalty
And I don't no fucking enemies
Your friend can turn into your fr-enemy
And I won't let that be the end of me

[Verse 2]
Gone for a while but I'm back now
The streets been waiting for this crack now
In the cell getting mail like,"Where you at now"
I'm sick and tired of hearing all these rap clowns
You got everybody signing on the track now
Niggas tryna steal your lane and that's facts now
But they can't be me, man its PnB
I done took the wave they ain't seeing me
And just last year, Ain't nobody know me
Now i walk by, everybody joe me
Man i been balling, i feel like Ginobili
I think I'm Lebron, I Think I'm Kobe
And I can take ya girl from you in 15 seconds
Sing a little Instagram clip and we sexing
I don't even gotta call, I can just text it
Tell her where I'm at and she gon' come and get naked
I'm screaming fuck the law, I hate the law
That's why every single day, I break the law
And I'm rapped out, unless its cake involved
Don't give me what I want, Ima take it all
And that's one for all them real fucking rappers
I'm not a star 'cus that's rats spelled back words
Before all this rap shit i saw a trapper
I hanged with killers, drug dealers, kidnappers

 [Verse 1]
I don't know what's going on
But I know that something's wrong
And I know that lately
My city has been crazy
It's like every day somebody gone
And every time I turn around I hear them gun sounds
Cop signs man we need to put the guns down
Everybody wanna be a shooter scared to fight
So they take a life, ain't no one on one now
All of this killing, I'm like when will it stop
And it really don't help that
Don't get no help from the cops
They hear a shooting in the hood
They get late to the block
But they hear an officer down
They get straight to the block, it's crazy
I'm tired of hearing about these missing babies
Stop the killing and let's find all of these missing babies
I wrote this song 'cause I know just how it feels
To lose somebody you love and that's real, that's why

[Hook]
I don't wanna look up, every time I look up
I can see them pictures hanging on the wall
Talking about my fam, yeah I'm talking about my dogs
Rest in peace 'em all, man I swear I miss them all
I don't wanna look up 'cause when I look up
I can see your face but I know you ain't there
Wanna call your phone but I know you won't answer
Why'd you have to go? man I swear this ain't fair
And I don't know what it is but my city need something
People killing people over nothing
I swear it's like every day I wake up
Man I hear something like
Man I miss my brother
Rest in peace my hitter
Man they took my sister
I swear we need something different but I don't know what it is

[Verse 2]
Waited all winter for this crazy summer
Who would think that they
Would take so many from us
I come from the city where they show no love
And killing innocent people man that so messed up
Good die young ain't how it's supposed to be
Every time I turn around
I lose somebody close to me
I try and hold back the tears
And be a soldier see
But memories and pain
Just seem to take a hold of me
My city need something
We need it real bad
I'm tired of yellow tape
So tired of teddy bears
I'm sick of kids growing up
Without their mom and dads
And cops killing left and right
Hey man whats up with that?
Praying for my city
Yeah it's going down
I swear in these streets
It's like a war now
You could get shot
Just from walking down the block
Little kids ain't safe
Playing on the porch now
And it's getting worse every day
I swear when your folks die
It hurts every day
And you don't even notice
When it fade away
Cuz you're so focused
On trying to take the pain away
I swear my city need a better way
And I don't think there's nothing left to say
I wrote this song
Cuz I know just how it feels
To lose somebody you love
And that's real


[Hook]
I don't wanna look up, every time I look up
I can see them pictures hanging on the wall
Talking about my fam, yeah I'm talking about my dogs
Rest in peace 'em all, man I swear I miss them all
I don't wanna look up 'cause when I look up
I can see your face but I know you ain't there
Wanna call your phone but I know you won't answer
Why'd you have to go? man I swear this ain't fair
And I don't know what it is but my city need something
People killing people over nothing
I swear it's like every day I wake up
Man I hear something like
Man I miss my brother
Rest in peace my hitter

 [Chorus]
Stressin' every day, sinnin' every day
Runnin' in and out of jail, this shit is in the way
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way
Better way, a better way
I get high all the time just to get away
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way

[Verse 2]
Gotta be a better way
Better yet a better life
In and out of jail, got my fuckin' mind stressin' life
When is you gon' grow up? when is you gon' change your ways?
When is you gon' stop smokin' pot and percs and slangin' yay
I don't know the answer so I say a long while
This the cutter, I guess I was meant to be a rider
Meant to be upstate, sittin' in the cell
Missin' my bitches, my family, my niggas in other jails
Twenty-two years old, goin' down the wrong road
Dead or in jail, they say that's where I'm finna go
But I been to jail, shit they couldn't hold me down
So I guess my next step is dead stiff up in the ground
But fuck that, 'cause no I ain't ready to go yet
I still ain't get a deal, no I still ain't blow yet
I still just had a daughter and ain't seen her grow yet
Prayin' for a better day since they ain't take my soul yet
Said I'm

[Chorus]
Stressin' every day, sinnin' every day
Runnin' in and out of jail, this shit is in the way
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way
Better way,  be a better way
I get high all the time just to get away
I know what I do is wrong so that's why I pray
Thinkin' to myself it gotta be a better way

[Outro]
Ooh, better way
To myself it gotta be a better way
Ooh, gotta be a better way

You caught my eye, and we, we caught a vibe

Ever since I met you, girl, you've always been by my side
You always there when I call, and you always on time
Fuck with you girl cause know you ain't basic
Not to mention the sex is amazing
When I met you, I thought you was Asian

In this world where nothing seem to faze me
Girl you always just seem to amaze me
All these bitches they can't have my heart
It's already taken

Every time me and Slade get together, like, shit just be crazy

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's crazy how the times change
'Cause lately I've been in a different mind frame
And lately I've been thinkin' 'bout the bigger picture
Thinkin' 'bout my brother, man, I miss that nigga
When he got killed that night I wish that I was with that nigga
Swear, I wish heaven was like jail when I could visit niggas
Speakin' of visits, I'm screaming "free Shotty"
Can't even lie, I need the go see Shotty
Lately I've been trippin', I've been actin' different
I've been fake busy, I've been fuckin' all these bitches
Sometimes I get caught up in the fame
But my loyalty to you will never change, bro, don't get it twisted
My mama and my baby mama say that I been distant
But really I just been takin' care of business
Think about this shit in a couple months
Leave it up to me and we all gon' be livin' different
I'm talkin' big houses, big cars, and big business
I'm tryna put my niggas in the good position
I'm tryna pay Milan whole school tuition
So she ain't gotta worry 'bout these fuck niggas
I'm teachin' her right now not to trust niggas
Anything that she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg, that's all me
Just know if you cross her then you cross me

[Chorus]
Pressure, this for all my niggas that done left for us
Everybody tellin' me I'm next up
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure
Goin' through this pressure
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure

[Verse 2]
The other day I had my first show in Cali
The same day they told me that they killed Saddi
I still had to go out and perform and act like it wasn't nothing going on to please everybody
And that shit hurt my heart I swear I shed so many tears
I lost so many friends, I suffered through the years
I feel like Pac, I got all eyes on me
And they be out here tellin' all these lies on me
And niggas out here saying they gon' slide on me
Like they ain't know I had the flame
Like they ain't know about the gang, until I put on a chain
Bust down, new lane
Niggas saying nothing changed, like we supposed to be the same
I can't trust these niggas, I done learned my lesson
All these diamonds on me, they came from the pressure
I can't lie, I've been living reckless
All these blogs man they got a nigga stressing
All these hoes man they out here being extra
Niggas out here asking for my extras
They be hating 'cause I'm flexing in my section
I can't lie, all this shit a blessing
They wouldn't be hating if I was out here doing nothing
Everything I got is from the muscle
If you don't fuck with me then nigga, then it's fuck you
I'm just out here fighting through this...

[Chorus]
Pressure, this for all my niggas that done left for us
Everybody tellin' me I'm next up
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure
Goin' through this pressure
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure

Thinking about what I'm finna say now

And don't be texting asking questions about no hoe shit

Said you seen my car and we drove right passed you
You said I ain't getting nothing pass you

It was something about your eyes when I met you
Yeah I swear I caught a vibe when I met you
Yeah I swear I fell in love when I text you
Cause they way you fucking talk was intellectual
Member all the times I came to your rescue
Had to wipe your fucking eyes cause they recked you
Used to hit it from the side when I sexed you
God I gotta thank your mom cause she blessed you
Yeah you used to hit my line get faded
I remember all the times we'd get wasted
Girl I used to drop you off on the west side
Used to hit it from the back that’s your best side

[Chorus]
I can’t trust or think now
All that’s on my brain now
I can’t find real love now
Some feel like a drug
You know I thought about you last night

And you know it, yeah you know it, yeah you know it

[Verse 2]

Used to say I want your time
What could have been?

[Post-Chorus]
Haven't seen her in a long time
Have you seen her?
Can we press rewind?
In a long time haven't seen her

Every time I was in LA, I was with my lil' side bitch
Every time you would call me trippin', I was like "Girl, stop it"
I was doing the most, I was out there fuckin' them hoes
I was out there smoking dope, mobbing with my bros

Woke up to you, hit that dirty
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' murk me
These niggas know they can't hurt me
'Cause I ride around wit' it
You know I keep a stick (huh)
I ain't got time for this
Put that on my mom and shit (huh)
Niggas gon' hate, that's regardless
See a lil' young nigga ballin'
I've been runnin' 'round in a foreign (swish)
Fuck a lil' bitch, she was boring
I ride around wit' it, you know I keep a stick (yeah)
These niggas broke and shit (yeah)
Ain't got no hoes or shit (yeah)
I ride around wit' my stick
Chop up that shit and go bleh, bleh
You don't want woe wit' the clique (gang)
Play with the gang, you get hit (gang)
'Cause I ride around wit' it

Don't play around and shit

[Chorus: PnB Rock]

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby, I ride around wit' my glizzy
These niggas know me, they be all in my business
They always hatin, they ain't seein' my vision
Designer on me, when I step out I'm drippin(drip)
I ride around wit' it
Back pack, hold a cool quarter million
I'm doin' better, now they all in their feelings
Cut 'em off, I don't want no more dealin's
MG when I'm ceilin', Aderall got me trippin'
Bad bitch wit' no children
See what I do and then try ride my wave
They weant my treasure, repeat what I say
All this money goin' wit' me to the grave
Balenciaga, I don't want the new J's
Found a plug and then I started gettin' paid
Jumped in the game, took over the game
You better not mention my name
That shit won't get you no fame
Tellin' lies nigga, hate they be lyin'
Catchin' bodies, put your pick in a frame
I got all mad about my bitch in a Range
I'm bouta read to you, it's not in my veins

Screamin' now that they won't be
Got some young niggas who can't wait to eat

 [Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me

[Verse 1: PnB Chizz]
Yo work man, I’m so fuckin’ high
Feel like my body’s out my mind
How he your rider, he don’t ride
Fuck nigga me wrong without a [?]
With a brand-new watch, I ain’t even got time
Got a brand-new fire, I can’t even change your mind
You see all these haters on me
I done came through and took all they shine
While they was rappin’ I was trappin’, making trips
Reason why I wasn’t ever at they networking events
Every time we drop a track we gain some fans, I am convinced
Niggas feel it ‘cause it’s realer, nigga I think we’re the shit, we the shit
I’m the realest spitter here, fuck you niggas talkin’
I pull up in that Range like fuck you niggas walkin’
And I won’t ever stop until they put me in a coffin
Coppers coming then they chalk it
Where was I again? I lost it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me

Haters all around me
All this money on me

[Verse 2: PnB Shizz]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, all eyes on me
Hit ‘em up, 2Pac with a four-four
Block jumpin’ like a pogo
Drinkin’ liquor ‘til I’m faded, tell the bartender pour more
Rollin’ weed like tides, won’t give it a break
Cut the work ‘til it rise like I’m baking a cake
But I’m bakin’ an eighth
Cook it ‘til it oils, shit so good got the fiends scrapping the plate
Tryna grind a whole chicken from a half a biscuit
No Popeyes, work lookin’ like I’m missin’ a Bisquick
So fly, thirty thousand feet with an L lit
Louboutin, blood on feet, bitch got Chanel drip
Bankrolls on fold on me
Bad bitches on poles on me
Cîroc caseloads on me
Straight shots to the body, no vest on me
Benny bops, all hundreds, need the cream
Two bitches gettin’ nasty, one thing
No fee nigga, everything free
Promethazine got a nigga on lean

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me

[Verse 3: PnB Rock]
I got them waitin’ on my shit to drop like a fuckin’ celebrity
Niggas can’t fuck with me
That’s your girlfriend, she in love with me
And she love the way that I sing to her
I’ma take her home, do my thing to her
Always talkin’ ‘bout what you ain’t doin’
She said I beat it up, you don’t do a thing to her
Smoking on piff right now
Higher than a bitch right now
I can hit a lick right now
‘Cause I don’t give a shit right now
All my niggas do the same
All my niggas ‘bout money, we ain’t playin’ no games
All my niggas go hard
Straight to the top, where we goin’ we gon’ fuck up the game
All my niggas get money like me
Smoke, pop percs, and be stunting like me
Bitch we too young, we don’t need no wifey
I say fuck your crew ayy if y’all don’t like me

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me
I’m so high
I can’t come down from these smoke clouds
Haters all around me
All this money on me
All these hundreds on me
All my niggas with me
Couple bad bitches with me

Pussy nigga don't say nothin'
You was there, don't say nothin'
Cops comin', don't say nothin'

And fuck her to my favorite song like

Without a deal, I still got a deal
I got deals on the table, that’s a lot of mils
That’s a lot of meals
Do that make you nervous? [?] pill
Why would I care about designer clothes
When I can call up Kev to design my clothes
Got better style, I’m beyond blessed
Everything fresh out on my clothes
See it all through my third eye
This the lifestyle that I live for
Can’t just be fly, I was born fly
I could drip shit from the thrift store
They like Bean what’s that line though
Trill shit, and my shirt by Milano
Teddy bear the [?], ain’t Ralph though

Hook (PNB Rock)
I’m just riding ‘round town with this new pistol

Verse 1 (Yakki Divioshi)
The hate is so real out here

See they keep this low on my wrist
My neck, they might try to kill out here
Cause niggas be merkin’ over nothin’
Claim that they robbin’ but they bluffin’
I keep that choppa with me, Waka Flocka with me
Blocka blocka with me, like oh oh
My favorite creation the stove
Cause I come from whippin’ them bowls
Sellin’ them bowls, sippin’ on flows
She wear my clothes, it’s just me and my bros
We can get it, ‘head read between the lines
Had to serve without no vision, now you blind
Niggas cross me, then I wouldn’t even be surprised
Cause I can see the envy in they eyes
Niggas hatin’ cause they tell me they gon’ ride for me
All the niggas that diss me, wanna ride for me
The loyal niggas that be whippin’ they gone ride for me
What nigga gone get locked up and do time for me

So I’m ridin’ ‘round the city strapped up by my lonely
I ain’t got no license but I still got it on me
Cops ever try to pull me over I ain’t doin’ it
We can get into a shootout early in the morning
Don’t give a fuck, nigga this the life I’m living
Came from the slumps, I was raised in the trenches
Gotta watch these hoes, even gotta watch my niggas
No, I can’t trust a soul, that’s why I got trust issues
You ain’t one hundred, just know I don’t fuck with you
You ain’t in my gang, I can’t bust a jugg with you
And it be the ones, that you thought had love for you
Be the same ones that’ll tell a judge on you

Turnin' over on you fuckboys
Fuck bitches too

[Chorus: PnB Chizz]
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies

Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
Turnin' over,  I'm turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
In the kitchen whippin' yola, mix it with the soda
Bitch I'm gone, smokin' strong, you can smell the odor
Nigga really think he Tony, bitch I think I'm Sosa
Hatin' niggas, hatin' bitches, got me turnin' over
I done smoked so much dope today
A nigga can't even think straight
And I done chopped so many O's today
I'm feelin' like a fuckin' sensei
Niggas' vibes tellin' me they been fake
Niggas' eyes tellin' me they been snake
They be the same niggas screamin' they your dog
But they'll kill your ass for less than 10K
'Cause these niggas ain't shit and these hoes ain't neither
Only bitch I love is my best friend Nina
'Cause she never did me wrong and she always held me down
Nigga act crazy, she gon' RIP 'em
Jaws ask me why I trap shit, I say 'cause
It give me clothes, give me hoes, and it give me buzz
They ain't my family, but these fiends, shit they show me love
The life of a trapstar, I'ma live it up

[Chorus: PnB Chizz]
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody

This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies

Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
Turnin' over,  I'm turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over

[Verse 2: PnB Chizz]
Them boys don't want no bodies at all
My twenty-two hold ten and ten, boy you better step off
No I ain't the ref, so get me stressed, I let this TEC off
Only one thing left to do nigga, that's ball
These fake friends bad for business
I'ma start collecting rent from these tenants
Other side the pillow is always cooler
I'm turning over on all of you niggas
Only stay around to be in my business
Want to know every word in my sentence
Listen when it's war time a lot of bulls die
I'm droppin' bombs 'til all of you finished
Don't pay your rent, where you gon' stay?
And you turn up like all the way
Every day, every day
You tryna find a new fee
When I run shit they boom-by-yay
If you run shit don't come my way
Shit the boy to boy time 'bout to go
You ain't know, shit they call me Bobby Bouchet

[Chorus: PnB Chizz]
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies
Last year I was hangin' round anybody
This year won't be 'round anybody
They be shootin' in the crowd hittin' any bodies
Them boys don't want no work, they don't want any bodies

Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over
Turnin' over,  I'm turnin' over
Last year I was with it, now I'm turning over

[Verse 1]
Spit it for the streets cause I know that this is what they want
When it come to work for them fiends I got that A-1
When I say that A-1, I ain't talkin’ steak sauce
Bitch I’m talkin’ 9, 10, quarters and them 8 balls
Spit it for the jails- know what a cell feel like
Prolly ain't gon' be a fucking star but bitch I still write
Rest in peace to Moe
I miss 'em we was real tight
Shit, ain't a day ain't around it don't feel right
All I do is get high, fuck bitches, get fly
Blowing money fast while these niggas barely get by
Don't know how they falter
Niggas always broke, man
But everywhere you go them fiends always wanna smoke, man
That's why i got that work
Fucking with them O's
The same amount you payin man, I fuck that up on clothes
And I make it right back
Cause i be in the trap, this money outta town nigga thats a known fact
Where my real hittas at?

Put your chopper to the sky and wave it side to side
She keep it real high 'til the law come
And when they come, just pray
Just cause they make the law, we gon' break it
That's real shit
Real niggas do real things
Loyalty is a lifestyle that niggas don't live, man
Lean told me that when I was upstate
Did a little bid, he was real cause he wrote me back
Real nigga facts, I sold crack to my man mom
When i was on my grind tryna get back
Can't change the past nor I can predict the future
This the gutter that mean it was real like Martin Luther
I had a dream I would make it some day
No job, DCC5, shit I was slanging yay
Know what I do is wrong, that's why everyday I pray
Officer lights [?] and continue with my day
Shit, fuck it I can't help it I'ma hustle up
Movin' weight these niggas still pushing double up
Been doing this since my bitch was playing double dutch
And we the same age since a youngin' I was cuttin' up
Choppin' up raw, hood on smash
58, 12-12 skinnies put it in the back
That was in the past this the present time
Nigga need work you say hold' let me call my line
'What's up ROCK where you at? I need a couple jars"
Like nigga why you cussing on my fucking phone
And got called back on another jack
"Nah word, I got what you need just bring my cash"
Send my youngin' on a mission bring that chicken back
Even my youngins getting chicken we ain't flippin pack
Where they do that at, not around here
And if you ain't from 'round here no need to come around here

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I just want it all, I just wanna ball
Me and all my homies spending millions in the mall
Came a long way from hustling up in the hall
Waiting on a trip for customer to call
Baby want the crib with the mini waterfall
Balmain and Hermes, vacations in the fall
Vacations in the winter at a tropical resort
100 P's in the town that I'm tryna cop 'em all
Then Tryna knock 'em off, then tryna cop some more
You was talking tough shit this what the Glock for
You could tell these hoes you married
My niggas ain't from Houston but we let them rockets off
You ain't doing shit but you said you poppin' off
You really got that bag and drop it off
This is PnB Rock and Ghost from D-Block
I want it all if it's dirty money give me a detox

[Hook]
I just want it all right now
I just wanna ball right now
Swear, I want everything, everything

 [Verse]
Oh, yeah
Last year I was locked up, I was in a cell
This year now I'm on charts, I'ma give 'em hell
Been through a lot of shit
Before I ever seen the fame and the glory
Before you judge me and think you above me
Lemme tell you a story
Yeah, let me take you way back
I'm talkin' way, way before the deal
Yeah, I'm talkin' way, way back
Back when shit was super real
My mama have five boys
Three baby daddies, two of 'em got killed
The other one was a deadbeat
Might as well say that nigga got killed
Growin' up without a dad
Always had it bad, we was in and out of shelters
Crazy how we had family all around the world
And really, ain't nobody really help us
My mama went and got a boyfriend that beat her ass
I remember feelin' helpless
Swear, I wish I could fucking catch him
Swear, man, I would fuckin' wet him
Yeah, shit, uh
Man, it's crazy how the times change
'Cause lately I've been in a different mind frame
And lately I've been thinkin' 'bout the bigger picture
Thinkin' 'bout my brother, man, I miss that nigga
When he got killed that night I wish that I was with that nigga
Swear, I wish heaven was like jail when I could visit niggas
Speakin' of visits, I'm screaming "free Shotty"
Can't even lie, I need the go see Shotty
Lately I've been trippin', I've been actin' different
I've been fake busy, I've been fuckin' all these bitches
Sometimes I got caught up in the fame
But my loyalty to you will never change, bro, don't get it twisted
My mama and my baby mama say that I been distant
But really I just been takin' care of business
Think about this shit in a couple months
Leave it up to me and we all gon' be livin' different
I'm talkin' big houses, big cars, and big business
I'm tryna put my niggas in the good position
I'm tryna pay Milan whole school tuition
So she ain't gotta worry 'bout these fuck niggas
I'm teachin' her right now not to trust niggas
And anything that she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know if you cross her then you cross me
Pressure, this for all my niggas that done left for us
And everybody tellin' me I'm next up
I gotta stay strong through it all
And act like I ain't goin' through it all, through this pressure
Oh, yeah
