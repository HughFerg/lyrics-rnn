 Lyrics from snippet

... hot sauce
Got a nigga baby mama

21 Savage, I go [?]
Fuck the struggle, let the money wash away the time (21)
Never turn my back for fame




 [Verse 1]
Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my gang, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
Makin' sure my kids happy
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me

[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Verse 2]
And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"
My old ho sayin', "Boy you growed up"
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Outro]
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover




 [Verse 1]
Jumped out the Porsche, got to it
Choppa on me, bitch I shoot like I'm Cupid
Model bitch, and she gon' blow me like hookah (yeah)
All these diamonds, bitch I look like a jeweler (21!)
Rollie froze, bitch it came out the cooler
Tech 9, bitch it came with a cooler
I got shooters that'll shoot at your shooter (yeah)
Bitch you broke, you eatin' noodles and oodles (21)
I got a bad bitch, workin' Hooters (21)
Bitch I get the check, and you know I blew it (21) (I get it)
21 gang, chain hangin', blangin' (21)
Jewish lawyers, give a fuck about that rangin' (21)
Seinfeld, niggas frontin' like Kramer
Put you on the news, you wanna be famous (21)
Zoom on six, bitch you know that I claimed it
I jumped out the Porsche and broke my ankle (gang, gang)

[Verse 2]
I'm scrapin' the bud when I cook it up (21)
Your main bitch want me to pick her up (21)
I nut in her face, she gon' lick it up
Your jewelry shinin'? We gon' stick you up (stick ya up)
Like 2Pac, nigga, hit 'em up (hit 'em up)
These niggas tough on the Internet (21)
Gettin' that pussy, I'm killin' that (I'm killin')
I'm not just a rapper, I'm livin' that (I'm livin' that)

[Verse 3]
Shawty said she want that dick, I told that bitch to wait one minute (wait one minute!)
These niggas broke, I heard these niggas shoppin' J.C. Penny (21, 21)
I took that bitch to Ruth Chris, I heard a nigga eats at Wendy's
I'm a real nigga, I can't wear no gold unless they came from the [?]
[cont.??]




 [Verse 1]
I'm sippin' Act I'm sippin' Act
This shit here worth more than cocaine
Come get your hoe I got your hoe
She say she wanna hang with the gang
I wanna Bentley I want a rarri
Wanna buy my bitch A ring
Yeah I'm fresh up out the trap
But bitch I'm dressed in Balmain
You Niggas Know I Rep That Murda
Terrorisin' Like Hussein
And my niggas juggin', servin'
Bouldercrest To Oakland Lane
Trappin' hard I'm trappin' Hard
My Money taller than Jermaine
Them Young nigga ready to roll Yea
Give A Fuck about yo stain
I Hit Yo Hoe For About An Hour
Took a shower then I changed
And I gave her A few hundred
Cause I didn't have no change
I spent a 20 on a Rollie
With no diamonds it was plain
No The Feds Investigating
But I'm Stiffer Than A Manne

I just cooked a whole brick

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm water whipping in the kitchen
Shit on niggas like a pigeon
Tie your kids up like a ribbon
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Baking soda on the stove
Dad knocking at the door
He don't want nothing but a nickel rock, man
We gone send him to the store
I just bought a whole
I whipped it out the bowl
Mac 90 with the 100 round drum
Nigga and it fold
I'm sticking to the code
Wipe a nigga nose
I'm Murder Gang Savage
And I slaughter niggas' hoes

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Water whipping in the kitchen

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Young Savage cooking crack
Sonny rolling grams of wax
Margiela cost a rack
Say my name I'll get you whacked
Streets need Gucci back
Smoke a nigga like a black
Want a million dollars, want a new Ferrari, wanna fuck Karrueche in the trap
I'm smoking on a pound of dank
Make the dope lock up in the sink
I wanna fuck you, but I can't
That pussy musty, bitch you stank
Medication all I drank
VVS, it make you faint
Rifle singing like Tank
I'm water whipping to the bank

 [Hook]
Aye I pull up to the Yo with a chopper and my son
Slaughter Gang bomb shit, nigga like Saddam
100 round drum on my stick
50 round drum on my hip
I pull up and let the shit rip
Bankroll like I'm Tip
Flipping work, acrobatic
Who the fuck want static
Young savage bitch I'm shhh
Young savage bitch I'm trapping
Catch a nigga ass in traffic
Roll the window down and shhh
Roll it down and let him have it
We the ones causing havoc

[Verse 1]
We the ones causing the havoc
Make the white jump like a rabbit
I took your bitch to the cabins
Wipe your nose like I'm Calvin
Paid in full if you ain't know
I ain't chasing no hoe
I ain't worried about a bitch
I keep me extended clips
Young savage, Fresh Jones
I just poured a 4 inside a Jones
I might take your baby mama home
She gon' suck me up and give me dome
Rap niggas I ain't really with it
Shit you rapping about, bitch I really did it
She ain't got no money, I can't hit it
Put some bullet holes in your fitted
She let me nut on her titty
If I say shovel, I dig it
Gangbanging like I'm Suge
Red rag in my Dickies
Slaughter Gang bitch I claim that
Diss me, get aimed at
Fuck around and get your chain snatched
How much you pay for your chain back ?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cooking up cocaine
Smoking on propane
I can't wife a hoe, mane
I just want throat, mane
I keep a 30 on my waist
Homicide, I beat the case
Spray the stick like it's some mace
Get your whole block erased
I get the shit from across the border
Break them down and take your order
You play with the gang, you'll get slaughtered
Pull up on your bitch and slaughter
Fresh eating a turkey burger
His chopper make you do the Shmurda
Free that nigga Bobby Shmurda
You niggas know I rep that murder
These niggas sneak dissing, I know it
I run through that check like I'm Floyd
Blowing money like I'm Floyd
Knock a nigga out like Floyd
I just went to cop a Porsche
I just went to cop a Rolls
Strip a nigga out his clothes
Your favorite rapper is a hoe

 [Intro: 21 Savage]
So cold
My heart so cold

[Hook: 21 Savage]
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
My heart so cold, I’m sticking to the code
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don’t fold
I’m tricking J’s daily, selling sheetrock for blow
In my younger days nigga I was robbing stores
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom seem like you ain’t got hope
And when you got kids nigga anything will go
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Can’t digest these percocets, they got my chest fucked up
Pussy niggas shot me six times, my luck fucked up
Hundred band lick pussy nigga, now I’m fucked up

[Hook: 21 Savage]
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit

[Verse 2: Freaky]
Fast paper had me dropping out of school
Violating laws, breaking all the rules
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging ‘round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas’ partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts
And just because we paid, the stress don’t decay
Still thinking ‘bout them losses, winning never made ‘em fade
With Gs being dead and [?] on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can’t do the shit I didn’t do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin’ me ‘cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok, no
Man just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok

[Hook: 21 Savage]
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit




 [Chorus]
Help me, can you help me?
I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla
Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher
I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching death tolls

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the trenches, pull up in the trenches!
I said that shit on woe, dog
I got the juice like O-Dog
I got 'caine like I'm Kane
Me and Lotto in that fucking Fisker switching lanes
Pull up on a pussy nigga and fuck on his main
I just spent a fifty-thousand dollars on a chain
I just spent a twenty on a motherfucking ring
Young Savage bitch, I got this shit off cocaine
Skrt, skrt, skrt
Pull up on your bitch and give her that skrr
Pull up on your bitch and drop that work
Yeah, and I'm still getting paid
Bitches getting slaughtered, man these bitches getting slayed
Keep that Glock 40, dare a nigga to touch my chain
I shoot this motherfucker like my name Max Payne

[Chorus]
Help me, can you help me?
I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla
Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher
I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching death tolls

[Verse 2]
I'm a dog like Michael Vick
I used to sell them Michael Vicks
I can't even lie, I ain't never sold a brick
But I got some partners who done really sold them bricks
Young Savage bitch and I done really hit them licks
I really put that pistol on these pussy nigga's shit
Run up on a nigga, better take a nigga shit
If your diamond's hitting you could take a nigga bitch
I hit four hundred and went a bought a 'vette
Your diamonds so cloudy, who the fuck sold you that shit?
You know damn well don't no Rolex fucking tick
Get your motherfucking money up nigga, try again nigga, 21
Oil based dope, I gotta try again
Dope got wet, it gotta dry again
Pussy ass rappers telling lies again
Pussy ass, bitch ass fuck boy

[Chorus]
Help me, can you help me?
I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla
Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher
I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching death tolls

No stressin'
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga!
No stressin'
I troop, lil' nigga I bless you

[Verse: 21 Savage]
[?] tellin' in a [?], it's not a Tesla
Somebody called 911, he need a stretcher




 [Verse 1]
A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop
I hit for a hunnit' and I bought me a drop
I pulled up on her and panties just drop
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop
Off with your top (head), give a fuck bout your block 1 2
High speed chasing, give a fuck bout the cops
When I see 12, put the dope in my sock
Niggas be rappin, I came up off rocks
I'm thuggin', Im thuggin', I feel like I'm Pac
They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas actin like bitches, niggas all in they feelings
These niggas acting like women
Drowning in money, I'm swimmin'
These bitches acting like pigeons
I just want a couple million, I just want a couple million
And I'm still loyal to the gang
These other niggas man, they lame
I really sold cocaine, Gas stank propane
Glock forty, nigga bang, Blood, Crip, nigga bang
I heard ya got ya chain took and had to get another damn chain
21 nigga the gang, slaughter ya daughter the gang
Mac 90 got range, young savage got aim
I bought a new Rollie, its plain, you niggas best stay in yo lane
I pull up and fuck on yo main
I'm covered in money, I'm drippin
These niggas they telling, they snitchin'
So we gon' fuck on all they bitches, I be round lot of henchmen
Moving like I'm John Gotti, 12 gauge nigga shotty
Hit 'em all in the body, I just caught another body
Lord forgive me I'm sorry, I can't help it, I'm a street nigga
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle

[Hook]
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

[Verse 2]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was struggling tryna win
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga tryna chase them m's
Cooking up crack its illegal, riding with a Desert Eagle
I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal
Hunnid pounds of Cali reefer, Call of duty heat seeker
Pull up on ya in a Regal, window down nigga creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal
In the trenches, niggas beefing, i remember not sleeping
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, i was living like a demon

[Interlude]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take

[Hook]
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

 [Verse 1]
Peon ass niggas
Levis and Adidas ass niggas
Hi-Point having ass niggas
I got a Glock and it don't jam, I blast niggas
You a lovey dovey buy a ring nigga
I'm the type to pass her to the team, nigga
You went and bought that bitch Céline, nigga?
Now she fuckin' me, I know you wanna kill her
And I sold dope on my 10 toes
We ain't fallin' out over freak hoes
21 Savage still in savage mode
I thought I told you I'm a savage on these hoes
Maybach with the curtains up
I'm with Nudy, he gon' burn you up
Fake gangbangin', nigga turned into a snitch
Went against that 21, I left him in a ditch

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up
We like gas, we like gas, gas, gas
Hol' up
We like cash, we like cash, cash, cash
Hol' up
Wanna fuck me, I'm like yas, yas, yas

Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch I came straight from the bottom, nigga and I'm still humble
Auto start my whip before I dip, I let that bitch rumble
AK-47s, M16s, they gon' sting, bumble
Got your main bitch with me bent over eatin' meat, gumbo

[Verse 2]
Money talk, yeah, nigga, cash talk, yeah, nigga
Ridin' 'round with that yappa tryna duck the feds, nigga
Oh you drinkin' green? Nope, only drink that red, nigga
Only fuck the bad hoes, buy my cars with cash, ho
Niggas know I blast off, pull up with the mask off
Air it out like aerosol, I robbed Peter and Paul
Bought a 488, finna act an asshole
I've been gettin' so much money, they think I sold my damn soul
You a fake gangsta, you ain't ever shot nobody
I don't wanna hear them stories 'bout them fake bodies
Young Savage send a hit like John Gotti
Nigga get whacked, thinkin' they hard 'cause they on molly
I'm the Saint Laurent Don, love to cash out
You a dick jumpin' faggot, you a mascot
You beat your bitch 'cause she walk 'round with her ass out
They wanna rob me 'cause I walk 'round with that bag out
Drinkin' syrup, lil' bitch, I'm finna pass out
Never slippin', Glock 40 with a red dot
Seven figure nigga, money all I talk about
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, what ya talkin' 'bout?

[Chorus]
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo

How the fuck is you a shooter, you ain't hit no target
Bitch I'm 21 Savage and I do not argue
Niggas always in they feelin's cause they soft like Charmin
But I'm screamin' fuck feelin's nigga where's my condom

[Verse 1]
Ain't no incidental
Sticks inside the rental
Slide the door back
Shoot you out this rental
I don't need a shooter
Savage, he'll shoot ya
Smokin' on a Cuban
But I still eat noodles
VVS's, wow-wow
Bitch I let you wow-wow
That Tec'll bless ya, wow
21, pew-pew-pew, blaow
I finesse'd him, how?
It was easy, how?
He pulled up to the house
I ran off, made him pout, 21
Her booty nice and fat
I put the team on that
Put a beam on that
Slaughter Gang, we screamin' that
I do magic tricks, turn 1 to 2 cat in the hat
You with that sneaky shit, you might get one put in your hat

[Hook]
I got dope fiends and task force knockin'
When you get more money then you get more problems

You might get sprayed bout this, 21

[Hook]

 [Verse 1]
They thought I only rapped about murder and pistols
I'm tryna feed my family, I ain't being political
You ain't givin' out money then they look at you pitiful
You make a couple million, niggas greedy, they envy you
Ayy, fuck that other side, we gon' shoot up your Sprinter
I used to sell that crack and spray that MAC out that rental
Niggas run and hide when we roll down the window
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he can't wait 'til December
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he gon' shoot you on camera
Lost his faith in Jesus Christ, he prayin' to a bandana
Police gunned his brother down, this shit too hard to handle
Loadin' up his chopper, he gon' show 'em black lives matter

[Chorus]
Another nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new
Mama on that dog food, it ain't nothin' new
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new
All his friends gang bangin', it ain't nothin' new
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too

[Verse 2]
Shit gettin' outrageous
Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages
Young, black, poor, ain't had a father since a baby
Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?
Why you think we ridin' 'round with choppers off safety?
Streets cutthroat, nigga, so I'm cutthroat
I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear the mama's cryin' now

[Chorus]
Another nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new
Mama on that dog food, it ain't nothin' new
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new
All his friends gang bangin', it ain't nothin' new
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too




 [Verse 1]
Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin'
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain’t on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

[Verse 2]
It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up
Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no pictures, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

[Verse 3]
Numb the pain with the money and I ride 'round with that Tommy
And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
All I got is money bags on my brain
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame

Come on my block, get extorted man
Dope on my margella, dope on my wrist and my fist cuz I'm cooking up coca man
Windmilling that pot like a hurricane
And I hope you don't think that we broke man
Come to the north and its Cokeland
The critics, say change my attitude

Don't make me show you what the Mac 11 do
Better watch out, you'll get life with that dog food

[Chorus: Offset]
Standing in the trap, made a hundred thousand
Call up Domingo, he pull up extension, he glaowed him

Scrape the corner, buy a Rover
Crack inside my grandmas sofa
Sunday, family coming over
Move the crack behind the toaster
Carry pistols with no holsters
Trying not to be a poster
You was listening to your coaches
I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sippin' potion
We happy, dog but we ain't joking
Big bullets, we ain't poking
In that pussy, slow motion
Nigga ain't none of my songs wrote

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you

[Verse 2]
Hoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming "Fuck you, they want to eat you"
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall I can hear 'em rattle
(That fuck nigga gone flop man
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bully, do him like Craig did Deebo
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' cat, I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the stick's out
Too much money got 'em pissed off
Nigga, I'ma pull up at yo bitch house
Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it
Nigga pop percs, 'gone get a kick out it
Drinking on syrup with my dick out
Glock-17 with the dick out

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you

If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you

[Verse 3]
All my tint presidential, like I'm Trump, dawg
Secret service shooters, leave 'em niggas slumped, dawg
Denzel, I get surgical with this pump, dawg
Busting down, breaking down, then I put it in a blunt, dawg
Made a mess now, I got 21 washed out
In my face, teetee and taytay in the same count
I was down, bad and now I'm shining like a lamp
You put a ring on her, she ain't nothing but a tramp
The kicked me outta middle school and sent me to the house
We 'bout that gunplay, nigga, motherfuck 'yo count
19, I bought a Cutlass, four 12's and an amp
Beating down Glenwood, nigga, feeling like a champ
Nigga, we ain't takin' no deals
Lil nigga we ain't snitchin', we ain't making no sound
Used to jump niggas, now we jumping in a crowd
Used to make my mama cry, but now I make her proud
I remember rainy days but now she like the sound

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you

 [Verse]
Life ain't been no walk through the park, where do I start?
Young nigga selling rock and robbin', just not to starve
He never paid attention in school, can't get a job
Plus he confused, most of his partners behind bars, he turned to God
Asking Him why he was dealt these cards, he feeling odd
His blood is cold, his heart's scarred but he's a street nigga
He got a pistol, he gon' eat nigga
He give a fuck about a bitch or a weak nigga and that's real
And if that ain't real then tell me what it is
My cousin, 19, they gave his ass 20 years
My nigga Larry died and I'm still shedding tears
But I salute him cause he kept it real
But there's a lot of fakes
Backstabbing ass hoes and snakes
They turn on their people for a little piece of cake
And when you make it to the top, these fuck niggas hate
But I'm okay cause I know one day
That I'ma leave and they gon' know that I was 100
21, bitch
