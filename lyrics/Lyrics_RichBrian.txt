[Intro]
I ain't really finna' tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

[Verse 1]
Ride with a couple friends
Live like I'm Kurt Cobain
Tail, then you try again
What can't you understand
Yeah, we gon' bring the pain
Man, this is all a game
We out here changing lanes
They gotta match our pace




 [Verse 1]
I'm givin' my number to any bitch lookin' like Ronda
I'm Gunner Stahl, I'm takin' many pics
I'm thinkin' 'bout havin' many kids
Even Osama gon' be like, "Goddamn that's a lot of kids"
Hit 'em with a good amount of the hits
I'm thinkin' will I put 'em out of the biz?
Shout to $uicideBoy$, kill ‘em all, rest in piss
Sip on LaCroix on the bus that I missed
Talkin' 'bout somethin' that I never did
I talk to myself, and all my seven chicks
They love to go down just like your relevance
I'm a rapper, but my name isn't Chance
Come to my show, people think I'm intense
Don't look at me, somethin' wrong with your lens
One day the money's gon' be for the Benz
Flow be so dirty, it needed a cleanse
I'm in my zone, I went through this shit alone
Didn't have no friends, talk to myself we always get along
I'm still learnin', I'm still fuckin' up, correct me if I'm wrong
Talkin' business more than usual that means I'm out with Sean (88)
Never yellow in my urinal, I'm always drinkin' on that Pellegrino
I been rockin' my own merch, I'm makin' way more green than CeeLo
I saw people from my school, they all turned out to be some weirdos
I don't need no education, Internet's my favorite teacher

[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy, told 'em, told 'em

[Verse 2]
Told that bitch that I don't really give a fuck 'bout you
Told that man that he gotta quit, it ain't cool
Makin' up for the confrontation that I ain't do
As a teen, all the fight I've been in was virtual
Now I'm gettin' old, and my dick is gettin' older
Keep seven bitches on my phone like a folder
When they were 18, man I was a toddler
Damn, homeschool felt like yesterday
I worked at my mom's cafe
Met a girl like every day
It's my only social place
They thought I was from LA
No I'm not, but now I'm here
Tryna fill my parents' plate
They call me up like every day
People say I'm good, they say I get what I should
Tell me not to worry, everything will go real smooth
People think I'm Dory, I'm forgettin' 'bout my hood
Man, should I be sorry for just doin' somethin' new?
Man, these dudes gotta be more quiet than they think
They be hella sure, but I always say amen
Do the shit for the people that look like me
So the girls can see them and they think of me
And not that kid that throw that fit
'Cause he didn't get straight A's all week




 [Intro: AUGUST 08]
Yeah, yeah, da, da, da
Said, ah, ah, ah, no starvin', ahem, yeah

[Verse 1: AUGUST 08]
Hope is gone, is gone, since I've been in Arizona, yeah
I fell in love, in love, since I've been in Arizona
Ooh, when the sun comes through the blinds, I know exactly who to call
Watching the sunset in your eyes but I spend the night alone

[Chorus: AUGUST 08]
Ooh, in Arizona, in Arizona, in Arizona
Ooh, in Arizona, in Arizona, in fucking Arizona

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Transporting through the land, searching for the desert sand
World tour, Jodeci, "Diary of a Mad Band"
4 AM, microdose, feelin' like a mad man
Don't want none of that, eyes on the game plan
Pink haze, lemonade, Ma said, “Brian can’t misbehave”
But I feel like Yeezy beamin' out the Milky Way
People try to stop me, but I'm surfing through the waves
I know, not yet in my peak don't need to give a lightshow
People wonderin' where in the fuck is Indo
Starin' at my screen, I need a fuckin' window
Yeah, cold out so I wear a mink coat
Damn, it feel good to be a boss
Eyes wide open like I'm smokin' on the rocks
Never spent bread even though I got a lot
Still like to rap even though I sing a lot
Money flipper, I'm earnin' burnin' Catalina wine mixer
Workin' out so much, you might just see me in the Sixers
I'm lookin' pretty good, you might just wanna hide your sisters
I put 'em in their feelings, get them listenin' to SZA
Top down, ass up, pussy so good got me doin' backflips
Vivid memories of her on my mattress
Damn it taste good, drink it from the cactus
Zero gravity in the room like NASA
All I hear is heartbeats goin' faster
Mention everything, fuck it it's the last song
Asked you a question, where's the fuckin' answer?

[Chorus: AUGUST 08]
Ooh, in Arizona, in Arizona, in Arizona
Ooh, in Arizona, in Arizona, in fucking Arizona

[Verse 3: Rich Brian]
Everyday I gotta regulate, only thing you couldn't do was pray
Remind me of the pussy that I ate, hit 'em with another power play
Man, let’s face it, they don’t really listen to the music
They just want to take a trend and then go use it
Been a minute since I heard a lyric
That can move somebody and their feelings
I just started spittin' and I'm killin' it
I love these women I'm a feminist
I just talk and they call me a lyricist
I'ma make a debut album after this
It's the end, but I'm just getting started
Feel like the finale and the pilot's being friends
I'm the one and only
But I swear about a thousand Indonesian kids will come with me

[Outro: Rich Brian]
Say goodbye to your baby girl
Say goodbye to your picket fence
You're about to get drafted, drafted
Drafted in the war games
We've been watchin' down in Panama
Within our Valentino camouflage
Lookin' like I'm drafted, drafted
Drafted in the war games

[Skit: Rich Brian & Sean Miyashiro]
Yeah, I fuckin' love The Office
Dude, when I saw the season finale I literally cried
I cried, I've never cried that hard before
Really? Why?
Yeah, 'cause it was so emotional
What happened?
What?
What happened?
Um, Michael Scott fuckin' died
Really?
Yeah
How?
Umm, I think he died from a heart attack. He couldn't like handle the depression of the office anymore
Oh my god
Yeah
Were people crying?
Yeah
Damn, I did not know that
Mm-hmm
He died?
Yeah
So they killed him off the show?
Yeah, on the last fuckin' episode
Amen




 [Chorus: Rich Brian]
Pull a mil' in a day, ain't even have the goddamn bill
On your pill, everyday I just be sippin' Chamomile
Mass appeal, everybody show up 'cause they know I'm here
Every week, I be on the face, she think it's Cetaphil
Up in my business, pull up in my bitch crib
I got people locked and loaded like they trained for ISIS
Askin' for forgiveness, I never said you have it
Pullin' all these dimes like, do you really want attention?

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Photo shoot the second I go out
Catch me chillin' with Offset in a luau
You gotta give a resume so I can see what you're about
Fuck your Snapchat, fuck your camera
I need space like astronaut
Please don't make me pull up on you
Like Tom Sawyer, like to get right to the point
And my sneakers match my sweater, I got hella sauce like soy
Like my dad, I'm the man, don't wanna see me mad
What you doin'? Is you lost? Go ahead and call a cab, ayy
Yesterday my mother called me, she told me that she be worried
'Bout my food and what I eatin', I tell her it's calamari
D'usse when I got no plans, sippin' on it after dinner
You say you hang with the man, I see him when I'm in the mirror

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Pull a mil' in a day, ain't even have the goddamn bill
On your pill, everyday I just be sippin' Chamomile
Mass appeal, everybody show up 'cause they know I'm here
Every week, I be on the face, she think it's Cetaphil
Up in my business, pull up in my bitch crib
I got people locked and loaded like they trained for ISIS
Askin' for forgiveness, I never said you'll have it
Pullin' all these guns, but do you really want attention?

[Verse 2: Offset]
Diamonds on my wrist got her attention (hey!)
When I pulled up in that drop top, Fonzworth Bentley (skrrt!)
I heard your main bitch, she got me in her mentions (hey!)
I am a Martian, I am not from this dimension (no!)
All of this water drippin' on my Paddy, like I rinsed it (drip)
Fuck on your daughter, I won't test a bet, she in detention
Drip drop, Gucci socks, bought my bitch Givenchy (hey!)
Your tick tock, Rolex watch, plain Jane, keepin' it simple (plain)
Young rich nigga, in the trap with rich niggas
Ain't goin' for a bitch nigga, choppa flip niggas (skrrt!)
On my way up to eight figures, I don't need nigga
No police, my neck on freeze, my dog breed killas

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Pull a mil' in a day, ain't even have the goddamn bill
On your pill, everyday I just be sippin' Chamomile
Mass appeal, everybody show up 'cause they know I'm here
Every week, I be on the face, she think it's Cetaphil
Up in my business, pull up in my bitch crib
I got people locked and loaded like they trained for ISIS
Askin' for forgiveness, I never said you'll have it
Pullin' all these guns, but do you really want attention?




 [Intro]
Woah, Yeah, Uh, Ay

[Verse 1]
Back on my bullshit man you can't believe it
Who the fuck just said I should quit, they gon' prolly take it back
We make the people book it, see the zeros goin' up
And we just gettin' started, why you always talkin' shit
Go look at your deposit, always got excuses
But I never see the problem, why you never made it yet
Talkin all that shit, but you never seem to back it up
I don't blame you if I were you I would be mad as fuck
Run it run it back, stop makin' false accusations
I didn't go international that's where I fuckin started
Then I went local all of you fuckers start recognizing
You too focused bout appearances and flexin' for nobody
God damn, every move I do is on the cam, if I say another word
I might just end up on the gram, lookin' at this year's blueprint
You know it's full of plans, yo career is goin' slow no need to take another xan

[Hook]
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me

[Verse 2]
H-H-Hotels got me sleepin' well, every week a new touchdown like I'm Odell
Now he's talkin' bout his lifestyle if you couldn't tell that it's all he fuckin' talk about, man we can't relate
Shit what can I say I don't look rich, I don't wear a golden chain, I don't drive a cool whip, this only way I can flex
For your main bitch, I'm just sayin' what I feel had it with the fake shit
Can't forget about me cuz I'm always on the timeline
I been learning bout the market got me on the limelight
Never been speaker I just think of shit like Einstein
Never make the wrong move I look at shit with hindsight
Yea man, hold my glass, boutta take my shot she better catch
Hit that ass got me reminiscing bout the past, you don't get the picture
Always gotta take em with the flash, hip game on hourglass (shit)

[Hook]
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me

[Outro]
Let me do me
Please just let me do me




 [Intro]
Yeah, happy birthday to me
I'm 18 now
And women can legally have sex with me
Shout out Based God

[Chorus]
I be ridin' right down Melrose with a thicky named Rose
Sittin' on my lap, but she just tryna be my friend, though
Bumpin' on that XO and I'm 'bout to call my ex ho
Mommy, daddy home, I barely see them like a rainbow

[Verse 1]
You can't get rid of me, I ain't goin' nowhere
And I'm always multiplyin' like I always fornicate
Cake, cake up on this belt, the day I landed in the States
Doin' one take all day and I'm just spittin' out the mace (mace)
She like sippin' out that mason jar
She a hippie, she gon' suck for some granola bars
Little freaky got me curious like I'm on Mars
Sayin', I forgot my roots, goddamn, you went too far

[Bridge]
Ayy, damn you went too far
Got these people all around me, man, that treat me like a star
Dressed like I don't give a damn, but I be ballin' like LaVar
Gotta wait about three years, until I could go to the bar

[Verse 2]
Damn, make all my own shit, I get all the profits
If you actin' lazy, then do not expect your props, bitch
Movin' with the tactics, got Gildan on my fabrics
Go ham on the mic, just like I'm sitting in the cockpit, ayy
Used to hate the camera, now your boy's a natural
Now your boy is on the road two months and I'ma get the load
Try to put me in a box, I'm gon' always break the lock
Call me D-Wayne, 'cause she licking on my Johnson like The Rock
Oh my God, man, his voice so deep, I thought he was 21 plus
Brian be so clean, wanna let him spank on my bum
He just turned 18, but for him, I'd catch a case, damn (hold up)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayy, that was the sound of yo' bitch
And everybody that heard what I did
I don't like being so ignorant
But you gon' make me go back to my bullshit again

[Chorus]
I be ridin' right down Melrose with a thicky named Rose
Sittin' on my lap, but she just tryna be my friend, though
Bumpin' on that XO and I'm 'bout to call my ex ho
Mommy, daddy home, I barely see them like a rainbow




 [Verse 1]
Saw a car crash, it remind me of our first date
Then I went back, got massages at that one place
Always brought friends but today I feel like doin' this shit alone
Callin' my dad when I wanna hear some wisdom
Callin' my cab alcohol up in my system
Saw a fist fight and that shit don't even make me scared no more
Man, I never been the one to be alone
All my friends are always hittin' up my phone
Every day is spent with everybody, never on my own
But today I'm by myself and I don't even feel alone
Like to smoke cigs every time I feel the outside
Like to play chicks but get mad when they get new guys
You don't get me but I don't blame you, I don't get myself
Pressin' on keys, got my life so sweet man
GoFundMe on your bitch's pinned tweet man
Bumpin' oldies as I try to dick her down
She said give it to me now, and I can't help but listen
She go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"
Slippery sign all over my door
Show some attitude and bitch I won't show
Expectation high, I feel like a drone
2018, I got some new goals
Not checkin' my statement 'til I got 4 mill
Rushin' all year like I commit roadkill
Killin' everybody like I'm in a wrong deal
Do triple checks on every move I make
Work 'til I'm tired then sip on some latte
Only do shit if we do it my way
Everything gon' depend on what I say
3, 4

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hold up, wait a second
Man, my flow on lethal weapon
Hit 'em with the rhymin' pattern
Put these rappers under pressure
This feel like Armageddon
If she witcha I'ma get her
Cut you off like Jerry Heller
She gon' need another fella, ayy
I don't take drugs, I just take naps
Find another girl to eat up like I hate snacks
Dick gon' make her choke like reflux, gotta relax
Man, yo' shit is borin' and it's makin' me go sleep fast
And I always care 'bout everybody but myself
That's the life of a Virgo, never gettin' mad
That's not the Brian that we know
I just weighed my heart, it's about 30 kilos
I just fucked a lady and she 'bout 30 years old
Rappin' on this instrumentals, feelin' like a hero
Never usin' triplet flows because I'm not a Migo
Only lastin' longer 'cause I'm drunk, I don't think she knows
Only thing that matters that my dick is like my ego
They wishin' I'ma fail
These days, no picnics, ain't no fun and games
Still, motherfuckas always got a lot to say
Never got love, so they spreadin' all this hate oh, oh
Man they always actin' real tough
But I show up for a show and they just wanna leave town
People sayin' that my words are colder than the winter
It's Brian, not Brita, so I'll never have a filter




 [Chorus: Rich Brian]
Yeah, wake up about, uh, 6
Think 'bout money, then 'bout this
I got nothin' on my wrist but I'll still gladly take your bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Who produced that beat? (yeah, ayy, yuh)
Yessiree I did, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Rich Brian]
Got that ass on me
Sound like I'm from New York City
Airbnb, gon' fuck in it
She know that I do the music (music)
Always cook at home, I'm tryna to save up
Tryna do my friends some favors
Gave her head, she facin' backwards (backwards, ayy)

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
27 shows, I go through cities every now and then
I watch the crowd, they jumpin', watchin' me (watchin' me)
Cut, cut to days ago
I'm just a kid not old enough to smoke a cig
They wonder, "What's the recipe?" (ayy, recipe)
They want me to come home
I can hear the drum roll
But understand I'm out here for a reason
Li-livin' in my own home
Father miss me, I know
But also he know that I'm on a mission (mission)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I got diamonds on my fist and shit
Diamonds on my wrist and shit
So icy, bitch, I'm colder than a freezer (bling-blaow)
My main bitch bitchin' (21), side bitch trippin'
Bitch I love ya'll both but none of y'all ain't no keepers
I'll leave ya, Rolls Royce look like Jeepers Creepers (21)
Made a million dollars with Adidas (21)
Can't have a ticket, nigga, off my beeper (21)
Take this shit to trial, nigga, I'm gon' beat it
Spilt my lean, it got me heated
Say it one time, I don't repeat it
Baby, get down on your knees and eat it, (wow) eat it, eat it
Walking out of Louis V with the big box
Yeah I pulled at Saint Laurent, I made a pit stop
Young Savage walk around with the big Glock (21)
With that .30 hangin' out, nigga that's hip-hop (facts)
Car too fast, 12 can't stop me (skrrt)
Bitch too bad, hoes can't fuck me (21)
You was running from the smoke, nigga, not me (on God)
Rich Chigga, 21 Savage, now it's O.D. (21)

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Yeah, wake up about, uh, 6
Think 'bout money, then 'bout this
I got nothin' on my wrist but I'll still gladly take your bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Who produced that beat? (yeah, ayy, yuh)
Yessiree I did, ayy

[Verse 3: Rich Brian]
She act like a bird
I wear shit made out of fur
Your man say he getting money
Claim that he's entrepreneur
Fast car like Fast & Furious
She throw it back, DeLorean
I'm sittin' in somebody's BMW recordin' this
Not my whip, not my whip
Rather walk or take a Lyft
On a trip, I hit the strip
That made me sad and then I dip
Ayy, Brian learnin' how to live it (damn)
People 'round him go in circles
Head is spinnin' with no fidget (recipe)
Used to play the drums though
Never liked it, no, no
Lil' Brian didn't see the bigger picture
Rap-rap on my own beats so
One hundred percent goes
Straight to my li'l pockets and I keep it

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Yeah, wake up about, uh, 6
Think 'bout money, then 'bout this
I got nothin' on my wrist but I'll still gladly take your bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Who produced that beat? (yeah, ayy, yuh)
Yessiree I did, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Rich Brian]
Got that ass on me
Sound like I'm from New York City
Airbnb, gon' fuck in it
She know that I do the music (music)
Always cook at home, I'm tryna to save up
Tryna do my friends some favors
Gave her head, she facin' backwards (backwards, ayy)




 [Verse 1]
12 in the mornin', pop shells for a livin'
And berry gon' smell blood trail every minute
Rogue wave on you niggas, no fail when I hit 'em
Every time I see a pig, I don't hesitate to kill 'em
Ain't nobody give a fuck about a rule
Either get diplomas or a tool, I'ma cool with my youngins
No bool when I'm sprayin' this K at you fuckas
Fuck a gang affiliated with nothin' but my name

[Chorus]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do', yeah

[Verse 2]
People be starvin'
And people be killin' for food with that crack and that spoon
But these rich mothafuckas, they stay eatin' good
Droppin' wage livin' good
Holdin' steel Glocks, but you been a bitch, suck a thick cock
Fuck a Crip walk, hit the strip like in Bangkok
Never ever see me have a trip ‘bout a lil’ broad
See me on the TV screamin', "Bitch, you a damn fraud"
And you don't wanna fuck with a chigga like me
When I pull up in that Maserati
Better duck 'fore ya brain splatter on the concrete
I'ma hit you with that .45, bullet hit yo neck round the bow tie
Lookin' like a thriller, film a bitch
I'ma go right back with the clip and I know you be shakin'
Don't test me or I might just click at yo noggin

[Chorus]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do', yeah




 [Hook: Rich Brian]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Don't give a fuck, poppin' bottles in the club
Tryna fuck Atlanta bitch but let her lick the pussy up
Turn your bitch into a dyke, finna need her baptized
Pool full of liquor, finna dive in her eyes
Bitch I don't care, finna fuck a bitch with no protection I be ignant
Pray to God I'ma die with my nine on my side
Mothafuck cops, bustin' like a pork, better hide
Put my dick in her mouth, call that shit a metapo
Cigarettes to my lungs 'til I let the pistol go
Look into my eyes, tell me what you wanna do
'Fore I kill you in the street with the rest of your crew
I did this, you know this, the mark on my cheek
Where the bullet grazed, and it almost took my life
Forgot what day feels like, I only live at night
Like a bat, not a rat, never die where you at, hoe

[Verse 2: Pouya]
I can’t see, walk, talk, been straight hoe breakin
Ain't nothin', the energy I generate
The underground underdog 'bout to fall off
Into another generation
I was workin, bussin' tables, now I got my own squid on the plate
Fuck the fame, baby, I don't wanna live in L.A
Back to the M-I-A to the M-I
Gon' lay with a ho, face in the coke lines
Toe taggin' rappers thinkin' that they're snappin'
Goin' bar to bar with me is suicide
You or I, do or die, baby, don't even worry about who am I
Bank account go stupid now
You should know about the whip situation (aye)
Tour been feelin' like a damn vacation
Germ fucked up, woke up not knowin' where he at
You was blacked out in the damn basement

[Hook: Rich Brian]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I don't give two fucks, I blow big bucks
Strip club, white pussy marks on my black tux
'Cause after the party's the hotel lobby
And that bitch gonna give me more head than Steve Harvey
I keep a duffle bag, not like the money team
All coked out on a scale of a triple beam
Nah mean? Fuck a team of guerrillas
Silverback stomp out your gang of chinchillas
Suitcase, military scopes
Korean shotty up the sleeve of my coat
Each slug is like one big egg roll
Impact, you could lose half of your leg, bro
'Cause we don't play those games
Franco hit the deck, click, clack, take aim
Guns never jam, we don't waste rounds
Best shot's behind the ear like chhhk BOW

[Hook: Rich Brian]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do' (yeah)




 [Chorus]
Word on the street, they said that you close to me
Don't like the energy, are we friends or enemies?
Stay away from my face, man, you give me allergy
You just hate while I phase on another frequency
On so many lists, but still pull up in a Lyft
Lately I'm on my ways, listen what my guy will say
In Airbnb's, got one hundred-thousand keys
But you know where I stay, don't let me catch a case

[Verse 1]
On my way to the bank, got more checks
Last night she fucked me way too hard
I'm 'bout to crack my vertebrae, I do more than what I say
You just talk but when time comes you really can't locate
I been back on my bullshit, tell your bitch to suck my dick
You remind me of what I don't wanna be
Be the worst, be the name in case you start an agency
My dad is a lawyer, he would tell me 'bout his days at work
That one time he thought his partner tried to get him fuckin' murked
Last time that I saw you, I gave you a lesson to be learned
Sit down do your homework, I'ma count my blessings like a clerk

[Chorus]
Word on the street, they said that you close to me
Don't like the energy, are we friends or enemies?
Stay away from my face, man, you give me allergy
You just hate while I phase on another frequency
On so many lists, but still pull up in a Lyft
Lately I'm on my ways, listen what my guy will say
In Airbnb's, got one hundred-thousand keys
But you know where I stay, don't let me catch a case

[Verse 2]
Reppin' red and white so hard I barely can control it
I don't care 'bout relevance, I write my bars then I go drop it
Poppin' mollies not important, on the uppers, I'm in heaven
Ready for the revelation and the best for all my bretherens, aye
Eatin' on that Frito-Lay, give a fuck what they gon' say
Girl from Hawaii told me that her name was Lilo, ayy
And that pussy bald, look like it just got a chemo, ayy
Damn, that wasn't cool, honey mustard's got a better taste
I do know what you want, I'm gon' never give it up
I can make you disappear for just a couple hundred bucks
Tryna play me, good luck, young and sharp just like a cut
Get your extras like the first time in the club

[Chorus]
Word on the street, they said that you close to me
Don't like the energy, are we friends or enemies?
Stay away from my face, man, you give me allergy
You just hate while I phase on another frequency
On so many lists, but still pull up in a Lyft
Lately I'm on my ways, listen what my guy will say
In Airbnb's, got one hundred-thousand keys
But you know where I stay, don't let me catch a case




 [Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, now I see that everybody start to fuck with me
'Cause they feelin' like I'm finna go down as a OG
Flame lowkey on the top of their dictionaries talkin' down on me
And I always say, "Guess we'll see"
Guarantee that you're always finna think I'm on speed
Sound a little trippy, think I'm on LSD, 14 when I started doing it
Home school kid never knew he was a prodigy, aye
Get back on the track, with the crack stack
Pilin' in my wallet, gettin' fat like a shake shack
Pictures on my Snapchat, that's all I got about last night
All I know is she was goddamn tight (aye)
Went to America, shit is feelin' biblical
All my life I only saw it on the digital
Said, "I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po"
On the visa so I can't be smokin' indica

[Chorus]
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life,  all I see is red and white
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white

[Verse 2]
Landed in Chicago, met the customs
Mean muggin' mothafuckers let me tell ya something
And I almost got deported back to the home town
'Cause I didn't know what road my hotel's on
Then I met my manager, Sean 88 chillin' in the passenger
And I'm feelin' tripped out, seein' him for the first time
Worked overseas for a year, that's a long run (88)
Now I'm finally here
What now? What to do next? I don't care
Every single day feel like I'm on a mission
Workin' with Pharrell on my first damn session
Never had to write in a room with nobody
Feelin' under pressure, man this dude made "Happy"
Wrote a couple bars while chuggin' on a Red Bull
Then all of a sudden, all my worries turn into vapors ayy

[Chorus]
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white




 [Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers (yuh)

[Post-Chorus]
I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

[Verse 1]
Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Verse 2]
All these parties I attend
But never know the celebration
I let you do what you want
No need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin' 'bout the things that you pursue

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

[Verse 3: Rich Chigga]
Uh, ayy, yuh
Born in '99 and I got 99 chicks in my crib (ayy, what?)
X got out the Pen, I knew about it from his fuckin' team (ayy)
Only make this shit then when you listen, you gon' fuckin' quit
Not from Florida but they like, "He go hard, he just a jit" (buh, ayy)
On my dick, ayy, why you on my dick?
Swear, last week, you wasn't fuckin' with me
Now you tryna click (ayy)
Wait, bitch, please do not make me wait
I fly over to your state (ayy)
Don't be lyin' like the mothafuckin' cake, uh (ayy)
20/20 vision, still not fuckin' with it
Every move I make, I do with precision
Everybody tryna get on a song
But what is the purpose when I'm not the feature?
Woah, tryna be the GOAT but I just see them walkin' by my door
Make the country proud, I got the governor wearin' all my clothes




 [Hook]
Bitch, hold my strap
He don't wanna see me snap
Tryna front on me then see
Who be the quickest to get capped hoe
Rich is my name
Cause I'm stackin' like Cobain
Smokin' on that shit bitch
I'm just gettin' used to all this fame

[Verse 1]
Bitch you claiming you a savage
But you really just a sad bitch
I don't wanna talk with you
We see that you is lame bitch
Thinkin' that you dope
You nothin' like that shit you slang bitch
Catch you in these streets
And imma pop yo ass on day bitch

All these homeboys looking like a farmer
All these cloutboys all rock designer
None of these lames tryna catch that come up
Bitch don't start shit unless you got your body armor

I don't hit the gym
But I still be tryna flex
Pull up with the mechs
Lookin' like you owe me cash

[Hook]
Bitch, hold my strap
He don't wanna see me snap
Tryna front on me then see
Who be the quickest to get capped hoe
Rich is my name
Cause I'm stackin' like Cobain
Smokin' on that shit bitch
I'm just gettin' used to all this fame

[Verse 2]
50 clip
I don't see nobody tryna hit that lick, I'm 'bout that shit
You can't tell me nothing, you a goddamn bitch
Whip a freak, suckin' dick
You better take yo fuckin' pick
Going on these airplanes every minute
Got me fuckin' sick

Yo bitch, she sucking up like Kirby
Wondered if she pink inside
And if she hairy like some Furby hoe

You say you fresh but boy you rotten
Lookin' like some damn tomatoes
Shut yo mouth or get that [?]

[Hook]
Bitch, hold my strap
He don't wanna see me snap
Tryna front on me then see
Who be the quickest to get capped hoe
Rich is my name
Cause I'm stackin' like Cobain
Smokin' on that shit bitch
I'm just gettin' used to all this fame




 [Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just wanna know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Sittin' in my crib thinkin' 'bout shit
That I never done, but I wish I did
Actin' like I'm fine, but I'm losin' it
Coulda kissed that girl, but it ain't relevant
Coulda made that move, I'm regrettin' it
Feelin' so low, like I'm on 2%
Been livin' life like it's a tournament
Loneliness turned off and now it's on again
Tell myself run, ain't no lookin' back
Only time I do is when I'm reachin' for the stack
Back on my old ways, on my old Mac
Thinkin' 'bout my old days, I'll never go back
Fuck that, tryna get myself my own crib
Be an independent man, I might just suck my own dick
Ain't got time, baby just tryna gold dig
Gotta get through all the people that I roll with

[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just wanna know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah, hole in my soul, don't know how to fill it up
Cannot let nobody in, hopin' that they understand
Can't change my ways, since I get through my days
It's just how your boy was raised, vigilant in every way
Every single night I've been stayin' up
My imagination's takin' flight and it's takin' off
And my time is slowly tickin' now, I don't wanna wait anymore
Don't wanna be erased, wanna make a change

[Bridge: Joji & Rich Brian]
Please don't hurt me, I've just lost my way
(My way, my way, my way)
Leave no trace of my misery, get me through the day
Get me through the day (get me through the-)

[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just want to know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride




 [Verse 1]
Let me tell a story 'bout a boy named Brian
This is not a fairy tale, no, that's not what I'm implyin'
This is really not the type rhyme, writing 'bout flexin'
Got some bitches on the phone but I'm really not replyin' type shit
With the clique, and we going out to get ourselves a drink
To the fast lane, might make the pedal fuckin' sink
Bumpin' Lil Wayne, feelin' like we ain't got time to think
Cigarettes, feelin' like we be the kings, got to the party 'bout 11:28
Went up to the bartender askin' for some Bombay
No mixer, straight up, so you know I'm gettin' wasted
Then I realized I ain't even bring my paper
Mike nowhere to be seen, losin' like I'm Charlie Sheen
Lookin' left and right, panickin' 'cause now my glass is clean
Talkin' to the bartender, "Sorry sir, I'm just a teen"
That's when I finally met the girl of my fuckin' dreams

[Chorus]
Ain't no game that I play when it comes to
Gettin' that kitty out the cage for my night, go
Drive to store just to buy a fuckin' mattress
If that can mean she gon' end up on my nitrous

[Verse 2]
Back to the story and now I'm talkin' to this girl
I'ma call her Tracy and she lookin' like dessert
She noticin' that I'm trussin', then she asked me, "What for?"
And I told her everything, and she gave me three fours
She said, "Where you wanna go?" and I told her, "I don't know"
"Do you got a girlfriend? That don't really matter, though"
I'm like, "Oh shit," thinkin' 'bout where this gonna go
So I proceed, man's never did this shit before, aye
Back to her place now, tryna get my thing up
2 AM, whiskey dick, 80% discount
So I had to go down, cruisin' down to poon town
Making sure I put that bitch's frown on upside-down
Gettin' pretty wet, sweat runnin' down her neck
And the kitty so cute, I wanna keep it as a pet
She so clean, man, that pussy smell like honeydew zest
Finally gettin' hard, so you know what's finna happen next

[Chorus]
Ain't no game that I play when it comes to
Gettin' that kitty out the cage for my night, go
Drive to store just to buy a fuckin' mattress
If that can mean she gon' end up on my nitrous

[Verse 3]
Strugglin' to put the Jimmy on, turnin' red, I feel like a chameleon
Then she gettin' on top and your boy just start to feel hysteria
"Bump and Grind" playin' in the stereo when I told her, "It's my first time"
And she told me, "Baby, it's fine, I don't mind"
Then she held my hand and it was intertwined
My god, it was nothin' like what I had in my mind
Now it's time to put it in, baby, now it's primetime
This is where the fun begun
Heard her moan and I'm feeling like I'm 'bout to fuckin' cum
Heard a knock, now your boy's got to go and fuckin' run
Then I made a jump, heard the loudest scream ever
It was from her fuckin' mom, aye
Called Mike on the team, said I need to leave the scene
He done picked me up, told him 'bout the girl that did the deed
Even said her name, then he asked if he could take a peek
Jumped out his fuckin' seat, turns out I fucked his sis




 [Chorus: NIKI]
I got a secret, I gotta keep it
No, I ain't 'bout to jinx it, though
I'ma knock on wood and climb uphill
Lookin' out windows, I'm wishin'
I'm seein' bills, mint condition
No, I ain't gonna tell a soul, I'll just make this real, I'll show ya

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Born in Jakarta, but I live like I'm from Calabasas
Roll seven deep, they make my life feel so much like a movie
I don't really know what I'm watchin' (what I'm watchin')
But I know it's Royce that I'm ridin' (that I'm ridin')
Go 'head and dream, take some melatonin, it 'gon help you sleep
Point it at the target, shoot your shot, while countin' 1, 2, 3
No, this ain't a game that we playin' (that we playin')
This is life and boy you better not go waste it (go waste it)

[Chorus: NIKI]
I got a secret, I gotta keep it
No, I ain't 'bout to jinx it, though
I'ma knock on wood and climb uphill
Lookin' out windows, I'm wishin'
I'm seein' bills, mint condition
No, I ain't gonna tell a soul, I'll just make this real, I'll show ya

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Uh, too lit for my own good, hopin' I'ma make it
My fans, they are doubtin' but that ain't no environment to live in
Ayy, they just walk around with no direction
Think we got a different destination, man
Too dumb to listen, goals already written
Fire in my soul can't hold no composure, I'm goin' off
It's my dream and ain't nobody finna wake me up
Don't wake me up

[Chorus: NIKI & Rich Brian]
I got a secret, I gotta keep it
No, I ain't 'bout to jinx it, though
I'ma knock on wood and climb uphill
Lookin' out windows, I'm wishin' (Look out windows, I'm wishin')
I'm seein' bills, mint condition (I'm seein' bills, mint condition, ayy)
No, I ain't gonna tell a soul, I'll just make this real
Ayy, ayy, I'll show ya
Let's do one more later




 [Intro]
This goes out to people chasin' they dreams
And willing to do whatever the fuck they have to do
No matter how fuckin' big and crazy it is
We can fuckin get it boy

[Verse 1]
Rollin weed with the Backwoods
My life has been so easy on me
Sittin down relaxin' on my front porch in Orange County
I feel so lucky cause I had a dream that I'mma be a famous mothafucka you can't stop me
And here I am sippin' liquor on my way to Bali
And everybody on this plane they lookin' at me funny
They're like "are you Heely from Twitter?" people know me
But my mom still think that I ain't capable of money
Money buys happiness and that's just the truth
But when you rich you take it for granted and let it loose
Fuck tolerance, Indonesia's what I'm reppin'
Started from the bottom, not going back to trappin'
I don't know that many niggas that talk about this shit
I been hearin' from the stories how I don't know how to spit
Started from the bottom, not going back to trappin'
I'm just a youngin' with a dream hope to make it with my team
And I know that's gonna happen it just takes some self-esteem

[Outro]
Yea self-esteem, you gotta love yourself
Self-love comes before anything else
My dream is to go to California when I'm 18
And everything I said in this song has never happened
But I know it will one day, I'm out




 [Chorus]
I done wore a lot of hats
Tell my team "take all my people to the back"
I don't need to flex or tell the people where I'm at
Who I'm with or who I'm seein' later, where I went
All their validation ain't gon' matter in a sec

[Verse]
Throw back to the fake Rolex
Put it on and went into the club like "Where the hoes at?"
'Member sittin' down on my computer bumpin' Kodak
Thinkin' I should probably go delete all of my old tracks
Silly me for thinkin' I should probably done more of that
I like all my women short and sweet like all my old raps, uh
Gotta wait 'til I'm done (ayy)
Don't need no more trash, I got too many where I'm from (ayy)
I done put in work and now I'm havin' all the fun
I just did a tour, I'm ready for another one
I can turn your girl to mine in just a second
Don't get fooled by how I smile 'cause I can get to actin' reckless
I been livin' so good, it's been a while that I've been jealous
Killin' shit is what I say when they ask 'bout my occupation
Got my U.S. Visa on the day before I flew in (ayy)
I don't got too many friends, I just hang with the 88s
Red and white, born and raised, took a flight, to LA
Hang with my, day to day, kiss a chick in the face
Then I put it on her face, we still goin' through this phase
We been fightin' everyday, shit is sad like anime
Never wanted it to be a mess, but you gotta get up out my way
Driving lesson, shoulda told you stay up in your lane
When I'm doin' business, better stay the fuck away
Made me blow up like a microwave
I be makin' sure that I be fuckin' up your day
I don't mind the fans
Showin' love to everybody be the most important thing
I got Andrew with me, and he down to take a stab
Wait for me to walk it, is the word he always say
All these protocols, I'm slowly turnin' to a diva man
I'ma beat the runners ass if he don't got my Chic-Fil-A, aye
Never like to brag, but I do it in my raps
What I'm tryna tell you is

[Chorus]
I done wore a lot of hats
Tell my team "take all my people to the back"
I don't need to flex or tell the people where I'm at
Who I'm with or who I'm seein' later, where I went
All their validation ain't gon matter in a sec




 [Intro]
I ain't really finna' tell y'all how to get away with Murda and shit
Uh


Ride with a couple friends
Live like I'm Kurt Cobain
Tail, then you try again
What can't you understand?
Yeah, we gon' bring the pain
Man, this is all a game
We out here changing lanes
They gotta match our pace




 [Intro]
Ayy

[Chorus]
See me run, see me run
Runnin' 'til my lungs might give
Runnin' for the front, I feel like Usain in this bitch (ayy)
Passin' all these runners, number one is in my list
Blinders on me, I can't even see
See me in my tour bus by myself
Call me selfish 'cause I got me and nobody else
Give myself an envelope just like it's per diem (ayy)
Twenty mirrors in my crib, I'm hangin' with my friends

[Bridge]
Feelin' like I traveled through some time, oh man
Skippin' through some years but it feel right, oh yeah
Gettin' ready for some blessings comin' our way
Forrest, Forrest runnin' for some days

[Verse]
I'll do the shit 'til the credits roll
Already got through the greatest goals
Met with a girl when I went back home (ayy)
She put me in a group chat with that pussy
Talk to it, send emojis to the pussy
Then beat it up 'til it wanna go sue me (ayy)
My brother called me and told me to man up
Told me to be lactose tolerant
Man stop avoidin' that cheddar (ayy)
In love with the Solo cups
I'm on the road and I'm lovin' my bunk
Still missin' home, but I'm havin' my fun, uh
I would never quit, I'm too legit
Indonesian MC Hammer in this bitch
Beat your ass if you correct my grammar in this bitch
I done way too much for you to say my parents' rich (nah)
But I'm tryna make it happen
Makin' green like Geico
All because I'm nice, ho
They know what I like though
Pussy on my rider
Groupies is some psychos
My bedroom is a psych ward
Tell that girl to smile more
I take it on my Leica

[Bridge]
Feelin' like I traveled through some time, oh man
Skippin' through some years but it feel right, oh yeah
Gettin' ready for some blessings comin' our way
Forrest, Forrest runnin' for some days

[Chorus]
See me run, see me run
Runnin' 'til my lungs might give
Runnin' for the front, I feel like Usain in this bitch (ayy)
Passin' all these runners, number one is in my list
Blinders on me, I can't even see
See me in my tour bus by myself
Call me selfish 'cause I got me and nobody else
Give myself an envelope just like it's per diem (ayy)
Twenty mirrors in my crib, I'm hangin' with my friends




 [Verse 1]
Never worry 'bout a single hatin motherfucker
Lookin like my next supper, all these moves that I'm makin got people talkin
Like how many papers is this man signin, I'm back wit the backpack rap
Man I'm thinkin that this shit finna make them scat, got a bag full of cash if we talkin bout that
Run run it like Forrest Gump can you feel that, ay
I'm a renaissance man, if you wanna get a feat you not gon get response man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan
Don't be jealous don't be rude go back to rollin up grams
People think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (damn)

[Hook]
Ballin only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin up that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

[Post-Hook]
Always sayin no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

[Verse 2]
You got cash, buy sum chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
("who the fuck is Zac?" "high school musical")
Bitch hold my stacks I'm 30 minutes late to France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance, better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me thru this day, sippin on Bombay, I dont trust you gotta take this survey
Man I don't look back, never cut no slack, better get way back, fore yo ass get smacked uhh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho, never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow, always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

[Hook]
Ballin only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin up thats just the everyday routine
All my old my friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit em with no vaseline

[Post-Hook]
Always sayin no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie




 [Intro]
Hello, Brian, this is your Grandmother
Um, I don't know if you remember me but
Do you have time to maybe
Meet up and touch base about
You know, talk about life maybe
And catch up you know

[Chorus]
No, no, I don't know, don't be askin' me no more
I just close my door, put the "do not disturb" on
Don't you get too close, you know I'm an animal
Don't want to stay too long, I just get this shit to go
Slo-mo when I move so I do not lose control
Lomo camera every time I fuck your hoe
Airbnb's now, start to feel like second home
She on my dick now, this is just a second song

[Verse 1]
Actin' like a hooligan, I swear I think I'm fuckin' losin' friends
Somebody called me up and told me I'ma meet the president
I said okay then I proceed to leave my friends
And every citizen and everybody where I'm livin', aye-aye
Yes, lawd, bought some Bitcoin, was 'bout to buy some more
She a vegan eatin' seared 'loins, can't commit to love
I ain't Google, I don't give no answers, got the firewall
They keep askin' me about some things that they already know

[Chorus]
No, no, I don't know, don't be askin' me no more
I just close my door, put the the "do not disturb" on
Don't you get too close, you know I'm an animal
Don't want to stay too long, I just get this shit to go
Slo-mo when I move so I do not lose control
Lomo camera every time I fuck your hoe
Airbnb's now, start to feel like second home
She on my dick now, this is just a second song

[Verse 2]
Back in my hometown, got me feeling extra strong
Where I'ma go now, nobody gon' really know
Came with a new sound, just by sitting in my room
Smell hella good now, I been puttin' on perfume
Takin' pictures with the girls, I keep my hits up in my vault
My rhythm still left in the winter, think you gotta wear an extra coat
I'm Tarantino with the shit, directin' music videos
Man, I can sense your cluelessness, don't even interview me, hoe
Hoe, tell your man to go 'cause he been stickin' like some throat coat
I don't like your energy, I skate away like Frozone
You been hearin' things about me and you want to know, know
If it's true or false and then I hit you with the

[Chorus]
No, no, I don't know, don't be askin' me no more
I just close my door, put the "do not disturb" on
Don't you get too close, you know I'm an animal
Don't want to stay too long, I just get this shit to go
Slo-mo when I move so I do not lose control
Lomo camera every time I fuck your hoe
Airbnb's now, start to feel like second home
She on my dick now, this is just a second song




 [Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
They be salty like sodium
I just do my shit and I'm turning up the volume
Fuck a foreign whip, man, the Uber's what I rode in
Yeah, my shit so flames Elon Musk could prolly sell it, amen
A, B, C, D, E, time for your ass to leave
I just need time for me, if you don't, you, we gon' see
1-9-9-9, hide your bitch 'cause I'm here
I've got nowhere to be, 88 be the team

[Verse 1]
Taking on the whole world and we learning quick, uh
While you out here actin' like a mothafuckin' bitch
Can't you see, can't you see? I'm so cold like Febreze
I've been up for two weeks, I feel like countin' sheeps (countin' sheeps)
Doin' numbers like I'm Ed Sheeran
Movin' with my A-team, yeah we staying coherent
Mind so deep, you will prolly die if you go jump in it
Only thing I do is cook some food and mind my own business (yurr)

[Chorus]
They be salty like sodium
I just do my shit and I'm turning up the volume
Fuck a foreign whip, man, the Uber's what I rode in
Yeah, my shit so flames Elon Musk could prolly sell it, amen
A, B, C, D, E, time for your ass to leave
I just need time for me, if you don't, you, we gon' see
1-9-9-9, hide your bitch 'cause I'm here
I've got nowhere to be, 88 be the–

[Verse 2]
I just say the number in my head, then I make it, ayy
I just killed that pussy, send your thoughts and your prayers, ayy
I don't need to see your pasty face, see you later, ayy
Go ahead and tell me 'bout how long you just waited, ayy
She call me papi, she murder my meat
Leave with no warnin', leave when I want it
Intimidate, little bitch, I'll make you vomit
I put a line, when I do you do not cross it
Too high to say nothin' or be normal for a second
I just gotta tell you something, man, this shit gon' last forever
My guys, they don't need no strap to smoke you
They be doin' Muay Thai
Gettin' physical like PE is a subject
Saw a pretty girl, I'm like "Baby, where you from?"
Long brown hair, she got that shit from Amazon

[Chorus]
They be salty like sodium
I just do my shit and I'm turning up the volume
Fuck a foreign whip, man, the Uber's what I rode in
Yeah, my shit so flames Elon Musk could prolly sell it, amen
A, B, C, D, E, time for your ass to leave
I just need time for me, if you don't, you, we gon' see
1-9-9-9, hide your bitch 'cause I'm here
I've got nowhere to be, 88 be the team (yuh)




 [Verse 1]
Yo' bitch on me but you can never do nothing
'Cause yo' momma raised a pussy
Everytime I walk to the drop top, can't help but
Close my eyes 'cause my whip so glossy
God damn, bitch, I don't smoke no gas
I don't pop no Xans,  hella cake
I just need that ass, don't worry 'bout no mans
Look at me, look at he, you don't wanna fuck with we
Hit the streets, roll on me, you gon' end up in the sea

[Bridge 1]
7:30, wake up, skrt up in the lobby then proceed to flee
All my people ridin' in the backseat on a killin' spree
Wait, who that be, ready on the count of 3
Squeeze the G, leave the scene
Bouncin' like the trampoline

[Hook]
Gettin' bread, earn income (man)
Spent it on this Balmain
Working all night I might run into the Batman
I don't see no such thing as a mothe'fuckin' bro, mane
You ain't fuckin' slick if you think you in my team, mane

[Verse 2]
We gon' pull up on the kids with a flat brim cap and the tats get the  brick
And I don't give a fuck hit em with the damn dicks
Man, hold up, pause, now they red like Santa Claus
I'm a G bet there's something wrong with me
All these mans on the ground, lookin like the dead ass sea
Yeah, pull up on me, sip a high-t, till I OD
I don't really give a fuck no more b
Skrrt skrrt onamonapee, bitch Grand Prix
Pull up on a fuckin enemy, 3rd degree
Now imma go right back to the crib (to the crib bitch)
And leave the fuckin country with the brick (loudpack)

[Bridge 2]
I'd call the cops on myself if I can, (if I can)
This shit too crazy need the fuckin ambulance (ambulance)
Don't wear no jackets, I just wear that metal vest (skrrt skrrt)
Got all this money but these bitches unimpressed (yea, yea, yea)

[Hook]
Getting bread earn income (man)
Spend it on this Balmain
Working all night I might run into the Bat(man)
I don't see no such thing as a motherfucking bro mane
You ain't fucking slick if you think you in my team mane

[Bridge 1]
7:30 wake up skrt up in the lobby then proceed to flee
All my people riding in the back seat on a killing spree
Wait, who that be? ready on the count of 3
Squeeze the G, leave the scene
Bouncin like the trampoline
Yeah




 [Snippet]
You'd be the one to end it all and now my heart is shattered
Eatin' less and smoking more is how I spend the day
Check on my phone for texts but I've been tryna stay away
It's hard to see that you're the same girl that I was with
Startin' to think that what we had was just a fuckin' myth
Sorry if you're offended but I'm bein' honest witcha
I'm being selfish and I'm jealous lookin' at your pictures
Your body's not my possession but hope you understand
I fuckin' love you and I miss holding your little hands
Kissin ya cheek you be my sweetest treasure when you blush
Girl, when I'm witcha I be feeling all these types of rush
Old enough to fall in love but young enough to crush
We thought everything was sweet til we're not talkin' much
It's sad that we drifted apart but it was nice enough
To know your soul and take a stroll around your heart and stuff
I hope you still remember me when life is acting up—
