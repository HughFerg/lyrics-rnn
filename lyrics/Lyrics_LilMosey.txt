Says you 'bout a bag, but that my crew shit
And you totin' straps, but you will not use it

I told my young nigga get it, tell them haters pipe down
I'm tryna fuck a hundred bitches in the hotel right now
My niggas came with the drum, we don’t mean percussion
It go ba-dum-bum-bum-bum, ain’t no repercussion
I get dollars, and dollars, no refund
I got bad bitches asking for threesomes
I tell ‘em giddy up, you know they came to have fun
And it ain't about nothin’ unless my niggas get some
Had her going up and down, like a see-saw
Hit it like I’m Swae Lee, bitch i'm T'd off
A hunnid shots, bulletproof like I’m Young Dolph
Shotgun sawed off, pro-pro-problem solved

[Chorus: Lil Mosey, Chris Brown & Both]
Ran in that bitch wit' the Tec, uh huh
Diamonds they drip from my neck, uh huh

Roll up in a Beamer, then I skrt off wit' a Lamb' (Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
I got all these racks, so I'm flexin' 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
Gucci on my feet, and I'm with my nig', JD, yeah
Run around with toolies, got a yoppa on me, ayy
Margiela on his feet, I got Louis on me, uh
I blow all that gas, I be sippin' on the lean (Yeah, yeah, word, word)

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
We smoke gas like the bag, ain't no turnin' down (Down)
Jeans sag, purple rain, crippin' in yo town (Crip)
Players goin' down, ayy, where he stay? I need him now, ayy (Rra)
I call up them Feezies, they gon' smoke him like a ounce (Word, word, word, word, word)
Bitch-bitch I make the trap bounce, what you need? I got that
Nigga tried to rob me, best believe I shot that (That's on my mama)
These niggas ain't killers, they the one that's gettin' shot at (Shot at)
They snitchin' and I copped that, they made me put put top back

[Chorus: Lil Mosey]
Roll up in yo' city, then I hopped out with a flare (With a flare)
My nigga roll with me, if it's beef, then we go blare (Bo, bo,bo, bo)
Roll up in a Beamer, then I skrt off wit' a Lamb' (Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
I got all these racks, so I'm flexin' 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
Gucci on my feet, and I'm with my nig', JD, yeah
Run around with toolies, got a yoppa on me, ayy
Margiela on his feet, I got Louis on me, uh
I blow all that gas, I be sippin' on the lean
