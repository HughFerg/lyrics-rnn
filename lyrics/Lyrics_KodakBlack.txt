[Hook]
Look
Man, I need it right now
Gotta stay 10 toes down
I just gotta stay down
Road running, now I run the town
I ran it up, got it off the ground
Paper chasing I be on wow
Soundbite, they biting my sound
Niggas running off of my style
Gotta stay down

[Verse 1]
Started off with a quarter pound, that's the intro
Now I run the game, blow that money like Nintendo
I am never low
Man I be higher than my tempo
Trip Lee Kodak, I will jump right through your window
Had to stay humble
He murder say black, stay humble
I'm all I can be, bumble
Bakery, fuck pound cake I need a funnel
Tarzan swinging
Yeah, I made it out the jungle
I hustle and I bubble
And yeah I struggle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep from going under
Do it for my momma
6 plus 4
I'm on my ten toes feet planted to the floor
Bitch I used to kick doors
Trying to get this money ain't trying to get no hoes
Once I stack that six, I want six more
Wrist gold
Call the plug tell him ship a shitload
I sit on the stroll and let that shit go
Fuck the fame
I'm writing foreign
Road running I be on the Jordan
And why all these niggas be so concerned about
What I be doing and try to hop on for a pony ride

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rolled up in that Jag
Roly poly
Niggas they pulling me back
But they don't know me
Codeine take the pain away
I might OD
I can't let you win this race
I need the trophy
Nigga wipe that frown off your face
You are an emoji
I'm outchea
20 for a day I'm like Kobe
Phony, get from round me
You niggas bogus
Nah, nah
I never leave that money call me oldie
Put me on stage, don't even show mix
Abracadabra
That work gon' hocus pocus
Took off like NASA
Fresher than Orbit
Show my ass off
Shitting on them, they like toilets
Pulled up in NASCAR
I just rent the Corvette
Boy I'm finna blast off
I let it surface
And she say she like purses
And like splurging
Only spend that money on me
My favorite person
No, I will never purchase
You ain't worth it
Riding like a derby
I can't work it
Flexing on them on purpose
They feelings hurting
911 emergent, I need a surgeon
This urgent
Bleeding concrete no longer virgin
Thank you
(?) like Turkey
My 40 churcking
I can't work it
I just get nervous
And go to bursting

[Outro]
Gotta stay down
Gotta stay down
Niggas running off with my style
Gotta stay down




 I got quality and quantity
So every single day I keep dropping shit
They just piss tested me today, I was positive
Project Baby a product of my environment
They just put a trespassing on me in the 'jects
Them crackers say they don't never want to catch me in the 'jects
What you expect for me to never come by and holler?
Pop a X for my niggas late night popping bottles
Just wanna hit the stu and buy a bottle of some water
Post up on the stroll and hear what I been missing out on
My nigga say he went to rehab but he got right back on flocka
My other nigga popped a C-class then that pussy came up out him
Like it's winter, I be posted like a snowman but it's autumn
In elementary I wanted to be a G, I dreamed it back in Markham
Momma I regret I was always your little problem
Young nigga I'm the husband of the house and I'm the father
Brother John Wicks, he would rob them, tell me nothing 'bout it
My brother was robbing, popping tops but he wouldn't never tell me 'bout it
(Why didn't you pay for this beat though?)
What you mean why I ain't pay for this beat? 'Cause I'm a motherfucking robber
I was in Fort Myers, I was 15 and I was serving Demi Lovato
I tried to shoot him, he had that woo on him I turned into a monster
I told my brother what happened to my revolver
I was so mad, I asked my brother what the hell happened to my revolver
My hammer broke, ain't never seen this shit before
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
I was creeping, I was scheming on that nigga on the low
I promise ain't nobody see me that whole weekend in the 'No
The world cold I put that heater on em though
I wasn't stressing but I wanted to relieve it on the [?]
My hammer broke I'd never seen this shit before
If I was him I would have beat me to the floor
Then that nigga started creeping very slow
That nigga he started leaving very slow
Started skipping, getting away like it's hilar-ious
Yeah he protected but you still scared of me
I was just 14 years old, I'm on methamphetamine
Y'all was just sitting around smoking weed and watching Netflix
Everyday I wanted to do something hot, in the stolo for no reason
Parked it in a vacant spot and they towed 'cause it left it parked right in my neighbor lot
Aye, I put that burner on that nigga
Told him if he make one more move he getting popped
I dare you nigga take one more step you getting stretched out
I customized the 38, it got a drum like I'm [?]
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
Cross my window roadrunning, got this rental here from Hertz
I'm conditioned, trained myself to stay authentic and be pure
In the back of the black cat make that kitty purr
Everything I rap about, these streets'll vouch for me I'm sure
Clothesline in my backyard, no new white tee, rewash dingy shirt

Nigga I be gettin' to the cake, I love that pastry

Out here livin' on my own like I'm 18

It's the fuckin' kid and my bitch Colombian

I need your check, I need they check
I keep that magnum, I ain't talkin' safe sex
You been workin' all your life, you ain't get paid yet
You been on your way forever, you ain't came yet
18 double 0, 18 double 0, 18 double 0
Bring it to your door, just like Domino
Boy your money low, (Got Bills like buffalo)
Boy your money low
18 double 0, 18 double 0, 18 double 0

[Hook]
I'm on 18, always on 18

 [Intro]
This shit crazy, dog
My young bull was just with me last night
I shifted, dog, he got caught up
And the vehicle he was in had all my raps that I wrote when I was locked up a couple bids, you know?
1800 nights

[Verse 1]
I was just thinkin' 'bout family
Thinkin' 'bout Pop Hendley them
Don't say you love me if you don't mean that shit
And I'm thuggin' hard 'cause I mean that shit
I was just thinkin' 'bout my family
They been feelin' like I abandoned them
Why the fuck am I walking around here with a Glock for?
Nigga livin' dirty so I gotta keep the mop on me
Got a street sweeper, but I still keep the mop though
I put everything I got on
I ain't seen my brother in a week
I put too much time in the streets
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma don't worry 'bout me
All you gotta do is love King
I hope y'all see what I be thinkin' 'bout
I'm smilin'
I just smile just to cope now
But I'm wildin'
I swear to God I'm tryin'
I'm tryna slow down
My people tellin' me to slow down
I fell in love with the fourth pound
You would think I'm with the Zoe Pound
Shoutout to ATL
But where I'm from we won't say "12"
We say "Tro-down"
The raiders out there just rolled around
All my niggas gettin' rico
All my niggas gettin' rico
He ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
Promise he ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
He ain't gon' tell ya if he know
If you 'round me
I promise if you 'round me, he's Zoe
He a zombie, he Zoe
A zombie on earth, I'ma Zoe
I brought hell on earth for these hoes
You my heaven on earth, you my hoe, baby
You my old lady
All them hoes hatin'
Well fuck what them hoes say
We rockin' Gucci with Dolce
Love my ol' girl, love my old lady
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm thinkin'
But I don't pop molly
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm sayin'
My chauffeur don't like speedin'
I like the Tesla better when it drive me
I can sit back on IG
I ain't gotta look up when the light green
I'm on the i- on autopilot, my bitch ridin' me
Cruise control
I thank the lord I ain't lose my soul
1800 nights I done sacrificed
Triple cross like Jesus Christ

[Verse 2]
You ain't understand me I'ma tell you twice
I'm ugly corner, even when I die
I'm wonderin' if you love me like I
I'm wonderin' if you thuggin' like how I be
Head first, is he runnin' right behind me?
Nah, fuck that, you better be runnin' right beside me
It's like everything that I touch, it just be fallin' apart
I can't leave my past behind me
I wanna know what's goin' on in the projects
I wanna slide and go see what it look like
Remember Pop hit a lick on a four wheeler
E Murder, almost lost his life on a dirt bike
I seen a cracker to my left so I turned right
I lost my re-up money tryna shoot dice
My niggas leavin' niggas stank for some hood rank
You ain't got no street cred, ain't got no Woo stripes
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas and my family
They the only ones that understand me
Pop the clutch, fishtail on the banshee
The Devil sent me a blessing
My dreads like devil horns, they don't know that I be on my damn knees
Forgive me lord, forgive me lord that I fell for it
Forgive me lord that I fell short
I'm dressin', playin' in the airport
Bust a nigga brain if you care for it
Young nigga what would you do for it
Her boyfriend smokin' Newports
Just put my baby momma in a new foreign
'Bout to write a book, no Dr. Seuss, boy
I got stories like a news reporter
Like a book, put my momma in two stories
I'm postin' in the hood 'cause the school borin'
I'm smokin' Cherry Pie, I don't smoke Spice
I would never tell you about my old life
Sniper biker
Pop a wheelie on the Raptor
I got snakes in my closet, I'm a rattler
And I keep body bags for a rapper
Hidin' from my past, got me runnin' from a cracker
Lil' Kodak they just wanna see you captured
I'm snappin' and I'm flashin' like a camera
You don't know the meaning behind it
You don't know the reason I'm like this
Sincerely me
I'm feelin' this beat
To all my niggas in prison, if you listenin' right now, I miss you

 [Intro]
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse 1]
I hope you ain't nothing like my old friends
Or any other women that I had
I know I'm better than your ex-boyfriend
Or any other niggas from the past
Can I take you where I learned the game from?
Show you why I act the way I act
Lately, I've been on a fucking marathon
Running to the motherfucking cash
I'm liking how you make a brother laugh
Can I come and get you in a Jag?
Then, hit it in the backseat of the Jag
Baby girl, I know you like my swag

[Hook]
Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Verse 2]
I'm just so excited that I'm free
Sometimes, it be feeling like a dream
Can a young brother get some sleep?
Lately, I've been working over 3
Mama told me, "Son, I never hear from you"
Cook something, you don't even eat
Mama, I'm just trying to make a mil' for you
Put you in a condo on the beach

[Hook]
Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Verse 3]
Why they just can't let a nigga be?
I've been busy, I've been doing me
Have you thinking I've been with the Zoe pound
Me and all my niggas come in deep
On the ground, young ten toes down
I can put a nigga on his feet
I caught the Audi, then I ran the check up
And, I ain't even been out here a week
Got my shooter playing hide and seek
Just in case you niggas try and creep
Everybody wanna be your friend now
Better watch the company you keep
Everybody got they fucking hand out
See you eating now they want a piece
Oh, that's Kodak Black, I've been hearing bout'
He the hottest nigga in the streets
If you love me, love a nigga deep
When you see me, what you really see?
To everybody else, I was a sour guy
But, I be treating you a little sweet
I'm so close to showing her my real side
Show this girl another side of me
I think we've been getting along real fine
You love it when I hit it on the beach
I've been working hard, ain't got no spare time
I can't even party on the week
I'm just trying to see where your head at
When you grow up, what you wanna be?
Run up on a nigga, where the bread at?
I be going ham for the cheese
I just wanna see all of my niggas home
They can't wait to get back on the streets
I just talked to Jackboy on collect phone
He told me he ain't trying to take the plea

[Outro]
For my niggas, I'll swim across the sea




 [Intro]
Baby girl I got 3 dicks
Fuck with me, I got 3 dicks
30 bitches, I got 30 clips

[Hook]
I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops
30 shots in my Glock, 30 golds in my mouth
You can call me leprechaun, throw the gold in the pot
Dish soap in the pot, 30 bands for a drop
Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot
30 down, straight drop, dirty tan, get rocked
Love the way that 30 pop, Stephen Curry with the shot
16 I open shop, then the people kicked us out

[Verse 1]
I ain’t with that shit, I swear to god
I’m on that shit, I swear to god
And really this a 40
But my 40 hold 30
Met a cougar bitch, she 30
She heard a nigga putting that work in
Ho I’m just sliding, I ain’t serving
I be gliding, I be swerving

[Pre-Hook]
Keep these niggas out my face, so concerning
I be sniping and deserting
Skrt skrt, I be leaning when I’m turning
All my pieces working, got me splurging

[Hook]
I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops

Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot
30 down, straight drop, dirty tan, get rocked
Love the way that 30 pop, Stephen Curry with the shot
16 I open shop, then the people kicked us out

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to my grandpa, he had 30 jits
I’m not a killer, but where the beat? I wanna murder it
This a drought, it ain’t no work, this shit been working bih
So I’m lurkin’ bih, I’m ‘bout to go on a burglary
Them people playing at my bank, they think I’m doing scams
Nigga drop the 28, he lost seven grams
Blackin’ P’s every day like I'm Will.i.am
Heard you niggas was looking for me well here I am!

[Pre-Hook]
Keep these niggas out my face, so concerning
I be sniping and deserting
Skrt skrt, I be leaning when I’m turning
All my pieces working, got me splurging

[Hook]
I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops

 [Talking]
See there's pussy niggas everywhere
Gutter niggas everywhere
You niggas buy that shit or whatever
Yall already know niggas about they issue

[Verse]
I was fucking with you strong, what's the issue?
What you wanted? A lil song or a picture?
You say somebody hit your phone like it's pressure
So we'll just fuck it dog, I thought that we was better
What you wanted? A lil shoutout, a lil publicity?
If you asked me i would've did it with no resistance
You made a dis song and now you in your feelings
Running around telling niggas, they wouldn't listen
Yea you niggas bout that life, but we more realer
Everytime you pull a play, we pull one bigger
Yea you niggas bout that too, but we some lunatics
Man you niggas should've thought before you do the shit
Tried to shoot a video on my corner but we shoot the shit
If you a bitch now tell the media that you a bitch
I don't tweet, I tell that nigga pull up bring some food
All my zombies in the projects will devour you
And it's easy to keep the tool but you don't know how to move
And you niggas ain't strategic, and you moving loose
My nigga caught him at the wrong time with the .22
Go this a .22
I ain't specifically talkin bout you Heffer
You niggas ain't got no balls, ain't got no testicles
You niggas pussy, ain't got no balls ain't got no pelvis
Cuz if you was a man you wouldn't be jealous
Yall done brought it to a whole other level
Niggas getting kidnapped and getting let go
Niggas only did that just to scare you
To tell the truth if I was there you would've been dead bro
And I feel like it's a blessing I'm on house arrest bro
Cuz you niggas already know a nigga hit first
My cousin just got hit up and it fucked my head up
I was ready to rock and roll, come find my heavy metal
I ask my people "why you move my gun when I went to jail for?"
This house arrest might be a blessing, might be better
What the hell happened to that 187
On another note you niggas should've know better
Niggas know we ain't the niggas to be fucked with
But you niggas out here smoking on that fuck shit
Oh you know we them niggas from the project
Oh you know we them niggas we them zombies
And you know we them niggas boy we about it
And you niggas gookin' right now smokin mollies
If yall wasn't smoking mollies y'all would know the deal
How you going against the will
And I don't call deuces, I call .30s
And I can't believe Bushawn that nigga dirty
Yea you bout that shit you live it but you workin
I don't care what you did I tell a nigga you workin
I keep having visions about these niggas getting wet up
How the hell you can't tell me bout the set up?
And I don't cop no pleas unless I'm jammed up
The only way you talk to me is about some cheddar
I'm swimming in the pool with my beretta
I been learning moves dancing with the devil
Damn I heard you ain't wanna let the Draco spray
Why the hell you even got it anyway?
I don't even know why niggas gotta be
You should've came with bloods you just wannabe
How you rhyme with a nigga who stripped you out your jeans?
Man I ain't forgivin a nigga who had you on your knees

[Verse-YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Everybody under disguise man they scheming
These hoes will set you up
Tell you they love you they don't mean it
Full of syrup, bitch I'm leaning
Smoking dope with the demon
Send my younging at your little nigga give me a reason
I heard a nigga say they turned me up, get off a nigga dick
Don't like the fact that now I'm blowing up, nigga get on your shit
I got turned on next Montana ain't nobody give me shit
Bitch I bought my own car, started my own dealership
Cruising down Florida with my burner leaning faded
To tell the truth, I don't know why these niggas hating
I stay with the 38, I won't let nobody take me
& I know these niggas plotting, so I don't smile up in they faces




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Kodak, Kodak Black
Don't act like you don't know

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Me and momo riding in the Chevy
Say my neck about to break my chain too heavy
Rebirth of Lou Scott Makavelli (ooo purp)
Born stacking bread like the deli (I've been rich)
So you can take it where you want
I'm kamikaze wanna try me? Suggest you dont
Oh, I told you boy, I'm riding the donk
Oh, I got shooters posted by my door
I'm from the Noy, yeah I stay Polo to the floor
Oh, my money long, I cut my homies short
From Golden Acres, what it is, it really ain't
I'm lyrical and what I be saying gon' make you think
I'm all in, I be solo, don't need no friends
I fuck with Lil Soto, that's my cuh-in-law, he get it in
Lil Jackboy, he just wrote me, that nigga he like my kin
I be up all night on M's, I don't fuck around with no Xans
Super charged, I'ma hit the game like a ram
You niggas lame with a lil fame on Instagram
I do my thing, I'm about to make you niggas flame
Ain't holding back no more, I'm finna make you feel my rage
Nigga please? Nigga what? Nigga who?
You running your mouth, your lips bigger than your shoe
Me and my pocket monster, us two, that's my crew
E-Pimp, that's my blood, that's my thug, he bring it through
Oh, I'm about to make you niggas feel it
Murder charge, fresh to death, I'ma make a killing
Oh, I can turn your state into a city
I'm a CEO, I can turn a Drake into a Diddy
Oh, bout to hit you niggas where it hurt
Why you go so hard? Why they put Wayne head all on my shirt?
I'm riding on 26 plus 4's, free Lil Turk
He just caught 30, that shit'll make me go berserk
Punchline, I hit the beat with a jab
The difference between me and you, I pull up in a Jag
Fingers inching like a rash, fiending for that cash
They say "Kodak living good but all his bitches bad"
I ball so hard, my homie fouled 'em, my cast on
I rob so much, I'm in the booth with my mask on
Oh, I'm riding in the coupe, I'm the truth
That money running, I'm outchea chasing it, how about you?
You should get on a track and chase it too
I can turn a lake into a pool
My diamonds shining, why your ice look like it's blue?
While you out here lame vibing, you should be out here grinding too
They say time is money, I'm showing what timing do
Say grind turn into shine, I'm showing what grinding do
Lil Kodak Black, I'm the truth
Project baby, I'm the truth

[Verse 2: One Grand]
You ever get the feeling that time is now to make a killing?
But you the only one that's standing round here with a vision
Everybody knows somebody, knows somebody, knows somebody different
That's what I'm tryna tell my people but my people don't wanna listen
We was brought up in a city where niggas, they hate on niggas
Bitches, they hate on bitches, and all of us is on assisted
Ain't watching my neighbor's paper cause that ain't none of my business
Niggas can't get it in cause they worrying bout how I'm living
Me, I'm my competition
Me, hit me on a mission
Me, I gotta get me, so I'ma make me be consistent
Fuck it, I'm all in, ain't doubting God's plans
Not on tour but I know they get easy in the end
23, I'm the man, I'm the fucking bird nigga
I done seen more chickens than Kentucky Fried Chicken
Ain't falsifying facts, ask a nigga in my city who the first one to get 'em, to get down with them triggers
I am only one man but a different kind of nigga
Left the game without a stain like a fucking place kicker
Anything, any lane, any time I'ma get it
Put my all in it, when it's empty fall in it, fill it
Go hard from the start, from the start to the finish
Done it all, college ball, worked a job, ran a business
Broke the law, broke a heart, broke my foot up in some niggas
Stab me up and shoot me down, but you can't knock me off my pivot

[Verse 3: Koly P]
I'm a reaper, don't be hollering bout your people
I got a stick, it's a fuck nigga beater
Fucked the bitch cause I don't really need her
I'm on point like I'm blowing on keisha
I get cheese like I'm going on pizza
White girl, Ricki Lake, Mona Lisa
Nigga go and get your people then
Ain't nothing, ain't tripping, we can spend a band
Yeah, niggas getting crossed every day
I was taught every dog got his day
When them bullets go to spark and the dog gotta lay
Better hope to God he don't jump with the K
Mr. (?), by the park they'll break
When you getting money, fuck niggas gon' hate
Only real can relate
Four years in the state
And I seen niggas break
Better watch your mouth nigga, jumping on your case
Niggas in disguise, they deciding off of hate
Chain gang now dying bout the case
Know some niggas lying locked behind gates
Surrounded by them snakes
They be all up in your face and
Tryna talk the fire and crack on statements
Don't pen the affidavit
Man I shouldn't have to say this

[Outro: One Grand]
4th quarter and we down by two
You gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter, 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter, 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
Gatorade on the coach




 [Intro]
Project Baby, I am him
Lil Kodak
Well I got 5

[Verse]
I put 5 on it, put my life on the line on it
Watch this, watch how I put my time on it
See, I'm that lil' nigga from the Sandlot
Blood in and out, like a tampon
Hood niggas forget the goal is to make it out
I been here forever, I'm tired of this dang spot
I was built to still grind when the rain drop
I still see them dark skies when the rain stop
And I was on the block 'till the daylight
Hit the [?] off his whip
Now I'm on the same bike
It's Lil Black on a stroll, all this damn white
Mosquitos, they eat me up, I start a campfire
I was 13, I met Ray
I was rackin' up the gold, I was seein' him every day
I was gettin' real greedy, now I'm shackled in them chains
Knew I had to pay the price, but I ain't really want to pay
What I'm doin' wasn't right but I ain't really want to pray
'Cuz I get down and close my eyes and I ain't be knowing what to say
Told me, "Stay in school", I'm not confused that just ain't what I wanted
I'd rather jump on all these beats, look what I do on 'em
First I cut back 3 and put 2 on it
Dj [?] Turned to murder, made the news on 'em
I was jammed, not knowin' what he gon' do
Week later, he in my room, I feel like putting my blues to him
Lil Dj was always my lil goon, but he told me that it's my fault
'Cuz I taught the rules to him
He had my pistol, dang, ain't know he was gon' shoot sum
Locked down, I had niggas giving they food to him
See, I put 'bout 5 on it, but I really had 10
Now I got 5 more
Jackboy wrote me, said he gon' be out shortly
Wrote me again, sayin' he got 9 more
Yeah, I be tryin' to catch my dreams with the lights on
Niggas schemin', so I ain't sleepin' with my eyes closed
Nigga I'm livin', what I live for I die for
I could walk around my projects blindfolded
Now I'm in the stolo, me and Lil Sodo
I had 5, I put 1 on it now I got 4 more
I'm that type of youngin', I be runnin' with the pistol
I be with the older niggas, I ain't runnin' with no Jits
See, they be dead broke, they be lookin' for a fix
While they was running 'round in a ditch, I was runnin' off with the sticks
I was at CL, 8th grade, me and PL
E Pimp told me pass him half a molly, on the DL
I was looking for a sign, I couldn't really see well
Then I'm lookin' for a plug, numbers low, retail
Had to switch my grind, 'cuz these crackers know my detail
Life's a beach
Pistol to yo' ear like a seashell
They ain't really know I was finessin'
Puttin' 4 on it
I was on codine, on that [?]
Movin' slow on it
Money comin', bustin' dick hard, I got yo' ho on it
You givin' me rides, and you ain't know I got my pistol on me
All my niggas criss cross, cross crissin' on me
Switchin' on me, lost and found, they went missin' on me
Was on my team, substitutin', went to pitchin' on me
But no, I ain't trippin' homie
I'm gone be the one, I knew that since I was 'bout 1
They think all my life I'm gon' be runnin' with the pump
Been focused on music, but don't think I won't hit you up, funny
Crack yo' egg, top yolky like Humpty Dumpy
I used to re-up on the ounce and sit right on the ugly
Jumpin' in cars, just wait for you to leave yo' shit runnin'
Hit all day, poppin' chains, crackers lookin' for me
Project Baby, robbin', y'all was watchin' Teletubbies
Fuck it, I'ma put the whole fuckin' 5 on it
Maybach need to come and let me sign on it
Hit the game and bring a whole 'nother sound on it
Rock yo' clothing line and being a whole 'nother style on it
I'm on a whole 'nother vibe homie, and I ain't lyin' homie
First I cut back 1 and I put the whole 5 on it

[Outro]
Kodak
Project Baby, man I told y'all I was gonna do it

Glee! Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm in London, got my beat from London

[Hook]
Every time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat
Somebody call the vet, my dog turned out to be a rat
I'ma slick pimp, got a sixth sense
Ho, you ain't a dime, you just six cents
I be on them beans, she be on codeine
All I want is money, all she want is me
She just wanna be loved, she just wanna be pleased
All I want is money, all she want is me
(All I want is money, all she want is me)
(All I want is money, all she want is me)

[Verse 1]
Say I'm so selfish, all I think about is fetty
I can't settle down, somethin' just won't let me
I want to settle down, well maybe I ain't ready
Bae, I'm livin' reckless, and I'm thuggin' heavy
In love with the skreets, and I'm in too deep
I be tryna leave, it keep control of me
It got my heart, got my mind, it got my physique
She wanna wake up with my wand and put that ass to sleep
I don't bleed Kool-Aid, baby, I bleed concrete
I ask God to give me wisdom, help me spot a leech
I be talkin' money, tell that ho; "kapeesh"
Tell that ho to sheesh, love is for the weak

[Hook]
Every time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat

(All I want is money, all she want is me)
(All I want is money, all she want is me)

[Verse 2]
I'm ziggied up, 26, 13, 6
I'm a seven figure nigga, remember when I had six
I'm a seven figure nigga, remember I ain't have shit
Even though I'm rich, can't forget that I was hittin' licks
All I want is that, all she want is this
I just wanna hit, but I just wanna hit
What be on your mind when it come to this?
Why you close your eyes every time we kiss?
I'ma keep it pimpin', I'ma keep on livin'
And keep on catchin' flights
And never catchin' feelin's
I'ma keep it simple, I'ma keep poppin' flo-rhythm
I like when I'm with ya
But I love gettin' scrilla

[Hook]
Every time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat

 [Intro]
Kodak Black, Kill Bill
Yeah I kill for the bill, steal for that bill
It get real for the bill, yeah

[Verse]
I was riding for these niggas 'fore they rode for they selves
Cause they know I'm that lil zoe who can go and I don't care
Ain't recording no more songs in the year
My nigga died and I ain't even shed a tear
My nigga died to tell you the truth I ain't even care
I got some shit to say so call the engineer
You niggas be saying anything, you feel my pain through your ear
I don't wanna hear that beat if I can't speak on how I feel
My trigger finger itching got me busting in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting hoes in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting hoes in my crib
I was a ghetto child, wanted to be down with my peers
What I'm rapping about the streets would vouch for me for real
I'm wild but I ain't doing no more wildin' gotta chill
Sorry I already made my mind up for real
Lowkey I be vibin' cause my family need me here
But god I gotta keep the fire on conceal
Yeah but I'm wiser now but I ain't drinking beer
Ain't running in Verizon nigga I was just a kid
My mama she accepted what it is
But I know my mama hate the way I live
But everyday we thankful for this shit
Say mama we gotta be thankful for this shit
Know I'm the reason for all the pain I make you sip
Why the hell you ain't wash your fingers with me yet
Nigga when I was a baby I was a man
Then I probably would have went crazy if I was him
Okay I ain't gonna keep talking about my mama
Everybody round me got a body or they wanna
Everybody round me caught a body or they gonna
Nigga would you rather go in or you go under
I was riding for these niggas before they rode for they selves
Plus they know that lil zoe he gone go and he don't care
You can't tell me nothing, I'm clutching on Glock 27
You can't walk up on me I don't want you standing in my square
Ain't paranoid nigga I'm sensitive about my square
My dog be smoking Black & Mild told my niggas that's lame as hell
You smoking Black & Milds smoking square
That shit for squares
Niggas ain't even riding for they self
Nigga I'm finna slide in by myself
Ain't gone tell you how I do it cause I'ma do it by myself
When I'm in my death bed gotta be snoozing on myself
When I lost nigga I was losing by myself
So damn right I'm in my new whip and I'm cruising by myself
Y'all don't love this beat stop this music man I swear
You don't stop this music I'm gone keep killing it I swear
And I'm saying anything that comes to my brain cells
Feed my niggas locked up in the main jail
Fighting cases nigga facing PBL
Eating PB and J everyday waiting on some mail
I'm freestyling when I'm vibing so don't stop me I don't care
My nigga tried to send me a kite I swear to god he got his mail
First forty-eight my nigga told on himself
At school telling everybody the news before they rang the bell

[Outro]
Hey let me just stop right here you namsayin', my nigga told me I got the game in a headlock and shit right now, so let me let it go before they suffocate to death. I'ma let the beat breath a little bit, goddamn I ain't give that bitch no room, no space, no air
Glee




 [Intro]
I fell in love with my bih from the field, baby
Said she from Miami, from the crib, baby
Yeah, when the link up and they ask me questions
You ever killed somebody before? (hahaha)

[Verse 1]
I don't play like that, you talkin' weird lately
Everybody 'round me actin' weird lately
I just want for you to keep it real, baby
I ain't let them know I had a mil, you crazy
Dressin' like I'm poor, I'm rockin' Timbs on the daily
All the record labels know the deals that I'm makin'
Coulda bought a Wraith, I bought a silver Mercedes
My head on a swivel, but your brain on the pavement
Remember hittin' licks and hidin' [in a filthy?] basement
Talkin' to myself 'cause I understand what I'm sayin'
You ain't finna trip me out my mind, no more, Satan
You the reason that I'm Sniper Gang, and I'm shady
Walk up in the studio, bitch recordin' 'cause I'm ready
My bitch, she Dominican Republic, but I'm Haitian
I ain't quit the shufflin' in my feet, now I'm patient
Momma, look at me, mom, look at me, I been changin'
HBK, heartbreak kid, Heart Break Kodak
Remember when I laid there on the counter, seen you naked
Remember when I loved you, now I don't care who see you naked now
Remember when I loved you, now I don't care who see you naked
I came from the projects, Section 8, now I made it
Shit ain't never been the same, I wished I wasn't famous
But, Kodak, don't you give up, don't you quit like that lame did
Don't quit like them lames did
Kodak, don't you give up, don't you quit like that wanksta
Kodak, you better not go out like no lame 'cause you a gangster
Everybody actin' like some hoes all a sudden
Momma called me a dog, but I ain't no hoe 'cause I ain't buggin'
In the field chasin' all my goals, I ain't puntin'
OG Kush got me with a odor, got me musky
Promise everybody 'round me known me since a youngin'
I be with my niggas they my brothers and my cousins
She so goddamn freaky stuck a bean in her booty hole
Money got me drunk, it got me peein' in the studio
Sometimes I don't know if I be goin' or I be comin'
Crack a nigga head like Humpty Dumpty

[Verse 2]
Everybody been actin' weird lately
I just want for you to keep it real, baby
I been had a couple mil, I ain't never say shit
I ain't never say shit
I'm codeine dreamin' in a spaceship
All the pain motivatin' me to stay real
Sound like a vulture cryin' in the glacier
I'm hotheaded but my chain is
I'm workin' like a slave still
And I don't need a Perky for the pain pill
I was sixteen with permanent gold teeth
Snatched 'em out and put diamonds in it
Y'all got the same grill
Everybody fuckin' everybody, we got the same girl
And I be walkin' 'round here like this my dang world
And I be walkin' 'round here like this my dang planet
Think about my family, had to pop a Xanny
Aye, I'm drinkin' liquor, tried to swallow my pride
I hope my son ain't gotta live like I
Mm mm, mm mm
Drinkin' tequila, smokin' sativa
I done made it out the rain, I ain't call FEMA
My baby momma in a Range, took her out the Beam
Ain't never showed no love to me on Valen-Day-Tine
I send words out through the grapevine
Made it out the jungle like I'm godsend
Swing with that vine like I'm Tarzan
I pop a nigga top, don't get your block spint
I ain't goin' out where I be god damnin'
I ain't do the jigga, I'm consumin' liquor
My wrist frame Muller
I don't do Invicta
Fuck a Bentley truck, smile with the Glizzy tucked
In a pickup truck, now I'm smokin' [?]




 [verse 1: kodak]
These hoes ain't shit we bag em and keep it movin'
I ain't see ya round so long where the hell you been?
Zoes in this bihh we ready to get to shootin'
Had my nigga down so long he bout to lose it
And my jaw locking on molly it got me chewin'
Had to take the gun from lil dj cuz he be gookin'
Front my dog a half just to see what he gonna do with it
I be on the road getting to it I be maneuvering
Younging he a fool with that tool that boy a hooligan
I know you ain't clutching for nothing lil nigga use it then
I just have  ménages à trois Just me and two women
Turnt up, fucking all night i got that boot in me

Pull up they like who in it?
She gon pop her punani
Fuck a role model I was looking up to Wally dem
Taught me if a nigga play gangsta lil nigga body dem
I might take a trip back to Brooklyn and fuck with johnny dem
I might buy a whole pound of broccoli & smoke some vitamins
Ahh broke my wrist I'm looking for ibuprofen
How I'm swimming in the money
Should have been a gold fish
First I saw Lil Cool in that water he was floating
He was looking cool in that water so i dove in
First I was snatching chains switching started poking
First lick i hit up the road i made four bands
I don't know him you ain't from the NO man
Nigga i ain't ya friend
I ain't shaking ya hand
I'm just tryna blow man
I don't want that hoe man
I'm just staying focused
I ain't with the romance
They say I'm chosen lil Kodak keep it going
I was posted up all winter like I'm a snow man
They ain't never wanna let me in i kicked the door in
Last nigga dissed me was pussy said he was joking
Oooh 2 door foreign bending corners on em
Leaning moving slow man walking like a old man
I swear my lil nigga need help he stay toting
He quick to give a nigga they mail like he a post man

Girl I don't like the way your booty flop, it's like jello
And now I'm rockin Robin Jeans remember wearing Ecko
She say she just came to chill look bitch this ain't a Getty

Me and DJ on the pill we spinning like a ferris wheel
Oh that's Kodak Black who they be talking bout,that's the nigga
First I had to grow to be the man like a caterpillar

He just found a strap now he cut you like it's nothing

Bumped into Lil Wally in the hood, hey cousin

[Hook]
My name is Kodak but you know that already

 [Verse 1]
I grew up lookin' up to niggas that be on the corner
I can't stop cause if I stop then I'ma dissapoint 'em
Niggas hate but I ain't worried, no I ain't worried bout 'em
My only goal is to keep courage and to make it out the bottom
Oh I was raised by the Chinese store
Even though I ain't Chinese though
Right by there is my Y and the corner store
Diamond girls guarantee you see all the hoes

[Hook]
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

[Verse 2]
The only thing I worry bout is how my grandma doin'
I'm doin' good, I'm stayin' healthy, now I'm makin' music
I'm gon' strive to success and I'm gon' try my best
I'm 14 and already thinkin' about death
Damn I was raised by the dead end
Where fake ass niggas always tryna fit in
Ambition
I'm young and ambitious
The dreams that I have, I'ma dream of madlib it
I can not caught no feelin's when no one else feel it
I cannot play my cards with no dealer to deal it
I'm just livin' with patience
Dedication and greatness
How can I be good when the hood so-so my validation?
I wish my grandma was still here to watch me grow up
I wish four clippers still here to watch me blow up
I guess things never go how you want it to
So I don't wanna be the man, I'm goin' to, uh

[Hook]
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to start off your dreams but it's harder to finish
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

[Verse 3]
I was raised by Wale and them
Get on the beat and let it breathe like oxygen
Every time they do things I follow them
But in a while a lil nigga gon' inspire them
Yeah, I even seen real niggas bail
Seen one got these beads reppin' like a Nextel
Same ones hollin' that they won't tell
Now you think you real cause your motherfuckin' phone tell
Swear these niggas think I'm in that stinker than a skunk tail
Swap my phones now my eyes liftin' like a dumbbell
Niggas sell their soul just to get a fuckin' record deal
So tell me how you fuckin' real?
My momma told me do me but just don't never steal
But I do it anywhere just to keep my pockets filled
They say one day I'm just gon' run up in the wrong house
And a nigga gon' come around and blow my brains out
Deadbeat daddy, grandma gone, that's all I know
They like me in the city, called Pompano
Grandpa was a player, he was with another woman
I just look 'em in his eyes and I see me right through him
I swear my throat hurt from tryna swallow my pride
My daddy fuckin' his god-daughter, she just 25
They got 3 kids and there's one just 5
That means he been fuckin' with her since I was 9
I just opened my eyes and let my ears listen
Friends ain't friends, lil nigga pay attention
Swear my only friends J-Crack and Lil Raw
Man we go back like Al Capone and cigars
And I know that some niggas don't want me to succeed
I just look past it keep balanced stay on my two feet
Got to watch my back cause niggas play keeps
My uncle looked at the weed, he ain't even got money to eat
And God damn, I swear my life crazy
Other people peep my swag, now they think I got a gammie
I'ma live my life
Man you never know, I might die tonight
But God with me
And I ain't gon' leave this world on no plain mission
That's my ambition

[Hook]
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

[Outro]
Yeah half my life spent tryna find somethin' to do with the time we got. The time we got is spent tryna find somethin'. And look I heard behind every destined man is a surprised woman, I just gotta stay humble even though I'm hungry. I thought to myself being with no ambition, you ain't livin'




 [Intro]
I'm antisocial, nigga get from round me

[Verse 1]
Boy how much you talkin'?
Fuck it, hit me on my walkie-talkie

Runnin' with my tool like I'm buildin' houses
You wanna run up? Don't do it you won't make it out it
Turn a rock to dead presidents just like a mountain
Two door Audi, Kodak where you go it?
This right here? I got that bitch from what you call it
These hoes thirsty, line 'em up and call 'em a water fountain
Tryna direct for me, send me to the county
Same niggas say they love me, same niggas doubt me

[Hook]
I'm antisocial, get from round me
Tryna hit the top, don't try and down me
Four diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi
I'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee

They wonder how he
Stay designer Down
He from out of town, how the hell he run this town?
He be always flossin', pull up in the 'Rari
Oh my God, I'm sorry
Cracker do you pardon?
Had to jump before I flew, remember I was crawlin'
Took a dose of cough syrup, I ain't even coughin'
And I'm fly like Batman but my jeans Robin
Time is money, waste my time then it's gonna cost 'em
Fresh to death like Houdini jump right out the coffin
Oh, moon walk in 'em, higher than a martian
Gang activity, blood drippin' from my bottles
Fuck a pacifier, lean all in my baby bottle

[Hook]
I'm antisocial, get from round me
Tryna hit the top, don't try and down me
Four diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi
I'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee




 [Hook]
I'm so tired of people telling you i'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time i hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like i'm feeling you more each and everyday
I ain't letting you go don't you run away

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
Its like i'm feeling you more and more everyday
I'm asking god is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake i call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy toes like she balleray
She heard i'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say i'm acting strange
Red bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride


[Hook]
I'm so tired of people telling you i'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same

 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye I don't pour that liquor on the floor, I pour it down the drain
Down the sink for my dawgs who in hell and who in jail to drink
You feel me?
Nah mean, nah sayin'
Nah talm' 'bout

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I ain't gonna lie I ain't never thought it could be like this yea

I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Never thought I could make it out the PJs, I was just robbin' with DJ
Shout out to my niggas who in Hell right now
And to my dawgs who ain't got release dates
I was doin' fraud way in D.C, I was doin' fraud way in Chesapeake
Ain't nobody wonder about my CD, I was breakin' and enterin' B and E
Mama always see me on TV, 'cause I hit the news, I was 15
Now she can see me on VH1, shit ain't a game, this shit ain't fun
To all the kids who look up to me, shit ain't a game, this shit ain't fun
Niggas want beef we serve they lunch, we been on the run like six to eight months

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Kickin' in doors, Me, Moopa, and Lil' Wiz
They just pick my dawg up for attempt
They just pick my dawg up for a murder one
My dawg got killed while I was doin' a bid
We just talked a day before the shit
And he wanted to talk to me again
And now I never know what he wanted to say to me
If I say my dawg in Heaven that would be make believe
I know my grandma made it in Heaven, say a grace for me
Now I'm gettin' all this cake, I could open a bakery

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I ain't gonna lie I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit




 [Chorus]
I'm about to go and see the dentist ("diamonds! diamonds!")
Bout to go out lurkin’ for them benji’s ("hunnids! hunnids!")
In the jag, I’m splurging on you bitches ("skrr, skrr, skrr!")
Fuck a paragraph, they gave my dawg a sentence
Told her mind your fucking business ("mind your damn business!")
He don't know his bitch is in here trickin’
I’ve been catchin’ flights, ain’t catching feelings ("No, No, No!")
I pass her the molly, made her lick it

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told that bitch I really really want her
I-It took me so long to get her number ("so much time")
I told her please be with me, Imma cuff her ("please be mine")
I got her I just fucked her then I dumped her ("I fucking lied")
I'm the shit, call the motherfuckin’ plumber
I'm a motherfucker, I will fuck yo momma
40 on me, I ain't got no time to rumble
A-all these pieces I can make my own puzzle

I’m from 18th street, I blow you like a bubble ("I will blow you up")
I don’t take no shit, I get that from my momma
I won’t take your shit, I get that from the struggle
Hit that bitch and kicked her out, cause I don’t cut up

[Chorus]
I'm about to go and see the dentist ("diamonds! diamonds!")
Bout to go out lurkin’ for them benji’s ("hunnids! hunnids!")
In the jag, I’m splurging on you bitches ("skrr, skrr, skrr!")
Fuck a paragraph, they gave my dawg a sentence
Told her mind your fucking business ("mind your damn business!")
He don't know his bitch is in here trickin’
I’ve been catchin’ flights, ain’t catching feelings ("No, No, No!")
I pass her the molly, made her lick it

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
H-Homerun, I knocked it out the park (“Swing, Batter-Batter!”)
I left the deck, I hit the front like Rosa Parks
I won’t catch no feelings, I’d rather catch a charge
I ain’t goin’ home, I be goin’ hard
I told her go home, I kicked her out my car
I love my down for, them junkies go bizarre
Polo on me, horses jumpin out the barn (Yeehaw!)
Promise I ain’t never slippin', I am armed (“No, not I”)
I took his pot of gold, I got the lucky charm ("I’m a leprechaun!")
I pull up she say hey I feel like Arnold! ("Hey! Arnold”)
Diamonds on my watch, they look like marbles (ooh they glistenin’!)
You a character, I call you marvel

[Chorus]
I'm about to go and see the dentist ("diamonds! diamonds!")
Bout to go out lurkin’ for them benji’s (hunnids! hunnids!)
In the jag, I’m splurging on you bitches ("skrr, skrr, skrr!")
Fuck a paragraph, they gave my dawg a sentence
Told her mind your fucking business ("mind your damn business!")
He don't know his bitch is in here trickin’
I’ve been catchin’ flights, ain’t catching feelings ("No, No, No!")
I pass her the molly, made her lick it

 [Hook]
I know I'ma see a better day
It gotta be a better place
Gotta get up out of Section 8
I dream about it everyday
Everybody is selling yay
It gotta be a better way
It gotta be a better way

Hey, look, check, look, look, look

I know Imma see a better day
It gotta be a better place
Gotta get up out of Section 8
I dream about it everyday
Everybody is selling yay
It gotta be a better way
I'm out here on a cheddar chase
I was on route 9 tryna get it straight

[Verse 1: Choo Choo]
I feel that lil bro shit killing me
Wanna yard stealing me
My friends turned to my enemies
I ain't been rapping or nothing i'm only feeling me
They know I had to blow up
Yeah I had to flew up
Flying to North Carolina they sayin' Choo Choo done grown up
Thinkin' how imma feel that time i was to up
Lot a liquor from the bar I fucked around and threw up
Fucking with some old friends tryna get my crew up
God knew it, watching me waiting for me screw up
Separate me, whatever it is for me to move up
Too much hating got me thinking gon' pick the tool up
That's what they want, put the gun down they trying to fool us
That's what I'm here, I'm a little older so imma school us
I used to be that bad ass jit on the school bus
Kicking ass, real, I'm crazy, I had to pull her
No ma, I'm somebody and imma be that
I'm on the come up, tell grandma, believe that
My other fam, i don't really think that they'd believe that
People don't wanna believe when they can't see that
Thanks to Lil Kodak, 1k, got my groove back
Be great, all you could be, no matter who laugh
On your team, just keep goin', Choo Choo back
1k, you my lil nigga Lil Kodak, that real

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I know Imma do me something great
Fourth quarter, imma ball, I don't pump fake
I gotta put my brother in a coupe
I need filet mignon, I'm tired of noodle soup
And I been out here going strong in the vocal booth
I just keep it 1K, how I'm supposed to do
90 baby, I just wanna win
I just hope for God to show me who my real friends
I have being going all out now I'm all in
Hoes been runnin' up to me when I walk in
Real slimy, niggas ain't cuttin'
Trick you off the streets, have a nigga cased up
I was out here sleep, had to wake up
I be ten toes down everyday, bruh
I try to maintain, let my nuts hang
It's the same thing young nigga, same thing (selling dope)
I'm stayin' patient, waiting on a blessin'
Rather hit the studio than a class session
Hell raisin on ya boy since 97
Hard headed lil nigga never learned my lesson
Everybody tryna grind up a brick
Hit a lick, go broke, hit another lick
I used to treat him like my brother but that nigga snitch
Had to wait fourth quarter, I was on the bench

[Hook]




 [Intro]
Oh this the real deal, like for real for real?
I thought lil shawty was the real deal and I guess not
But this the real deal? For real?

[Hook]
Lil nigga I got big bank
I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate
You was so wack, I don’t wanna hear your mixtape
His diamonds so wet, he got it out the fish tank
I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate

[Verse 1]
Let it spray, Kodak let it spray
I ain’t got to tote no 5, keep it just in case
Them niggas ever get out of line, put them in they place
‘Cause I be staying out the way, them niggas in the way
It Lil Kodak, I don’t rap, bitch I illustrate
It like I be painting pictures but I picture paint
So why they call you Kodak Black? You sippin’ Easter pink
I be right there at your house, think it’s trick or treat
I be drawing when I speak, see it vividly
I keep a 30 clip but this a Glock 23
Think it's sweet then come and see, I’ma demonstrate
Drop two ounces of codeine in my Minute Maid

[Hook]
Lil nigga I got big bank
I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate
You was so wack, I don’t wanna hear your mixtape
His diamonds so wet, he got it out the fish tank
I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate

[Verse 2]
You ain’t gotta like my music but you gon’ respect me
By the way when you approach me better come correctly
I be on that Little Caesar's shit, hot and ready
All the motherfucking bread, where the damn jelly?
I can’t understand these bitches, they so damn messy
I want to motivate them niggas but I got them jealous
Lil nigga I got big racks
I be flexing, wondering why I ain’t got no six pack
All this flexin’, I deserve to have a six pack
I stay finessing, break a nigga like a Kit-Kat
I stay finessing, break a nigga like a Kit-Kat

[Hook]
Lil nigga I got big bank
I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate

I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate




 [Intro]
Alright, I got, I know how I'mma start this
Dyryk, when we link up, man, we legendary

[Verse]
They be hatin', they be lyin' on me, too
Got a tiger and a lion on me, too
All this Gucci got me lookin' like a zoo
All this water like I'm divin' in a pool, yeah!
All this jewelry, swear to God that I'm a jew
They want me stuck back in the projects like I'm glue
I be slidin' with my 5 'cause I'm too cool
I put your head right on a platter, now you food
She said if I don't keep bein' lit, she swear it's over
She told me if I stop bein' rich, she swear it's over
My nigga be jellin', he be hatin', and I know it
He ain't never tell me, he don't say it, but he show it
Dyryk, don't you stop the beat, my nigga, keep goin'
Dyryk, don't you stop the beat on me, just keep recordin'
I'm finanglin' and wanglin', finessin' gettin' boring
Bought my mom a new three story 'cause we made it out the storm
We got shelter now, doin' better now, feelin' warm
Bought my mom two billy goats, but we gon' eat it if we starvin'
Take a shit right out the door, 'cause I can, and this my yard
Perpendicular my perimeter, all these acres like a farm
And I'll be honest, I'm the G.O.A.T., I was born right in the barn
Woke up feelin' like it, dropped 100 on the Audemars
Cash for gold, I got a pot gold, look like leprechaun
I be hittin' houses, run up in your home, Barry Bonds
Bombs over Baghdad, Sniper Gang Taliban
Ain't never had no damn dad, just my brothers and my mom
Bringin' tears to her eyes, I make her cry like it's fun
I threw away my life a thousand times, but not no more, I'm done
I'm out here packin' iron on Valentine's, I'm thuggin' 'cause it's fun
Make yo' daughter cry on Valentine's, that lovin' shit be dumb
I'm a cowboy for real, my momma call me Bill
Bought her a new crib with a shark and a eel
Look at all the drills, I'm spreadin' Gonorrhea
I was shittin' on her last year, now I diarrhea
All this ice around my wrist, I got the chill
That's why I bought this ice, it's just so I could chill
She be barfin' on my dick, I be like "ew"
I need a heart transplant so I could feel
I drop diamonds on my ear so I could hear
She be gobblin' on my dick just like a meal
I dropped six thousand on my pupils, now my vision clear
Fuck Bonnie and Clyde, she say if I'm Bill, then she Jill
On a pill, holdin' on a seal
On a pill, rollin' off a hill
I'm on a pill, I need xan for real
You turn me on, I love them sexy heels
I'm a grim reaper, make a pussy nigga pay a due
Before I was on BET, I already made the news
I'm pullin' tricks, work go ka-poof like Houdini, who
I be swaggin', you think I know magic, you think I do woo
More stripes than Adidas, I ain't human, I'm a creature
My brother, he a Z, that's my zebra
And we havin' more stripes than Adidas
Fuck the money, nigga, if I don't like you, we can't do no features
Fuck the teacher, I be breakin' rules
Fuck the teacher, they kicked me outta school
Jumped out on that fu, then I peeled off in a coupe
Paint the Cutlass orange, so I peel off like a fruit
All the money look like soup, I be gettin' to the stew
Valentine's Day, but I don't love you, April Fool's
Banana clip on my pack, so I be Bathing Ape
I'm a monkey, got me swingin' with my tool, goin' orangutan




 [Chorus]
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

[Verse 1]
Same night me and Debo took the Mazda, bih we crashed
Bentley Bentayga, snapping like a lobster fuck a crab
They caught the helicopter, I don't want y'all to think I'm tryna flex
Nigga, what's your f'n problem? I'm on that Effen vodka, smoking gas
Yeah, beep, beep, I'm the nigga roadrunning to that cash
Fuck a frisbee, I'll spin n' bend a nigga like I'm Taz
Fuck my daddy, I can't believe I nutted out your sack
Fuck my daddy nigga, it's me and my momma sons like I'm Nash
I made my son king, put this crown on, fuck a ski mask
I swear to god, I get a hard on when this heat blast
Type it like a spacebar, fuck a keypad, think I keep that Mac
Hot shifter, can't control my pace, command, delete his ass

[Chorus]
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

[Verse 2]
I'm hooked on phonics, hooked on Phoenix balling like I'm Steve Nash
Promise you ain't see me, I was in Buffalo with Ray
How you finna cut the hole, y'all just bad
In Charlotte, made a movie with that poker, left a scab
In Raleigh, fell in love with fraud, [?] on that slazz
Steady scheming, burying cheese and burying pieces in the grass
Controversy between the both supremacies, they gone be mad
Martin Luther King, last night I had a dream about his ass
No Rosa Parks, them shooters posted in the back
Nelson Mandela, rocking Maison Margielas, remember wearing Shaqs
Life's a gamble, play the hands they dealt me I'm a wizard at blackjack
In the Jaguar XF, putting a spell on you late night in the black cat

[Chorus]
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past




 [Intro]
Damn..
It's like, it's like once a nigga got in this lil situation everybody stop fucking with me, dawg
They throwing salt on my name
Shit cray
I'm staying down though man
I'm staying solid man I be back out there soon

[Verse 1]
Since a young nigga, nobody couldn't tell me shit
It's Lil Kodak, Project baby coming straight out the bricks
Section 8, where everyone here living off W.I.C
If you lookin' for me, I'm somewhere hittin' a lick
In a rental car, I'm somewhere taking a trip
Keep my head on a swivel, out here you gotta be swift
Lord this is my last trip, forgive me for my sins
On my lonely, road runnin, tryna get to them bands
I done shook back, I'm right back at it again
Puttin' them crosses on the window now I'm gone in the wind
In this life that I live, I learned a lot about friends
And how they just like these bitches because all they do is pretend
Hoes will wanna ride for you if you got your money right
Do anything for you, suck your dick all night
They say they love you forever
They say they with you for life
Soon as shit go sour, them hoe catchin' a flight
I remember those days when I was heated them nights
Cause all I wanted was my people to send me a kite
I done bounced right back, they can't believe they eyes
Everybody tellin' lies say ya boy caught a dime

[Verse 2]
They say we don't fuck with Kodak no more
He done went ghost
We ain't listening to his songs no more, he done fell off
He like another average Joe, like I ain't gonna blow
They talkin' bout me like a hoe they talkin' down on me
Tellin' lies on me, say I caught 11 years
I done lost a lot of friends, shed plenty tears
Could've hung me by my throat and cut my fucking ears
Stay solid, had to do my bid, now I'm here
Road runnin' for that money, we in Chesterfield
You know they say shit real when you in the field
Had to get it how I live, that's just what it is
Tried to put my nigga on, but he fucking squealed
I remember those nights geekin' off a pill
I was real lil with my body full of pills
That lil Haitian out his mind toting big steel
Look at him he pourin' molly in the Zephyrhills




 [Intro: Future]
It's that Project Baby
And we about fifteen up, you know what I mean?
They 'gon try take advantage of this money
Shit coming in fast
They know we ain't got a blueprint of this shit
We just came into this shit with it already

[Chorus: Future]
Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
All I know, identity theft, I buried all the credit cards
G1 had me in the kitchen, sellin' hard and doin' fraud
Took me out the 'jects, now I'm flyin' private jets, nigga
'Member snatchin' chains, I got my own around my neck, nigga
I caught five kidnappin', but I ain't no babysitter
I caught five kidnappin', how you let me take your nigga?
Posted on the ugly, I jump out, go to bustin'
My baby mama dusty, got my little one out here musky
Skrrt, skrrt, pull up in a vert, call it a pullback, ayy
Pull up in a Wraith, they be like "Who is that"?
Pulling up in luxury, thank God, ain't no more strugglin'
I'm rollin' 'round, I be duffelin'
She under arrest, I'm cuffin' it

[Chorus: Future]
Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I just beat the case, I'm ridin' in a double R
Spread the cheese with your people, gotta feed the squad
I bought my mama and my brothers, them another car
At first I was playin' with this shit, but now I'm goin' hard
It's like my baby mama feel like she the superstar
I threw away the Fossil watch and bought an Audemars
Was in the 'Yota, now I'm ridin' in the luxury car
I was off the chain, now a youngin' on the charts
I was ridin' Suzuki, ayy, now I'm actin' boujee, ayy
Now I'm coolin', foolin', I'm just 'bout my music
No more shootin' cee-lo, poppin' wheelies on the Banshee
Can't be thuggin' no more, homie, I stay in a mansion
I'm on mollys and the Xannies, feel extravagant
Took me off the ugly corner, I'm ridin' panoramic
You hate the way I'm transitionin', I'm corporate thugging
You miss when I was headfirst, when I wasn't gettin' no money

[Chorus: Future]
Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case, yeah

I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her

[Verse 1]
See, Imma drink a pint, lil momma damn, she got nice butt
Then you can come and tie lil momma down, you could wife her
If you got them bands, then she might fuck
I'm in Fort Myers with G1 sellin' white stuff
I had to hit that lick, it's a gamble everyday
I here you gotta take a risk
How else you think I wrapped the Cuban link around my wrist?
Now I'm bendin' corners, I got forgis on my whip
Cashed out, nigga, I've been racked up ever since
Movin' short on them bills, now I pay my momma rent
Remember sellin' dope to my next door neighbor then
Knock, knock, ain't nobody home we breakin' in

[Hook]
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her

[Verse 2]
Boss my life up, it wasn't nothin' else to do
You should try it too, you should run a check or two
I'm tryna make it out, you could be successful too
Ain't tryna make it out? Then sorry I can't hang with you
Girl I can't hang with you, lil homie I can't mess with you
I'm bout my cheddar, you should go get you some cheddar too
Go get you a check or two, that what you better do
So you can free yourself a lil bit, when you steppin' through
I had to boss up, I had to cut some people off
To be the boss, you gotta learn how to take a loss
Bible on the dash, road runnin' with the cross
Goin' up top, touch down like Randy Moss

[Hook]
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her




 [Intro]
I just bought a new Glock
I just bought a new glizzy
I just bought a new Glock
I just bought a new Glock

[Verse]
I just bought a new Glock, cost me three fifty
I used to lay these niggas down so I sleep with it
I be tryna chase my dreams but I be fighting demons
My Glock got a dick, I even pee with it
It's a XD, boy don't test me
Do your homework, boy I be with it
I get reckless nigga
I don't need my team wit' me
I ain't no selfish nigga so my whole team winning
And I ain't rescuing no hoe, I'm a keep pimpin'
I ain't Supermanin', I ain't savin' you
I just dropped a album, Project Baby Two
I got a son now, my little baby two
I got snakes on my gucci, I'm a Python
I got snakes in my closet but not in my yard
Snakes on my collarbone but not in my lawn though
Doing fraud, I heard that money good in Colorado
A new Glock this a nine, Rajon Rondo
Every show I do now look like the Apollo
Shawty said she love me
Project baby pull up on a nigga no Huggie
Put my BM in the BM used to drive a punch buggy
Kodak Bock I don't milly rock, I don't dougie
Yah, going up, top with Nene
Kodak Bop, I don't do the nay-nay
You won't never catch me tryna dab
I be posted on the slab, selling slab
I just bought a new Glock, generation four
Remember eating hot cheetos with sweet n low
Hot sauce with my Lays chips, eating rice with honey
Got me reminiscing 'bout my life when I ain't had no money
Just drunk a whole fifth, smoked a ounce of weed
I left stems in it, but I threw away the seeds
Almost threw away my life
I threw away the glove but I kept the ski on
Thugging with my res on
I'm on house arrest but I don't be home
I'm running through ya hoe, running in yo door
Got me running through this door like chain on eskimo
I'm grippin' on my tool, I will let it go
I can't keep my cool, I will let it snow
Free my nigga locked up, eating sloppy joes
Probably playing spades, probably playing dominoes
My gun ain't on safety, I won't play with you
So I advise you find you something safe to do
Cause I keep the fire on and I got a firearm
If you run up on me, nigga flaming you
Cause I got a home , gotta make it to em
On top of that, I got a son, my little baby two
I just bought a new wraith and it's baby blue
Project Baby 2, my lil baby two
I just got me a brand new glizzy
And I put a green bean in it




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye look I'm a take it back a lil' piece
I'm still a young nigga, I'm still a jitter bug
I'm talkin' about way back when Clemon used to ride through the 'jects

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm slangin' K, yea I be dealin' shit and stealin' shit
Back in the day, I was a fool and I was ignorant
I'm not a killer, but my nigga they on that killer shit
I'm 'bout my skrilla, I be dealin' just like a dealership
I mean wit' that fire, but my lil' dawg he make your street rock
Rap don't pop, I'm in the kitchen whippin' heat rock
Back in the day, I'm talkin' Dickey with my Reebok
I'm on a jigga, and I'm swingin' like a seesaw
I hit the news, I hit the news, I hit the news again
My mama warned me, that's this was what the streets gonna do to me
I'm from the No, I go hit a lick on a dirtbike
Right on a stroll, the plug just fronted me a dirtbike

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

[Verse 2: Jackboy]
Back in the days, I was on the Ugly Corner
Trynna stack a pretty penny late night sellin' zona
Graduated from the streets but I ain't got a diploma
Been a little soldier hittin' licks around the 'Nolia
In and out of stolen cars, ridin' with Lil' soya
Had the coke no cola makin' stretch with the soda
Be a soul jumped behind us hit the gas, crash the 'Yota
If JJ's phone calls, mama sayin' boy I told you
Back in the day, them hoes left me on my own
Pullin' 'em now, won't quit callin' my phone
Dawg all of these bitches, Lil' Jackboy just want his bone
Don't wanna fuck in the car, made her ass walk home

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

[Verse 3: John Wicks]
Back in the days, I was the runner, was the gunner man
Back in the days, you couldn't chill on the corner then
Back in the days, was one on ones, ain't no jumpin' in
Back in the days, my mama told me ain't no funny shit
Broke get a job, they helped the family cause we strugglin' yea
Back in the days, my mama told me get that money
So I stopped sellin' reefer
I'm kickin' doors and robbin' corner stores
I'm John Wicks baby, you know me I'll let that hammer go
Back in the days, I ain't have shit but now I'm stuntin' though
They wasn't fuckin' with me, but now today I got a ton of hoes
They lovin' my style, I'm Wick got mouth full of golds
No central air but now I'm iced out like a eskimo

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

And shot her 20 racks
Don't believe her name Raven
You can go and fuckin' ask
But I thank the Lord I made it
All I gotta do is rap

[Chorus: Offset]

My jeweler chain sent the wrong bracelet to my boo
I'm with Blac Chyna but she ain't nothin' but a Florida swoop
She say I'm a dawg, Snoop
I'm runnin' too hot for you
I don't need no child from you
It's Project Baby 2




 [Intro]
Ayy, Ben, I always call you when I need a hit, man
I call you when I need to roll one
I call you when I need to roll one
You call me when you need to hold something

[Verse 1]
You only call me when you need a loan
And I'm only talkin' murder on my other phone
She be right here like she post to
And I'm havin' ruffles on my shoulder
You know I love to shine, so my gun plated gold
You havin' your high, got me on my tippy toes
I'm already zombie, I ain't gotta sell my soul, baby
Own a mansion now, my last home done got old

Flyer than these niggas, man, niggas be flyin' cold
And I'm takin' money with the dope now
I promise I'm a junkie on the dope now
Takin' Molly got me takin' souls
Takin' Mollys fucked me up, I know

And I'm bringin' hell on Earth for these hoes
You my heaven on Earth, you my H.O.E baby

Lookin' in my rear view, I ain't paranoid, I'm on point
In the club with twenty of my niggas but I'm on one
She said, "Kodak, is you flyer than my nigga?" uh huh
Police asked if I know what happened to that nigga, uh uh
They like, "Really? It ain't none of your goddamn business, noneya"
You niggas got the same drip, I'm drippin' custom
Kill a nigga broad daylight just because
Kill a nigga right in public 'bout my brothers
I don't play no games, you could miss me with the fun
'Cause I got a AR-15 in the trunk
Lil' nigga, but I'm big like I'm Pun
I parked the Wraith, then I pulled up in a Dawn
Sniper Gang Taliban, I'm a junkie
Remember hittin' stores, hidin' in a dungeon
Jump out with my orange ski mask like I'm pumpkin
I run out on you faggot ass niggas, y'all be punkin'
Even though I'm little, I be makin' big boy moves
They know that I'm little, so I got a lot to prove

My family called me God's son, 'cause I'm gon' need bloodshed

Sniper Gang, most of my niggas done gone fed

Catch me slidin' in the decoy, fuck a Maybach
She said, "Do you fuck with D-Boy?" that was way back
I split yo' wig, I put your top right where your tape at

 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah
This my shit right here
This my kinda shit right here
Y'all know me, the son

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
If I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind
It's gon' take time
Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind
See my nigga workin' hard, that shit paid him off fine
None of this shit just fall from the sky
I'm puttin' in work, I done forgot that I was tired

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Can a nigga eat in peace?
You leechin' for a crumb
Niggas ain't even showin' ya love where ya from
Them people took my 40s, so I'm about to go buy a pump
What if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?
Can I take you out to lunch?
I just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach
I just made shawty tell a man that she done
Lately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?
I'm gone, I'm done
I shook and went describin'
I'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance
Fuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses
Robbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse]
I wake up, say my prayers, brush my mouthpiece
Get fresh, before I leave I tuck my nine-piece
Okay, I hit the dice game, I head cracked 'em
Quarterback, if he got the work, I'ma sack 'em
I came up hittin' highzes, I'm from the projects
I bought me a 7 plate and reroute it
Dropped it, cut a couple ones and made a profit
Runnin' your dope, I bought a key, don't knock it
Kamikaze, I'm turnt up, I'm a zombie
Jaw lockin', hey molly, you got me
I surrender, they got the prints from my finger
I was starvin', stomach growlin', no dinner
Lace my Timbs up, knock first then poke your window
In the rental, go up top with my Benzo
I remember, sorry that I'm a sinner
Serial killer, rest in piece to instrumental
I'm goin' hard, you're soft, you're too gentile
Model broad, pussy bald, she got cancer
I can't hold back, it's lil Kodak, and you know that
I hit the booth, I leave my shoes at the doormat
Load and cock it, topic, make it go bad
Silly rabbit, by my carat, get a toe tag
Project baby, get 'em, I go 'em
Polo'd down, pop a nigga like a collar
Bonfire, pray your boy top dollar
Top shotta, skrrr right by ya
Rastafari pullin' up in that 'Rari
No dread head but I chief the Bob Marley
Ohh sorry, we just chew-chewin' your girl then didn't train her
Don't main her, I try tell them

[Outro]
Nigga I'm over seven. I don't fuck around with your celibate. My t-roid (?) nigga, knicks

Shit ain't go the way I plan
Niggas out here taking chances
Out here you gotta take a chance

[Verse]
Don't let them tell you that you can't
Cause I already know I can
How the fuck you finna tell me
I do whatever cause I can
He living off of pots and pans
That work gon' come back looking tanned
Think that nigga doing magic
How you whip it with no hands
And he wrap it in saran
We be snapping for them bands
Once I walk in you can smell me
Weed be louder than a band
I be smiling but I ain't playing
What you saying, better be playin'
It ain't nothing you can tell me
What you saying ain't even payin'
Tucked it right inside my pants
I hope no one can see the print
I turn nothing into something
Remember we couldn't pay the rent
I just booted up again
She say that molly look like Xan
How you think I get so healthy
Smoking broccoli to the stem




 [Intro]
Dawg, I swear dawg
It's like I, like I got a whole 'nother soul and shit
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby

[Verse 1]
I got my grandma a mansion in Haiti
I feel like we still be goin' through slavery
I need to cool it off all of these drugs
I be to quick reachin' out for my gun
I hope my son don't turn out to a thug
I know that gangster shit run in his blood
My baby mama keep listenin' to punks
They tellin' her to go after my funds
They hate that people be showing me love
I got more money then any of 'em, I'm young
Harriet Tubman, I'm still on the run
I'm thinkin' 'bout all of the shit that I done
I'm tryna cover my dirt
I put in so much work
Sniper Gang, this ain't a business
Sniper Gang, this how I'm living
I need to change how I'm living
I think I'm way too committed
When I ain't thuggin' I miss it
My trigger finger be itching

[Chorus]
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby

[Verse 2]
I think I'm losing my conscience
I pray to god that I find it
I used to pop too much mollies
I think it fucked up my noggin
All I be thinkin' about it
I need to stay out the projects
'Cause all of my niggas be wylin'
I don't know where I'd be without it
How I'ma stay out the projects?
When that's where I got all my knowledge
Remember we used to be robbin'
But now he don't like how I'm striving
No Bud, I ain't drinkin' no beer
Every day I'm getting wiser
I'm happy I got away solid
E picked me up when I shot him
I had to ditch all the sliders
I need to change my surroundings
I'm tryna be a lil calmer
I can't go back to the bottom

[Chorus]
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change my lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas, man
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Bridge]
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zircon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (yeah)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming)

This is not a rental, this a stolo here, lil boy
In a new apartment, this is where I park my car
Got a few options, I just pick these hoes apart
I got snipers in my car
I be bitin', I don't bark
I just light, I just spark
Then I light it up and spark
If it come out in the light
It'll happen in the dark
Got the fire with me, lil boy

Hit the dentist, and put permanents in my gums
They say, "Kodak, you don't never show no love"
You ain't love me, nigga, before I made it
Said she love me, now I'm rich and famous
My lil cranium is updated

 [Verse: Kodak Black]
I got quality and quantity
So every single day I keep droppin' shit
They just piss-test me today I was positive
Project baby, a product of my environment
They just put a trespass on me in the 'jects
Them crackas said they wanna never catch me in the 'jects
What you expect? For me to never come out of house?
Pop a X with my niggas, late night poppin' bottles
Just wanna hit the store and a buy bottle of some water
Post up on the stroll and hear what I been missing out on
My nigga say he went to rehab but he got right back on flocka
My other nigga popped a c class then that pussy came up out 'em
Like it's winter I be posted like a snowman but it's Autumn
Since elementary I wanted to be a G, I dreamed it back in Markham
My mom regret, I was always your lil' problem
Young nigga, I'm the husband in the house and I'm the father
My brother John Wicks, he was robbin' tell me nothing 'bout it
My brother was robbin' poppin'  tops but he ain't never tell me 'bout it
*Why didn't you pay for this beat though?*
What you mean why I ain't pay for this beat? 'Cause ima motherfucking robber
I was in Fort Myers I was 15, and I was servin' Demi Lovato
I tried to shoot 'em, he had the voo on him, I turned into a monster
I told my brother what happened to my revolver
I was so mad I asked my brother  "What the hell happened to my revolver?"
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
I was creepin', I was schemin', on that nigga on the low
I promise ain't nobody see me that whole weekend in the 'No
Ay, Ay, the world cold I put that heater on 'em tho
Wasn’t stressing but I wanted to relieve it on the [?]
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
If I was him I woulda' beat me to the floor
Then that nigga started creepin' very slow
That nigga he started leavin' very slow
Started skipping, getting away like it’s a [?]
Yeah he protected, but he still scared of me
I was just 14 years old, I'm on methamphetamine
Y'all just sittin' 'round smokin' weed and watching Netflix
Every day I wanna do somethin' hot, in a stolo for no reason
Parked it in a vacant spot, and they towed 'cause I left it parked right in my neighbor lot, ay, I put that burner on that nigga, told him if he make one more move he gettin' popped
I dare you nigga, take one more step you gettin' stretched out
I customized a 38, it got a drum like I'm [?]
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
[?] my window roadrunning, got this rental here from Hertz
I'm conditioned trained myself to be authentic and be pure
And I'm back, got that black cat, make that kitty purr
Everything I rap about these streets would vouch for me I'm sure
Clothesline in my backyard, no new white tee, rewash dingy shirt




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah, Project Baby
These streets took my conscience
Glee
Sniper Gang
These streets took my conscience

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Yeah, everybody with me on that same thang
I don't gang-bang but I bang bang
I pull up to the club, I got on eight chains
Took that bitch to Wings-N-Things, she wanna be my main

[Verse 2: Future]
Brown liquor made my dawg insane
Booted up or geeked, it's the same thang
Fish scale or molly, it's the same name
Murder by the stains, which gang you claim?
The big Patek face cost ten chains
Took your bitch out to eat on a private plane
Real talk, 150 when it's plain Jane
Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Ayy, free my nigga Cool, he in the chain gang
Chris Johnson, I swear for God I drop the twenty-eight
I told my nigga be smooth (cool), he put a potato on a barrel
I kick her dumbass out my crib, say she want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor ass hoe a Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

[Verse 4: Future]
Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry
Thirteen strippers, James Harden
Money make you greedy when you starving
Monisha, Tamica, they vouching
Before I had anything, I was saucing
Before I had that Bentley truck, I was saucing
All these hitters, yeah, I pray you never cross them

[Verse 5: Kodak Black]
She say she pregnant, I swear I think I wanna off her
Eighteen hunded, I got more stories than a author
I'm credit card swipin' at the Chase Bank (ey)
Me and Future gang gang, same thang
I check your temperature, nigga, is you hot or cold?
Like a state trooper, I make my money on the road
I remember hittin' houses, nigga, cash 4 gold
These streets made me lose my conscience, took a nigga soul

[Verse 6: Future]
These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show
I know my niggas got love for me
And they filling up they nose
I know my Levi got love for me
She just want everybody to know

[Verse 7: Kodak Black]
I know my niggas, they be missin' me
So I be posted on the stroll
I don't even care about how much cash I see
I'm always gon' be in the 'No
I ran out of money, then they switch lanes
I ran it back up, then I switch lanes
In a brand new Range, diamond colored candy cane
I bought a brand new K, I can't wait to let it spray
I'm sorry mom ain't mean to bring you through so much pain
I said I'm sorry mom, I ain't mean for it to be this way
Ayy but fuck it, bitch, I'm here, I got diamond rings
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid

[Outro: Kodak Black]
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid

Pull up, make them bitches faint

Youngest nigga in the game
I'm fourteen when I caught a case
I was fifteen with a thirty-eight
I was sixteen, went to Larry James
I'm coolin' but the block on fire
Scoop the 28 out the pot
None of my niggas ain't went to college
All of my niggas they out the projects
Drop the money, catch the body

Fuck with me, you know I got it

Remember playin' in the dirt
Call me Dora, it's in my backpack
Fuck that ho 'cause she a nat nat
I'm gon' always keep a clapback
I'm gon' always keep a gat
Give me head, I call it a snapback
I just drove up in a hatchback
Got them pounds, ain't talkin' hashtags
Boy, I'm workin' with that sack
Your old lady say you fool
I just ran off with your boo
Told me everythin' you say
She told me everythin' you do
Ayy, I'm playin' with that wool

You fuckin' with my zoes

You would think I'm blind 'cause I be rockin' heavy shades
I gotta keep the fire, try me, I'ma let it rain
'Cause I be walkin' round with a big scary chain
All winter I'm posted up, I'm sellin' candy cane
Before I made my move, I had to let it marinate
I beat the pot with the spoon and watch the dope lock up
I drop the 5 in the deuce like I'm Urlacher
Don't make me run up in your gig 'cause I'm a show stopper
I got 99 bands, I ain't got no problems
Ayy, repeat what you just said, you don't want no problems

 [Intro]
Yes, Yes I'm your blessing ma
Mama I know
Sometimes I act crazy but I'm still your baby
The projects made me like this you can't blame me

[Verse]
Mama I'm still your baby but the streets corrupt me
I'm sorry I fell in love with guns, I fell in love with thuggin'
I'm clutchin', I keep that Colt .45 everyday like Tony Dungy
I shoulda just listened to what you said but I don't really like instructions
I don't be wantin' to hear nothing
'Cause I was lookin' up to my cousin
They was in and out of jail, that was all I seen
So I knew what I wanted to be as a youngin'
Mama said she hate my stubbornness
Why I gotta be so grumpy
When it comes to anger don't rush it
You gon' end up in a dungeon
I hate my attitude but I love him
'Cause I don't really be with that fuck shit
Mama I'm fried, I be just tryna vibe
I ain't really trying to get impulsive
Sittin' back sippin' on Hennessey
Niggas tryna drain out my energy
Ain't no bad vibe in these premises
I can feel the vibe you envy me
Tryna stay level-headed keep my head straight
But the devil he don't want to see me go the better way
Deep in my heart lookin' for the love I had
My heart was gold but these dirty streets turned it black
I was a good lil' nigga life turned me bad
Can't show sympathy, I might get whacked
On probation but I know I got to stay strapped
Went on a lick geek, I forgot my face mask
Went on a lick geek, turn up on a nigga ass
When they let me out VA, I had 30 stash
Poppin' fraud 'cause this rap shit wasn't bringin' cash
Always takin' care of my mama 'cause she all I had
You would think a boy roller bladin'
How I skated so much ramifications
I coulda got draft to the Patriots
NFL, run up on me get deflated
Drop some but I caught a lot of cases
On route, goin' up top on a safety
I pray to Yahweh could you save me?
Lately, I been goin' back crazy
Maybe if you be my lady
I might stop all this ragin'
Baby could you be my lady?
I just been sittin' here thinkin'
Wonder if you could be my lady
I be goin' through some phases
I don't want to know new faces
Everybody 'round me changin'
I was just talkin' about this to my partna them
I just gave a pussy ass hoe a compliment
Thought she was a thousand, I just start to like the bit
Nine dollar bill that ain't real she counterfeit

[Outro]
My nigga I was so close of wifin' it
I ain't brought it in, she's triflin'
All along she was just a bodit bitch
She a slimey bit, she a grimey bitch
She conniving, she a sloppy bitch
Don't go out like that, she a nat
Fall back Black she a nat
Don't go out like that she a nat




 [Verse 1]
I kinda feel some type of way right now, it's crazy
It's a lot of shit on my mind, I'm up just thinkin'
I got shit to say but don't know how to say it
I be feelin' like everybody be tryna play me
If you my bih then let them niggas know you taken
Would you be my bih even if I don't ever make it?
If I lose it all right now bet you gon' shake me
She don't like me, she just wanna have my baby
I been on point cause I been outchea since a baby
They left me standin' out the door while it was rainin'
It get cold they wouldn't much let me get a blanket
Now I'm spreadin' Benjamin Franklin's in they faces
It's Lil Kodak, I be flexin' and they hate it
Maybe they don't like me just because I'm Haitian
Sittin' 'round me but you schemin' on my bracelet
Rock designer, always jump out with the latest
Pullin' up in foreigns, I might hop out with yo' lady
She don't wanna fuck with you no more, she say you basic
I don't need nobody to handle my situation
I be duckin' from the cops like it's the Matrix




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
I had to snatch my golds out you know what I'm saying and go diamonds
Shawty said I look like I got Plies teeth
Pussy ahh hoe every nigga in Florida got permanent golds

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I just want to win and see all my niggas win
My nigga lost his trial, asked God why he ain't win
I'm sliding in a Fin-Fin with a FN
AC pipping, windows crossed up behind tint
My eyes on the prize, interstate 95
Yellow brick road but my rims gold
Yellow brick road trynna make it home
Went 95
You know how it go, I ain't flipping french fries
I got checkbooks, got that work but no 9-5
Drive through with that big mac on the passenger side
Big Mac to your face, kill a nigga appetite
What's the point of going to college just to serve apple pies

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm the best because I beat the best, David and Goliath
Before the show money, I was grinding in Fort Myers
5.95, kicking doors in Pembroke Pines
Finessing all my life, all I know is slang that iron
She said that I look like Plies, so I put diamonds in my mouth
These permanents, just like them tears in your mama eyes
When you die nigga, I hope she tired of crying nigga
I got 7 now, I remember I had 5 figures
Yea, that's your main bitch I'm just a side nigga
I fucked that bitch bare than I prayed about it
I snucked that nigga bare than I prayed about it
Free Lil Soto, they accusing him for 3 bodies
I did my [?], I skeeted off and popped 3 mollies
A nigga just died last night
I was way in Georgia on a flight
I’m fuckin’, I ain’t takin’ off my Nikes
I'm fucking I ain't cutting off the lights
I'm cut throat but I ain't running with a knife
Boy it’s on sight, Sniper Gang call me Wesley Snipes
Wedding band ring, married to the game throwing rice

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin




 [Intro]
Ayy, look, I say "I don't rap, I illustrate. I don't paint pictures, I picture-paint." Ha, this my motherfuckin' album
Kodak Black-
Kodak Black-
The nineteen-year-old Pompano Beach rapper-
-is reportedly back in jail after he was arrested today in Broward County, Florida

Mr. Octave, do you accept your plea?
-in the two terminal cases that have put his musical career on hold
-troubled rapper found himself back behind bars after violating the terms of his house arrest
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You know I'm a hot boy, but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire, that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block boy, I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could
And I wonder why, when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why, these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga, who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time, could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time, ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool, I know right now he prolly sleep
One day at a time, ten toes down until you're free

[Chorus]
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef, had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day

[Verse 2]
They gave Lil' Markie twenty-five, that's my man (ayy)
Remember hittin' licks and runnin' up them bands (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Greg sixteen years in the pen (ayy)
For all my niggas locked up, I'm goin' H.A.M. (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Ceelo twenty years, free my nigga
They say Lil' Tracy gettin' out this December
I dropped fifty-five bands from my hand
They done let me out, so now I'm goin' in
Before he go back, shoot it out with the police (ayy)
So that mean he goin' to court in these streets (ayy, ayy)
He goin' to trial right there where he stands (ayy)
For everybody did me wrong, I want revenge (ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef,  had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day

[Outro]
This my motherfuckin' album
Paintin' pictures man, lil' Kodak, you already know that

 [Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I ain't gone sugarcoat nothing
I'ma tell you times when I was up
I'ma tell you times I was struggling
When I was starving for that cash
Say I was money hungry
Was on my ass down bad
I needed food in my stomach
When I be rapping they love it
But I'm out here snapping like, "Fuck it"
Keep my head on a swivel
And keep my mind on that money
I ain't worried 'bout the fame
I fell in love with the game
She be giving me head
But I fell in love with her brain
I got love for my niggas
I know they love me the same
When I was going through my struggle
A couple of them changed
It's okay, I'm straight
'Cause I can hold up my weight
I was locked up in my cell
Had everything on wait
I'm on 1800 block, nigga, shouts out [Bake]
Once the road got bumpy, niggas went the other way
Everybody forsake me
Ain't no need for debating
I was showing love to niggas when I knew they was hating
Is it true or you faking?
I was gone on vacation
Now I'm back off vacation
And I'm like fuck, nigga, pay me
Gotta think before you speak
'Cause you don't know what you saying
Started off with a baby
Now I'm riding on Dayton's
I can't lose I'm just gaining
Once you sleeping I'm waking
You know I love .38s
But I still tote the .380
I'm a project baby
I'm tryna hit the suburbs
I'm tired of looking over my shoulder
Posted up on the curb
Posted up tryna serve
You wasn't there, you just heard
I be going with the flow
I just look back and observe
Got a trick up my sleeve
I got a lick for them D's
Got your bitch on her knees
She suck my dick with no teeth
I say Momma I can't swim, but I'm knee deep in these streets
I'm like fuck the industry because I'm deep in these streets




 [Intro]
Kodak (know dat)
I on want dat fake ahh lean I pod it right out the ceal
And if it don't make dollaz then it ain't no deal

[Hook]
I buy Rolexes, yeah
So I can get my time, any second
Help me get my mind, cause I'm stressing
Mama said I shine right, cause I'm destined
Damn I live a hard life, It's a blessing
Pan up wid one mic, it's a weapon
How Ima get my grind right, I'm just guessin
I need an answer, I got a question?
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
Im out the hood out the A, yeah the section
I run the road every day, exit to exit
State to state I'm progressing
Back and forth I'm stepping
Ain't going back nomore they won't let me
Look at my necklace, pull up in the exess, pull up in bentleys, jumping out Lexus and jetsey
I'm swimming in the money fuck a jet skie, let reach
Test me, 40 cal in a kick in like a jetlee
Married to the money she said yes to me
And she don't want no ugly bitch to be next to me
Money talk yall can't even send a text to me
I'm whipping the dope they want the recipe

[Hook]
I buy Rolexes, yeah
So I can get my time, any second
Help me get my mind, cause I'm stressing
Mama said I shine right, cause I'm destined
Damn I live a hard life, It's a blessing

How Ima get my grind right, I'm just guessin
I need an answer, I got a question?
Yeah...

[Verse 2]
Lime light, I'm riding rover
Yeah I live the high life, ain't never sober
Early bird time flies, I'm getting older
First they was on my side

Can't open my eyes, I'm blowing dozier
Gambling wid my life, it's like poker
30 inches on my ride boy don't go dea them boy low dea
Oh dea like, dea go dat Zoe dea
So so rare, red bottom so fresh I bought 4 pair
Ion feel nun so ion go bare
Ion catch feelings I catch flights in in yo hoe air

[Hook]

 [Hook]
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things

[Verse]
I tried to explain, I swear, I tried to explain
Think lil Kodak got it good, cause the money and the fame
I got to leave the street where it's at, fell in love with the game
Studio night and day, now they say I ain't the same or I changed, cause I don't, come to my side no more and play
I don't shoot dice no more, cause I ain't got time to hang
They say I'm going insane
They say the mollies eating up my brain
I miss my nigga Cool
Like right now, I'd be with him chasing money and be running with'em
I just tried get'em with you
They water break
I'm tired of fake niggas, I'd let you walk in my shoes but you can't fit'em
Hard for a project baby
Sometimes I hate, I let the project raise me
I'm a bastard child, so the streets made me a man
That lil baby gonna grow up to that pistol and I can see it

[Hook]
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things

[Bridge]
When I get out of these streets and do the same things

[Verse]
When its going good God don't hear from me but when its bad I get sad and I get on my knee
Take me through this battle, but I not gonna let you leave
Send them haters around me and I won't let'm leave
Need a break just fall back and get my mind straight
Feeling like the devil took me on a blind date
I ain't coming home tonight when I'm on a mission
Niggas feening and I'm the only youngin with'em
Somethings I be tripping
Folks say I'm a ghetto child, they say I'm ignorant
Just listen
I might need a minute
I hope this beat was long, cause I need them to hear me
Can't make the lemonade, life just gave me lemons
Feel like they don't understand
They don't get it
I've been up all night
I just had to lay this verse down to clear my mind
I can't believe I thought you were my friend
Here I am in the move bleed[?] my soul again

[Hook]
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things




 [Intro]
You see, it's crazy, dog, 'cause
You give a nigga this emotion that
I thought ain't even exist in a nigga no more
See, like, I don't even wanna be, if I can't be with you

[Hook]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

[Verse 1]
You know you make me new
You motivate me too
I'm fucking with you, boo
Imma keep it funky with you, boo
When we make love, I ain't got my glove on
When we make love, I ain't got my thug on
Girl, you got me singing love songs
Where the fuck I get this love from?
I got London on the beat
She like fucking on the beach
Girl, you fucking with a G
How did you end up with me?

[Hook]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

[Verse 2]
Look what you did to a boss, babe
You got me nailed to the cross, babe
You got a young nigga open
You got my nose wide open
You got lil' Kodak in a moment
I was locked up sending you roses
And, baby, when I ride, I wanna ride for you
And, baby, when I die, I wanna die with you
Girl, you know Imma keep it a stack, like a thousand dollars, boo
Girl, you know Imma keep all this stack, I'd never lie to you
Ain't no point in living, If I can't live my life with you
Girl, If you ain't right by my side, I don't know what Imma do

[Hook]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you




 Yeah I'm that youngin from the projects
Stolen cars, but I'm gettin' money now, so I bought a Jag
She want me to love her, eat that pussy good
Slide it in her ass, but I'm not familiar with that
I'm not the student at the front seat of the class
Teacher's pet, a class clown cause I ain't go to class
Why go to school? I know all I need to know
And I'm gettin' cash for gold money so why should I pass now
I'm sittin' on a crate chillin' in the shade
Fresh cut, Kodak fade
On my corner with them thangs
Come get you a pillow sack 5 for 20
I got nicks and dimes
What you want? Zone or high grade?
Shoot it you fade away
Money come every day
You can get it anyway
See I'm gettin' it every way
Lil Kodak
Salute me I'm Mr. K
Where is my cake?
Super cold [?]
I can't be fuckin' all these hoes
And I can't be makin' friends
Don't be them foes you don't know they hatin' on the low
I'm that lil nigga from the 'Noya
That lil zo
I be Polo to the floor
Boy, don't act like you don't know
I came up shootin' dice by the dope hole
Throwin' licks, the youngest nigga out here posted on the scroll
Snatchin' chains, I fell in love with that gold
She be shinin', she's so pretty
Boy, I love that hoe
My people be tryna tell me leave the streets alone
But they see I just won't listen
They say "just let him go"
They got me at running back and now I'm runnin' them back
And Coupe say when I get older I be runnin' the sac
I'm that ratchet jay baker rap maniac
Where's that? Pockets fat
Hit my first lick I don't know how to act
New cracker say I look like lil Boosie
And plus I rock the Boosie
They call me Boosie, they say I'm so easy to catch
They say I'm ADHD, schizophrenic
My pistol panic, it just be firing
Get nervous, I can't handle it
Project Baby, and you know that I am him
My nigga found me, he was with me shootin' in the gym
I was settin' him up for 3's, but I was scorin' more than him
He wanted to be the team, grabbed my ball straight off the rim
My main bitch be trippin'
She not my main, but the only reason she my main cause I ain't got no other bitches
I be stolo slidin' foreign
She be nervous when she in it
I be drivin' on the mollys, I be rollin like a filly
Ghetto child, posted with that 9 like Ibaka
Ugly corner jet, 40 cal hit you like [?]
Lil nigga big old pistol, I can't shoot no chopper
Rock designer, Ferragamo, Prada fly like Harry Potter




 [Verse 1]
I know you from the Bronx
Heard it's cold, it's like my heart
Let me book ya a first class flight to Florida where it's hot
I'ma take ya down south, show you what I'm rappin' 'bout
Young niggas, 14, permanent golds in they mouth
I be jumpin' on these beats, remember sleepin' on the couch
Every nigga in these streets know about me, they can vouch
I'm still wearin' Ree's like I'm still out here sellin' rock
Like my Ree's, you gon' let me tie ya down or you not?
When you wanna vacay? MIA is the spot
Where you hop on jet skis, niggas ridin' on yachts
Four wheelers, cuban links, niggas hoppin' out the drop
Show ya 'round the Noya, Ugly Corner, 1800 Block

[Hook]
Girl you motivate me, I been wonderin' lately
And I was thinking, you and me
I be smilin' baby when you call me baby
You know how to drink me, make me weak
Baby girl you special
I'ma try my best to, give you enough effort in the week
Am I bein' extra?
Am I oversteppin' my boundaries?

[Verse 2]
'Cause girl you got me singin'
I feel like I'm figulatin'
I might switch my occupation and just open up a bakery
'Cause every night, we cakin'
Girl you sweeter than Miss Allie
I might eat ya like a pastry, and keep ya like my .380
Say I been trippin' lately
I been in my feelings lately
I ain't even been jiggin', while they stickin', we conversatin'
I ain't been trickin' with these bitches even though you ain't my lady
We ain't seal the deal but I'ma keep it real and be patient
I'm runnin' with them Z's, remember dancin' with the devil
You 26, but I'm 2613 forever
Young rebel but I'm clever
I don't get too sentimental
Now I got you where I want you
I know the spot like a freckle
I know what it is now
I know how I feel now
I wanna build now, me with you
Call me on the FaceTime
Heard it through the grapevine, that I wanna plant my seed with you
You gon' make me change my ways
Postin' on my page, WCW
I want you to be my main
I don't want no one but you

[Hook]
Girl you motivate me, I been wonderin' lately
And I was thinking, you and me
I be smilin' baby when you call me baby
You know how to drink me, make me weak
Baby girl you special
I'ma try my best to, give you enough effort in the week
Am I bein' extra?
Am I oversteppin' my boundaries?

[Outro]
Put that pussy on my diamonds like toothpaste

 [Intro]
'Ight, come on
Aye

[Verse 1]
I'm turned up on a jolly
I will milly rock on any block fuckin' Kodak boppin'
I will hit a nigga with that Glock, don't really do no talkin'
I will Diddy bop on any thot, she suck me 'till she coughin'
I will let it rip on all of y'all, just try me bitch I promise
Call me K, I got knowledge, keep the K cause I got knowledge
I be ballin' like Phoenix, but they say I'm hooked on phonic
You won't catch a nigga Tweetin'
I be schemin', I be plottin'
They be leechin', they be watchin'
She be geekin' off the molly
Call me K, I got knowledge
Keep the K cause I got knowledge
I be drippin', I be saucin'
I be limpin' when I'm walkin'
I'm so fucked up in the noggin'
I be hearin' bitches talkin'
Since I'm always fuckin' eatin' yams, wet the cutlass candy
You know I don't fuckin' give a damn, whack you and your mammy
This is orange, don't say tangerine cause I will get offended
I want Actavis Promethazine, don't want that shit you sippin'
And believe me, I ain't conceited
I'm just chillin', I'm just livin'
And so what if I'm conceited? That's just me but that's my business
Remember I was in a sticky one, reality done hit me
Boy these niggas will make you kill some, they always in they feelings
Nigga what would y'all do if you could be me for minute?
Nigga what would God do if we can fuckin' switch positions?
Aye repeat what you just said cause I was rollin' when you told me
Can't believe what you just said, bitch, I be rollin' in a stolen
A lil' soldier from the Noya
I can't stay from off the corner
I don't care none 'bout these foreigns, I'll pull up in a 'Yota
I was raised in a dope hole, posted on the stroll
Put a nigga in a choke hold 'fore I sell my soul

[Verse 2]
Can't keep these bitches off me
Now my bitch think I'm trippin', got her trynna stalk me
Think before I do the shit, false move will cost me
Got plans for tomorrow, been a man in kindergarten
I don't know you bitch, let me get your social
Got a power, stay in Boca and another on commercial
I would rather hit the fuckin' plug before I go commercial
Stop that Tweetin', I'll murk you
I be geekin' like I'm Urkle
Crackers came and got my uncle and he wettin' in December
I'm a come through bouncin' in that orange, you'll think I'm Tigger
Project baby, grew up in the park, you can call me Tigger
It's whatever, I'll rock a fella, and I'm on a jigga
If I ever meet Erykah Badu, I'ma fuck her
If I ever see you, out in public, I'ma touch you
Doin' me, stayin' busta free, I'll bust a busta
In a busted bus, nigga, my interior peanut butter
Shawty said that I'm a kid, prolly is cause I was beatin' her
Prolly not, it prolly is, really think that I'll feed her
I was in the DMV and I was runnin' up the meter
Settin' trends, goin' Super Saiyan, whipped out like Vegeta
In a stolo smokin' reefer, rockin' Polo in Adidas
Ridin' olo with the Nina, I don't know no nigga meaner




 [Intro]
You know life ain’t tied with a bow but it’s still a gift though
Yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
It’s a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K

[Hook]
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 1]
I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way
You prolly won’t last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it’ll make you evil
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won’t never leave you
The same nigga was hating, I turned them to believers
I done made it through the rain and I ain’t called FEMA

[Hook]
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 2]
I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I’m on MTV
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking ‘bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it’s crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can’t even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth

[Hook]
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K




 [Intro]
20-year-old Kodak Black, real name is Dieuson Octave was arrested last night after an incident at his Pembroke Pines-
Rapper Kodak Black locked-
On parole right now-
And is unclear at this hour what's gonna happen with Kodak Black-

[Chorus]
You my girl, you my shorty
If I call on you, know you fallin' through shortly
I wanna be down with you, baby, like you are me
I wanna be down with you, baby, like you owe me
Is you makin' time for me, baby, like my Rollie?
I want you to ride for me, baby, like my woadies

[Verse 1]
And I goin' lie, I can't even focus
Lately I been stackin' all this paper like it's poison
Sniper Gang 'till I die, nigga, I ain't gonna forfeit
She just want for me to come and paint her like a portrait
She just want for me to put her up like she a trophy
Sellin' white girl, sellin' So, call it Sophie
Runnin' game like it's poetry
Young nigga chargin' to the game like a mophie
She FaceTimein' with a mean mug
Took her out a Punch Buggy, put her in a Beamer
My bitch name Tina but she bad like she Trina
I'm doin' me, drinkin' Tequila, smokin' sativa
I make time cause you my baby
Just like I'm bustin' out a AP
I make time cause you my baby
Feel like I'm bustin' out of AP
Feel like I'm bustin' out of AP
Keep me on hard
You make me go the hardest
Don't matter I fall
Pull up when you call me
When I'm behind bars, I be facin' charges
You the one I call, cause you keep it solid
You know I'm a catch you when you fallin'
Remember I used to have you in the projects
You gone fall through just like it's August
So I'ma pick up when you call me
You the reason I ain't go insane yet
You the reason I ain't lose my brain yet
You the reason I don't stay insane
I'm poppin' out wit' you to hide the pain
I'm poppin' out wit' you to hide the shame
I never need a pill for the pain
You gon' fall through so I'll a make sure that you flyer than a plane
You gon' fall through so I make sure that you main squeeze
I had to make sure you my main thing
You gon' fall through so I pick up when you ring me
Late nights in the Noya
Flexin' in a Jag, hittin' licks in a 'Yota
That's the only reason that I had the 'Yota
She was fuckin' with me, I was with her way before her
When I was kicking doors and I was whippin' up the soda
Whippin' up the soda, you can call me Coca-Cola
She my soulja
You my girl, you my shorty
If I call you know you fallin' through shortly
You gonna pull up like the Marshalls
Sniper Gang land on a nigga with binoculars
Pullin' up like on holiday we sittin' with the chopper
Holiday season we gon' ball like its Hanukkah
I'm married to this shit so sit back and get comfortable
Mama call me Bill cause we livin' like the Huxtable
I just wanna be down, wanna be down like you owe me

[Outro]
Make time like you my Rollie
Is you gonna ride like my woadie




 [Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
All that lil' slick shit, all that lil' fake ass shit
When I be readin' that shit, man
Y'all don't really fuck with me, ayy, ayy, ayy
You don't really fuck with me
So stop actin' like you fuck with me
'Cause I ain't gon' act like I fuck with you
And put that shit on blast
Ayy

[Verse]
Ayy, you don't really fuck with me, so you could just cut it out
I see you know I peep what you all about
You ain't fuckin' over me, I rather fuck your mouth
You just wanna roll with me and soak up all my clout
Gettin' tried of niggas reachin' out and tryna talk
So much flavor, all these haters keep on droppin' salt
(Ooh, I fuck with that)
I ain't even write it down, Red Skelton
Laugh out loud, uh, clown, uh uh
I ain't never go through no heart surgery (uh, yuh, yuh)
'Cause I can't see no lil' hoe hurtin' me (ayy, ayy)
But I done broke some hearts, ask my clergy, B (ayy, ayy)
I'm like how the fuck this nigga in front of me? (ayy, ayy)
I'm like what the fuck, this nigga been watchin' me?
Like how this nigga sittin' here tellin' me about me?
Antoneisha say I was fightin' in my dream (ayy)
That lil' bih Chelsea say I'm fightin' in my sleep (yuh, yuh)
Got three angels on my team fightin' demons
Lil' bih, nigga, I kill, stealin', I be cheatin' (yeah, nah, nah)
Ain't no grim, yeah, but I be reapin' (ayy, yuh)
Ayy, it's Valentine's Day, but I'm Halloweenin' (yuh)
I spin, bend, merry-go-round
Even when I'm married, nigga, I'm hoein' around
I don't believe in karma, that shit is flaw
'Cause I done let out rounds, and it didn't come back around (yeah)
Identity theft (yeah, yeah, skrr, skrr)
That's my occupation, I love to pop checks (identity theft)
I was the first in the ring, a Rolls Royce in my projects (yeah, ooh, ooh)
Don't get me wrong, I love myself, but I love identity theft (ayy, ayy)
They ask me what's my hobby, bitch, identity theft
I be runnin' up that money, gotta take a deep breath
I know what's up, I keep my ear to the streets like I'm a elf
Fuck it, I'm writin' now, iPhone 7S
No, I ain't like you Internet clowns, this a real bulletproof vest
I'm conditioned to the streets, grew up to the streets
I done grew up 'fore I ever went through puberty
I just gave a fool that business with that foolery
Start jackin' niggas and whackin' niggas, first I was snatchin' jewelry
I bag a nigga like groceries
Watch how you approachin' me
Fuck you, hoe, you could leave, ain't no emotions to me
Drop a hoe like a 14
I'm posted up, Dope Boy Ree's
I gave my heart to the streets
But I got a soft spot for my old G

[Outro]
HBK, heartbreak kid, February 14 (yeah)
HBK, Heart Break Kodak, February 14 (yeah)
Touch everybody 'round the country, February 14
Yeah, I'm lovin', and I'm thuggin', February 14
On that coffee and that cocoa, I ain't on codeine
I ain't been on no lean, February 14
Yeah, my trigger finger itchin', you would think I'm a dope fiend
February 14, yeah, this February 14 (ayy)




 [Hook]
I'm so fed up with my niggas switchin' sides
I'm so fed up with these bitches and the lies
I'm so fed up you see the anger in my eyes
I'm so fed up with being sick and tired
I'm so fed up somebody might die
I'm so fed up with these niggas in disguise
I keep my head up cause I'm too strong to cry
I'm so fed up that I wish that I could fly

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I just asked my homie could he help me bounce back
Shit so fucked up he ain't even hit me back
Everything good right now but I was on my back
I'm good though I just had to see if ya had my back
Fam just caught a charge and he took the time and rolled
T-Bird went down, he bitched out and told
[?] caught an L and that pressure made him fold
How come street niggas ain't livin' by the code?
I'm so iced out fucked around and caught a cold
I done ran my bands up I just came from up the road
I'm so fed up of these petty ass hoes
I'm so fed up I'm blowin' kush out my nose
All these bitches want a lil piece of my thang
All these niggas want a lil piece of my fame
I'm so fed up I put codeine in my drank
All this stress I feel stranded in the rain
Got me in the booth I'm rappin' my pain
I'm so fed up it make me wanna sang
I'm so fed up I'm going insane
I'm so fed up I went and copped the chain
Then I copped the bezels, I love the blang blang
And about whatever, I love to bang bang
They so pathetic man you niggas is lame
Ya'll ain't ready man you niggas can't hang

[Hook]
I'm so fed up with these niggas playin' real
I'm so fed up I just popped me a pill
I don't understand what's goin' on here
My co-defendant went down, fucked around and squealed
I'm so fed up I'm loadin' up my clip
All my life I've been runnin' in the field
I'm so fed up I put diamonds on my ear
I'm so fed up I pulled up in a spill




 [Chorus: Kodak Black]
I just pray to God, them crackers don't come indict me
I know if I go to jail, you prolly never write me
I be thinkin' like, "None these bitches really like me"
I be feelin' like you only want me 'cause I'm icy
I just pray to God, them crackers don't come indite me
I know if I go to jail, you prolly never write me
I be thinkin' like, "None these bitches really like me"
I be feelin' like you only want me 'cause I'm icy

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
My lil' nigga trigger happy, wanna catch a body
He even dropped outta school, took it to his hobby
I told him to just do it and don't talk about it
And once you slide, boy, you better hit everybody
I'm livin' like a sniper, lyin' with the window cracked
'Cause I'm about to see out the end
I be chasin' paper but these ladies, they be after me
And every time I talk to one, they gotta scrap a G
All of 'em got a game plan on try to catch me
Think about my life, every night I'm smokin' grabba leaf
I think about my homies in the system
I think about my homies 'cause I miss 'em
I wish you could call me to come get you, my nigga
You miss Christmas, my nigga
You miss Easter, my nigga
You missin' out on your children
The streets vouch for me 'cause rappin' what I'm livin'
I rap the way I rap 'cause I be rappin' what I'm feelin'
Lil Kodak I'm gone

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I just pray to God, them crackers don't come indict me
I know if I go to jail, you prolly never write me
I be thinkin' like, "None these bitches really like me"
I be feelin' like you only want me 'cause I'm icy
I just pray to God, them crackers don't come indite me
I know if I go to jail, you prolly never write me
I be thinkin' like, "None these bitches really like me"
I be feelin' like you only want me 'cause I'm icy

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Yo, my daughter got a nanny for her other nanny
Bitch, I made it out the hood, mother fuck a Grammy
Two mil' on wheels, that's in my garage
Wish Granny could see me now, bitch, I'm livin' large
Trip to Lauderdale, re-upped in Parkway
50/50, make it back, that's what the odds say
Y'all pray for us, we on the turnpike
And if them lights get behind us, I'ma burn rubber
See niggas lose they life, nigga lose their minds
Niggas get to like you, nigga left behind, woo
These niggas love to hate but shit, I love the grind
And ain't no lookin' better, just a waste of time
Long, live, fresh, these niggas ain't right for ya
But keep it real, hey, who really down to die for ya?
All I know is that these chains take a way this pain
Scrapped up in the 'rari in designer frames
Mad luck just hit the last house
My paranoid ass barely got the cash out
I feel like niggas don't want me to be great
Until you're made but they're inside, G's fake
Thank the Lord, I got blessed with some trap money
But the devil got me workin' for this rap money
They tried to stop me livin' good, I'ma die today
Rich nigga from the hood, I'ma die that way

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I just pray to God, them crackers don't come indite me
I know if I go to jail, you prolly never write me
I be thinkin' like, "None these bitches really like me"
I be feelin' like you only want me 'cause I'm icy
I just pray to God, them crackers don't come indite me
I know if I go to jail, you prolly never write me
I be thinkin' like, "None these bitches really like me"
I be feelin' like you only want me 'cause I'm icy




 [Verse]
First day out
Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' fraud finagling and wangling
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex
Ayy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

[Outro]
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight




 [Hook]
You my first love, I still fuck with you
Looking at your picture, you should come through
I don't even want nobody with me in the coupe
Look at all this shit that we done been through
You my first love, I still fuck with you
Looking at your picture, you should come through
I don't even want nobody with me in the coupe
Look at all this shit that we done been through

[Verse 1]
Burn too many bridges, but I ain't burning you
I hope you do good and hope you stay in school
Ain't nobody perfect, but with me you ain't gotta be perfect
Snakes on my Gucci, what I'm watching for, the serpents
Gave you all my time 'cause I felt like you was worth it
Running two door Wraith, I want you with me when I'm swerving
You was with me when I was hitting licks and I was serving
But I ain't gon' lie babygirl you did me dirty
Girl, you did me wrong, did me wrong, wrong, wrong
Even though I love you, I just couldn't hold on
We was meant to be, and then you would've stayed strong
But you thought I was going, I was never coming home

[Hook]
You my first love, I still fuck with you
Looking at your picture, you should come through
I don't even want nobody with me in the coupe
Look at all this shit that we done been through
You my first love, I still fuck with you
Looking at your picture, you should come through
I don't even want nobody with me in the coupe
Look at all this shit that we done been through

[Verse 2]
I'm looking at your picture reminiscing
I'm in this big ol' mansion, now, look where you could've been
When I ask you 'bout the shit, you shoulda been genuine
Tell you the truth, we hook up now, it's gon be different
Tell you the truth, we hook up now, it wouldn't be the same
I don't wanna bring you through no more pain
He was getting money, but that nigga lame
He was in my DMs tryna explain
You my ex-girl so I'ma use you for example
Every bit' I meet for now, I'm just come keep it simple
Sometimes I wanna call you up and tell you slide
One thing about love, it don't ever die

[Hook]
You my first love, I still fuck with you
Looking at your picture, you should come through
I don't even want nobody with me in the coupe
Look at all this shit that we done been through
You my first love, I still fuck with you
Looking at your picture, you should come through
I don't even want nobody with me in the coupe
Look at all this shit that we done been through




 [Intro]
Aye I was just hollerin' at my nigga Cool and shit
Y'know he locked up, I guess he be listening to the radio and shit
He say he be listening to that shit
He say "Bruh I think you'll kill the beat"
So I got the beat, I had to
Look

[Verse]
Stay on my P's and Q's
Breaking hearts, breaking rules
Young nigga stick and move, that's all I wanna do
Ever since middle school, I've been finessing fools
Young nigga keep the tool, toolie ain't keep it cool
They need to free my dawg, I miss my nigga cool
I do this shit for me, I do this shit for you
Only the real relate, I'm hungry I grabbed the plate
Now a young nigga straight, spreadin' racks in yo face
Lil Kodak that brutal youngin', postin' right on the ugly
So if you lookin' for me, catch me on 1800
All I know "Get that bread", don't ever hold yo head
I fell in love with skrilla, I'm still finessing niggas
One foot out, One foot in
Still try'na dodge the pen
Young nigga poppin' checks, wrist full of VVS's
Slugs all up in my mouth, VVS on my necklaces
Out here since an adolescences,  I neva learned my lesson
I'm cool but the block is hot
Two door coupe, drop the top
I got yo boo here with me, I made her drop the top
You sweeter than some candy, no baby bottle pop
Pour me up on the rocks, pour me another shot
Gave me another chance, I got another shot
It's time to hit the top, the crackas let me up
Momma said wait your turn, baby don't rush success
Up all night try'na get it, you need some fucking rest
I smash her then I passed her, just like a fucking test
I pull up where you stay don't need no GPS
Zoe boy from Broward County, I'm the heart of the projects
She give me sloppy toppy, got her turnt up on molly
I need it, I'm staying patient
Stay humble, you gon' make it
I'm out here paper chasin', that money drive me crazy
Flexin' these niggas hate it, cause I just emancipated
Look what the streets done made me, life of a project baby




 [Intro]
Money gave him power and a bigger ego
That money gave him power and a bigger ego
I'm in a Thunderbird, I'm slidin'  wit' my Desert Eagle

[Verse 1]
Money gave him power and a bigger ego
Free my nigga Cool
My nigga we tight like speedo
All my niggas goin' fast, they gettin' Rico
Free my nigga Jackboy we like Stitch and Lilo
I still be ridin' wit' fye, steering wheel on the right
I still be out of my mind, still be gettin' real high
I be on D'useé no lie, smokin' on cherry pie
I promise I ain't goin', that's that other guy
I ain't take no shortcut, this shit ain't come easy
Christian Louboutin is drippin'
When I step, I'm leakin'
Christian Louboutin, you would think I'm bleeding
They say that I'm next, don't jinx me
Eat it up, baby, then drink me
I ain't ever ask for nothing, my momma said "Don't beg"
If you got it and I want it, then I'm on your head
My nigga been hidin' lately, he think I want him dead
But I don't want you to die, I want you to see me shine
I couldn't make lemonade, so I made lemon-lime
Life gave me lemons, so I made lemon-lime
Kodak that nigga that green, Kodak that nigga that slime
That money done gave me power, money done turned me sour
I remember I was rockin' Enyce, now I rock Givenchy
Run up on me, that's risky
Run up on me, don't tempt me
My tank on full, you empty
Smokin' on gas like Wawa
Project Baby, got Promethazine all in my baba
Free my nigga, Flippa my nigga, flip a nigga like Krabby Patty
Flyin' anywhere, my propellers be on aerobatics
All I know is rob, all I know is jack it
I ain't ever had no job, I ain't ever had no daddy
Dress it up, baby, like salad
Eat it up, baby, you nasty
Ain't got no snacks in the cabinet, just some goddamn ratchets
If Cardi be winnin', I'm winnin', 'cause that's my goddamn twin
If Cardi B win, I win
Cardi B won, I won
My bitch said she want her hair done, part in the middle wit' a bun
My bitch said she want her nails done, French tip, London
My bitch said she want her hair done, lace front, no bun
My bitch said she want her toes done, French tip, London
I don't wanna see you cry, momma wipe yo' eyes
I don't wanna do no more time, I want you to see me fly

[Outro]
I don't wanna do no more time, I want you to see me fly

I don't wanna do no more time, I want you to see me fly




 [Intro]
I hit rock bottom
Thought I was never gon' come up bih
For real tho, thank you lord

[Verse]
Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined it
It lil Kodak Black, bitch come capture this
Ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
Cuz I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, totin' my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
That time I let you slide, Imma whoop your ass bitch
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Ay, where them yellow bones? I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put your hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said "I love you?", I was just on that Yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that shit
Fuck it I don't owe a nigga shit
I been outchea thuggin' since a jit
Remember when we was strugglin' in them prick
A nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwing rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothing change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road running, switching lanes
State to state, I'm breaking the bank
Went to BA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here taking chances everyday
Niggas out here wylin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smoking dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place
First I start my day off with a wake and bake
I ain't working out but I be shaking weight
Now my lawyer hollering pay me
Cause I got court December 7th




 [Chorus]
I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic

[Verse 1]
How you came up off of these DP-baggies?
How you get that jag I see you whipping out in traffic
That lil nigga so scrap call him lil scrappy
How you get more money than your damn daddy
Nigga how you fit that whole thing in your jacket
Me and Jackboy we be scheming we be carjacking
Looking for me, catch me creeping midnight with that ratchet
I just linked up with more wheezy in the back alley

[Chorus]
I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic

[Verse 2]
All this money I be making I can't even stash it
And them niggas they be hating and they wanna have it
You gonna' have to come and take it I won't let you have it
Niggas try to come and take it ima' let them have it
Grinding on my mommas porch with my brother mazny
Everybody wit me ready and they bout that action
Why you think they call me Kodak? 'cuz i stay flashing
Why you think nobody like you 'cuz you stay flagging
If i stay consistent with it I can buy an Aston
I got shawty booted up she giving me daffy
Power high fuckin with me, he makin me happy
I just bought a new strap, I'm ready to blast it
Everybody in here with me straight bop-whacking
I can make a millie in my reebok classics
I forgot to bring the poker but i brought the flathead
Bout to make the bands drop, straight pop magic


[Chorus]
I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic




 [Intro]
Nah dawg, this lil beat sound familiar like I heard this song before
Somebody did this shit or something before, I don't know

Said "Bae, your Uber out the door, it's time to leave"
Yeah, fuck it, I ain't even bring the ski
Yeah, fuck it, you can't keep me out the skreets
Ho, you gon' die if you keep pissing on my sheets
Ain't wanna drive so I just ordered UberEATS

[Hook]

But fuck it, I'mma rip this bih anyway
Everybody tell me she a thot ho

Chill or somethin', spend time with a nigga and you keep it trill or somethin', yeah
Shawty there make my head change, I'ma put her in a red Range
She was there when the feds came, fuck her and I made her hair swing
Pull up on her in a new Vs, with the 2-3s and my Gucci

Switch it up and let it fall, yeah, I never stall, yeah
She hella pretty with the blonde hair, I'm tryna get it for the long year

With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee




 [Intro]
In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up

Kodak Black, I'm the truth man

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my socks
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

[Verse 1]
Fuck the FPL, bitch we buckin' all the power
I been doing well since I bumped into that power
Yeah them niggas straight, but ain't no nigga like a nigga from Broward
Running out of mollies so I laced her up with powder
Young nigga, I just wanna lay low and chill
Hoe don't call me Kodak thought I told you call me Bill
You know a nigga clutching got to keep that thang concealed
Nigga what's the point of doing it if you ain't gon do that shit for real?
Damn man, I thought Ian Rapport keep it real
Used to fuck with Carlo 'till he showed me what it is
Can't believe Dieuson, looked up to him when I was lil

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, I had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my sock
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

[Verse 2]
Best believe let it sit too long and it's gon' rot
I seen it comin', once you leave your home we in ya spot
I'm in school, I got a glue stick, filled it up with rock
If I up it, I'mma shoot it, 40 with a cock
40 with a dick, yeah, extendo on my Glock
Cash for gold I use to catch a city bus way to the swap
I done growed up, young nigga 18
Mondo let me hold a 9 and that shit there got a beam
Went on a lil mission by myself, only me
Niggas tryna intervene, come between a nigga dream
Lil JackBoy he just call me I'm like "What's up, what you need?"
Even though he straight, I still sent him something for canteen

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, I had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my sock
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got




 [Hook]
All my niggas switching up
Because they seen lil nigga

Pulled up to spot, dropped my top

Money standing tall nigga
If your money low better get it up

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm feeling like I'm Diddy
Kodak photogenic
Paparazzi panoramic
I just woke up in a Bentley, Benny pop a wheelie
Christian Loub Bentley Benny's Rollin tailor fitted
Time is money so don't call me, I ran out of minutes

Man this here is Prada limit

Did I mention I got activist all in my kidneys?
Boy you better get this money
You'll see why I love it
She be giving good brain but that bitch a dummy

Boy you broke, as a joke man that shit ain't funny

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm fly like Peter Pan

It's Kodak run and tell a friend!
My plug a Mexican, look at Kodak
Kodak coming with that mess again
Nigga Imma switch it up, windows tinted up
Money out the ass, no if and but
Shooters posted on my porch, I pour a 4
Amusement park how my chain swing back and forth
She tell me she want some more, then bitch get back in line
I'm a sniper, pussy boy you better recognize
Just that nigga, lil ol' nigga with that big ol' 9
Man your pockets touch, you paralyzed

[Hook]




 [Intro]
Gotta get up, babe
I was on my ass, boy, I say, boy I gotta get up and make me some money boy, that's all I gotta give boy
For real, when you broke, you a joke

[Hook]
I was on my ass, said "fuck it, I gotta get up"
Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

[Verse 1]
It's the project baby, I been out here since the jitter bug
Swiper no swipin', just been runnin' round stealin' stuff
Bitch, you ain't my daddy, fuck the teacher and the principal
A damn shame, I dropped outta school to be a criminal
I'm different from these niggas, ain't nothing like the typical
And nah, I ain't stuttin' that shit, It's just the principle
I ain't got no image, I ain't gotta keep no image up
But you can call me Kodak, she see it she wanna flick it up
I'm in the field, applying that D, I'm like the Seminoles
I'm in your girl, applying that D, I'm gettin' physical
Nigga think you fuckin' with me, I'm not feeling him
Any nigga run up on me, boy I'm sending 'em'

[Hook]
I was on my ass, said "fuck it, I gotta get up"
Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm on my grown man, I'm just here for 4 bands
Park the stolo at my neighbor house, they called the tow man
I won't bend, ain't foldin', I won't back down from no man
Scopin' and pokin', they hit the cash for gold man
I was 14, when I met the cash for gold man
See me when you see me, lil buddy, stop the commotion
All that talk you doin' just givin' me free promotion
Nigga, if you ain't gon' use it, then why you totin' it
Remember I was on my dick, now I let my nuts hang
Trappin' off my Que Sera, it's the busta bus thing
Early in the mornin', she callin' me, tryna complain
I told her "ain't no love goin' on, it's just a fuck thing"

[Hook]
I was on my ass, said "fuck it, I gotta get up"
Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

[Outro]
For real bitch

Lil' homie on his dick, he 'bout to go en route
He just tinted up the rental, now he northbound
And once he touchdown with them bands, man it's goin' down

I might need a referee, these niggas so foul
If you ain't callin' 'bout no money, nigga don't dial
I stay on my P's and Q's, I'm ten toes down
I just left from out the U cause the Trues out

Just got out last month and I'm applyin' pressure

[Hook: Kodak Black]

 [Verse 1: Kodak Black]
All attention on me (on me)
Is anybody with me, say preach? (oh who hear me?)
Louie V linen to the T (oh I'm clean)
Baby I ain't Christian, I'm street (from the street)
Go, go, jump out cha' seat (everybody)
Stepping through, Guiness on my feet (anybody)
Its coming, I can feel it in me (almighty)
Maybe its the spirit in me (somebody)
I'm spittin', I be gettin' really deep (in my body)
Sinning please, Lord forgive me (forgive me, look)
I wonder, could you even hear me? (could you hear me? Look)
I ain't been gettin' no sleep (no sleep)
My family depending on me (on me)
Addicted to the benjis, I be geeked (I be geekin')
Lately, I been stealing all week (I'm schemin')
Hungry, so I'm stealing just to eat (so I'm schemin')
Even though I steal, I ain't a thief (but I'm schemin')
Shawty keep feeling on me (oh I)
She love me like she worshiping me (It's alright)
She ain't praying, but she on her knees (all mighty)
I'm about to bless her like she sneezed (all mighty)
Together, we Adam and Eve (and Eve)
If I'm blind, help a nigga see (me see)
Cuban link, fitted on me (on me)
Chandelier glistening, on me (on me)
And I pay my tithe, each week (my dues)
Damn I'm really feeling the peace (oh I do)
Maybe it's the jigga in me (jiggaboo)
I put my fucking pistol in me (.32)

[Outro]
Oh I'm jiggin
Ooh ooh
Maybe its the jigga
Aye, amazing grace
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now
I never would've made it
Without you
Without you




 [Verse 1: Jackboy]
Off top, chargin' extra for a rock
Finessin' all I know, that's how I grew up on my block
How you think I filled my shoebox up with knots
Was thuggin' on the block, I ain't wanna punch a clock
I was gettin' bands while ya mans was gettin' hot
Sold my .22, he the reason I bought the Glock
Pop, one false move ya get shot
Catch me slippin', going with a smile like I'm Pac
Just want a bone, I'm a dog, nah I'm a beast
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you tear up the sheets
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you come back for more
I'ma come back 'til you suck me 'til ya throat sore
Aye, aye, aye
Might just make you my bae
Just playin' hoe, come let me nut in yo' face
Nigga play with me I'ma knock off his face
Call Draco and Tae, they gon' let that bih spray
Gang, snipe 'em, bang bang
No drive-by, this personal, hit you close range
If we really beefin' why you put it on the 'Gram
If we really beefin' why you ain't thinkin' 'bout ya man, or ya fam
Can't catch you, they gettin' blammed
Easy to touch you, I don't gotta use my hands
Easy to touch you nigga when you got them bands
Nigga be hatin', lowkey he just a fan
On my block with the Glock, run down on a opp
Was a jit when they tried me, try me now they gettin' shot
Anybody try me now, on God they gettin' popped
Fuck nigga run up, swear yo' life gettin' robbed
Make a pussy nigga wish he went and got a job
Hit his ass with that rara, I'm a shotta
Free smoke, no ganja, Mad Max ya
Re-rock ya for actin', deserve a Oscar, boy ya fake
Real fragile, they be quick to break
Turnin' state, they jump on ya case, trap you in the gates
I know niggas doing time who ain't got release dates
Spendin' more steady time plottin' on a great escape
Niggas hate, guess all the loyalty been misplaced
This not a race but I chase the cake like I can't wait
No more dirt where I lay, so I stay outta state
I ain't tryna rack out so I stay out the way
From the draco to the .40 put respect on it
Aimin' at his head, he might have a vest on him
I'm from the Noya where a donk sit on Forgis
Ya gotta keep a .30 if ya ballin' like Curry
Sippin' lean, it got my vision blurry
Sippin' lean, got me movin' like a zombie
Got me reminiscin' when they tried to hide me
Throw away the key so they can't find me

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Yeah I'm on my grimace, mezanmi
Let the Glock pop and I pop molly
Stopped sellin' rocks cause I love robbing
Whole life you been on the block grinding
Yeah, you just wanna pop free molly
That's the only reason you 'round me
No, you cannot get on my IG
This a selfie, stop tryna get by me
Let me out the cage, now I'm in ya broad jaw
Cool cat, I'm a mut, I'm a raw dog
I know all you niggas thinkin' I'ma fall off
I just took a lil' break, y'all need to calm down
We be strapped in ya city like it's our town
In the field, straight fonk a nigga outta bounds
How you snap a play then call timeout
Blitz ya runnin' back, knock the whole line out
Yeah, once the pressure on, you can't call off
Nigga hopped on the phone and brought the cops out
I don't sell drugs so I don't come out
I'm posted in the cut with the sawed off
12 gauge on me, I ain't pump fakin'
I'ma serve foolie like the lunch lady
I ain't catch 'em dancin' in the cut lately
Trust me, I ain't come to throw no ones baby
I'ma dump when the thump make ya jump, shake it
Grab the pole, strip a fuck nigga butt naked
And you ridin' police escort safety
I was in the gym, now I got court cases
Nah, you don't want beef, you don't want ham
Nah, you don't want me, you don't want nan
You don't ya whole meat knocked off ya cranium
Leave a nigga swiss cheese, rat terminatin' 'em




 [Intro]
I'm livin' like "catch me if you can," you know?
This the amazin' true story of the youngest and most darin' conman
Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Every day a new identity
I ain't talking cereal, but
I got all the tricks
Silly bitch, and I'ma finesse kid
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' for you tricks but some rabbit food
I could be ya professor 'cause I'll school ya
I shoulda been born in April 'cause I fool ya

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 1]
Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be
Please, niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically, locked up mentally
'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 2]
I'd trick so much individuals for a treat
K Boogie with a Hoodie, best believe
It's hot he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up his sleeve
All the nights I had to mask up on the scheme
My subconscious got me fighting in my sleep
I can't forget about it I see it in my dreams
I'm kicking in your door, but I don't want no sweets
I'm giving you what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious don't you feel my energy
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck jack, you get buckeyed back

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta be scared just respect a nigga please
I'm starting to think my cranium got a disease
They be like yo Kodak I just seen you on the scene
They be like I ain't approach you though, cuz you was looking mean
Don't need no friends I gotta big family
I'm a G, it's in my genes
Glock 23, it's in my jeans
You playing freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fling
I don't love ya, I just wanna get in yo jeans
Tricked her for her treat, tricked her out her panties
I can't get romantic
No I'm not satanic

[Outro]
I'm not satanic
Who said that?
Why you said that?
Who said that?




 [Intro]
Like I done did enough time and shit
Like by myself and shit
Like right now, I just wanna
I just wanna be with you all the time and shit
Like every day
Every day
Supreme
Beam me up, Scotty
I don't wanna be alone for a day
I rather be alone with you, bae
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I finally found the one I wanna keep
I'm a thug, but when it come to you, I'm sweet
I'm behind in every goal you wanna reach
If you leave me, I don't know how I'ma breathe
I don't wanna sound territorial
But I need you in my corner
Who else is there to hold ya?
Why should I be alone for?
Girl, I want you in my chest like a flu
If I ain't got you, I don't know what I'ma do

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)

[Verse 2]
Girl, you be all in my head, I'm always thinkin' through
I don't even wanna go to bed if I can't sleep with you
Baby, I ain't take my meds 'cause all I need is you
One foot in the game, one foot in the fed, I'm breakin' rules
I'ma chase this bread and chase this loot while I'm chasin' you
Beyoncé, Destiny's Child, you the one I cater to
Fuck a holiday, every day be Valentine's Day for you
I don't care what my dog say, two-seater, me and you in a coupe
We can't fit three people 'cause this a two-seater
Me and you ridin' with the heater
Gotta keep the Uzi tucked
Niggas be envious
Even though they know we handlin' stuff
But I gotta keep the hammer tucked 'cause even my dogs be jealous

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)

[Outro]
Just be by ourself
Me and you, no one else
Ayy, hahaha
Ayy, fuck with me
I want you in my chest like the swine flu, girl
Tied, you know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I mean? You know what I'm talkin' about?
HBK




 [Hook]
Lord, I be on the molly
I be rollin' hard
Man I'm up all night I can't sleep
I be on that dope
All I smoke is loud
Got me looking like I can't see
I be on that lean
On them xanny bars
Got a youngin' feelin' lazy
They know I'm a star
Steady switching cars
I know why these niggas hate me

[Verse 1]
I'm a dog, here to beat the rabies
I talk before I walk, Yeah project baby
Tote up them 80's, it ain't got no safety
Put down my statement, cause I was stripping naked
Goddamn the beat just stopped I guess the beat is Satan too
And no I'm not no dancer, but a youngin' making moves
If they say money talk, I got so much to say to you
Your soldiers marching up on me, no it's April fools
I ain't coughing but I'm sipping cough syrup
And yeah my car is candy painted, nigga starburst
I'm blowing louder, so keep it down as earth
This molly got me dazey, I ain't talking flowers

[Hook]
Lord, I be on the molly
I be rollin' hard
Man I'm up all night I can't sleep
I be on that dope
All I smoke is loud
Got me looking like I can't see
I be on that lean
On them xanny bars
Got a youngin' feelin' lazy
They know I'm a star
Steady switching cars
I know why these niggas hate me

[Verse 2]
I'm superfragiespadileKodak
I'm wonderin' if they watchin me, on my rollex
?????????????????
Run up on me, with your legs
I pass that dope like a test
Five shots go tween your ol' head
God I'm stupid rich
Got a stupid whip
I'm a lunatic
Foolishness
Please get out my face, you a bougie bitch
I'm the shit
Kodak, I just jumped up out the sewer bih
True to this
Rockin' shoes and shit, Fuck that jewelry
I'm moving slow
I just poured a four, I'm bout to overdose
Stupid flow
Nigga don't know you know, I'm not no average joe
Strike the pole
I will strike your hoe, like a lightning bolt
Panty loafs, on me
Now she lick me like an envelope

[Hook]
Lord, I be on the molly
I be rollin' hard
Man I'm up all night I can't sleep
I be on that dope
All I smoke is loud
Got me looking like I can't see
I be on that lean
On them xanny bars
Got a youngin' feelin' lazy
They know I'm a star
Steady switching cars
I know why these niggas hate me




 [Intro]
Ain't no pussy in my heart
Never ever ever been
All loyal in my heart

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart (To the heart)
These niggas don't know how to play they part (Play yo part)
Never been no pussy in my heart (in my heart)
I always kept it real from the start (from the start)
I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart (bitch give me back my heart)
And if I see her, I might catch a charge (nigga give me back my heart)
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart

[Verse 1]
Damn I got to run here go the narcs
Sniper gang, I hit you wit a dart
I don't do no pillow talkin' that ain't in my heart
I was playin' round wit that poker, you was playin' round in the park
I ain't waitin' for tomorrow, kept it real since day one
Like I exercise, me and jack been down from the jump
I ain't brawlin' man, I ain't got no time tryna thump
Ima garbage man nigga if I see you ima dump
That loyalty will get you outta thangs when you stuck
Around here that sour shit you on get you plucked
I ain't nothin' like these niggas, where the hell these niggas from
I ain't fuckin' wit these niggas, they'll tell on they son

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart
These niggas don't know how to play they part
It Never been no pussy in my heart
I always kept it real from the start

I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart
And if I see her, I might catch a charge
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart

[Verse 2]
If I see her, I might shoot the bitch
I should've treated her like any other groupie chick
I keep my heart pumpin blood, never koolaid
I'm up before the sun, ain't been sleep in 2 days
I told her my name Kodak, she said oh like blu-ray
All these niggas tryna follow me, I went a new way
That loyalty get you a long way
An I ain't never switch, ain't never threw shade
These niggas don't know how to play they role
They act like paper, all they do is fold
These streets ain't for lil kids, get out the road
That loyalty more valuable than gold

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart
These niggas don't know how to play they part
It Never been no pussy in my heart
I always kept it real from the start
I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart
And if I see her, I might catch a charge
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart




 [Intro]
I'm stuck right now, I'm on my back right now
And then I see you, all fucked up and shit
You know heart problems, surgery and shit
I'm the oxygen and shit
(This temptation shit crazy though)
Shut up and take that deep knee

[Hook]
I'm the heart of the projects, hope I don't stroke
Over here we live in poverty, everybody broke
Over here it ain't no comedy, nah it ain't no joke
We just tryna make it out of it, they hanging us for rope
Never choke, young nigga sellin' dope
Young nigga smokin' poe
Kickin' door, jumped right out the post
Ready to cut your throat
Ready to let em go
Project baby, youngin' on the stroll
Sellin' coke, stressin', man we broke
Doctor check my pulse

[Verse 1]
In this a cold world
It's an icebox that's where my heart beat
I'm the last hope for my hood, I'm they heart beat
I ain't tryna flat line, they won't live without me
Golden acre boy free my nigga Greg Roundtree
Niggas played me dirty
Bitches played me dirty
Your niggas and your bitches, they'll leave you hurtin'
I just want a better life, I know I deserve it
The hood on life support and it's real urgent
And I'm fucked up bad, I need a real surgeon
Why they do ya boy bad? I'm a good person
I'm the one who gon' ride out like a derby
If you my nigga imma slide out with you lurkin'
Dye your nose, paranoia I be gettin' nervous
Had to wait the fourth quarter, I ain't have a jersey
Niggas dying everyday can't behave they self
Before you jump off the porch nigga take a step
(Nigga slow down)
I was just a litttle boy, had to raise myself
I was movin' too fast, had to pace myself
Paper chasin for that cash tryna race myself
You know a nigga like to spaz, had to take a breath
Sometimes I think I'm too much for myself
And I done cost a lot of hurt to my health
It'll make a nigga cry, all the pain I felt
While everybody fold up, I remain myself

[Hook]
I'm the heart of the projects, hope I don't stroke
Over here we live in poverty, everybody broke
Over here it ain't no comedy, nah it ain't no joke
We just tryna make it out of it, they hanging us for rope

Young nigga smokin' poe
Kickin' door, jumped right out the post
Ready to cut your throat
Ready to let em go
Project baby, youngin' on the stroll
Sellin' coke, stressin, man we poor
Doctor check my flow

I roll up and I face it up
She can't keep no job with her lil' lazy self
She can't get no job with her lil' lazy self
I be so damn turnt up with my crazy self
I get so much money with my ugly ass
Nigga run up on me, I'ma bust his ass
I might self destruct because I love to spaz
You'll think I'm walking death because I stay in my bag
I'm fresh to death, I'll put a nigga in the bag
I break my momma heart and put it in the cast
I'm bleeding when I'm stepping I might need a nurse
I hop out kill the scene and put it in the dirt
Kodak Black, I never hesitate to yellow tape
I hop out kill the scene and put it on a shirt

[Hook]
Helluva he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are
Yeah helluva, He always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are

[Verse 2]
Page 57 that's a special look
I hope I go to heaven cause I'm not the devil lil' son
I pull up crack your melon and I roll up a blunt
I'm getting this cheese I call it sandwich stack it on a croissant
All these niggas just be capping, just be smacking niggas
I will really clap them like a round of applause
Doing fraud is my advantage I be stackin' them funds
Rapping is my habit I be rapping for fun
You'll think I'm from Milwaukee I hit the SunTrust got a lot of bucks
She think I'm acting cocky I can't love you I cannot just lust
I just lust, I don't get too passionate
Play too many games I wanna whack a bitch

[Hook]
Helluva he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are
Yeah, Helluva he always keep a helluva one

Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are




 [Intro]
Aye
Love just like death, dawg, it change everything
Money, too
You know I remember going shopping, dawg, without money
And I seen everything I wanted
Now I get all this money, dawg, I go to the mall
I won't see nothing I want
I got everything
You too, my nigga, you hatin', too

[Chorus]
First Choo Choo and now you, nigga?
All the hate y'all revealing way overdue, nigga
Ain't gonna lie, I was fooled, thought you was true niggas
I keep real niggas only in my crew, nigga
And none of this money ain't ever new, nigga
But my niggas changed, left me with new niggas
They testin' a kid, I went to school wit' 'em
I'm hangin' with crackers, hangin' with Jew niggas
You wanted a little fame, here it is then

[Verse]
Droppin' hits pussy nigga, I'm a veteran
Still droppin' hits in a Dodge Caravan
I'm smokin' on a pen, I will never land
I'm drinkin' on this Hen', got me arrogant
I'm higher than a bitch, I'm in the air again
And I got the tool up in the Caravan
And I set the stu' up in the Caravan
How I'm 'posed act when a lil' nigga found money?
I lost all my niggas when a nigga found money
How I'm 'posed to act when a lil' nigga found money?
I lost all my niggas when a nigga found money
Niggas better shoot me where I stand, 'cause I ain't runnin'
Ain't no nigga gonna shoot me anyway, not even a dummy
How I'm 'posed to act when a lil' nigga found money?
I lost all my niggas when a nigga found money
My nigga in prison he just called me on the phone
He said that them niggas heard about him in my song
Now they 'bout to X him out because I said he told
And if I ain't save his life, that nigga would've been gone
Even though he snitched I told 'em not to do him wrong
Niggas sneak diss then they go to calling my phone
'Cause all I care 'bout: my kids, I don't care 'bout my future
Nigga if you diss, nigga I'm gon' shoot ya
Nigga if you run up on me, nigga I'ma buss
Nigga if you run up on me I'ma- blood
I'm gon' shed blood
I'm gon' need bloodshed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' need a whole head
And I ain't pay a nigga 6 bands to touch you, boy
My niggas ain't even worried about the money, boy
My niggas do it 'cause they love the boy
And now I do it for free I don't need no reward
And now I do it, just me, I don't need no support
And I don't play basketball, so I ain't goin' to court
See em when you see me we be like a pair
She love me to pieces, I love her to death
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the Devil
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the metal
She love me forever, she made me a lil better
She fly just like my sweater, I never forget her
I'm turnt up in the air, I be on the pill
I took off on a pill, I be in the air
Push a nigga head back, cut his hair
Snatch her lace wig off, she ain't got no hair
Know my momma good and my brother doing great
And my son good
God fucked around and saved me
I'm smilin' with the glizzy tucked
Bitch look like I'm whippin' up
Wrist look like a million bucks
But it's just a quarter mill
If I didn't like you then, I don't like you still
I'm smokin' weed now, I stopped poppin' pills
Diamonds on my ear just so I could hear
She love me to pieces, I love her to death

[Chorus]
Damn, first Choo Choo and now you, nigga?
All the hate y'all revealing way overdue, nigga
Ain't gonna lie, I was fooled, thought y'all was true niggas
I keep real niggas only in my crew, nigga
And none of this money ain't ever new, nigga
But my niggas changed, left me with new niggas
They testin' a kid, I went to school wit' 'em
I'm hangin' with crackers, hangin' with Jew niggas
You wanted a little fame, here it is then

[Outro]
Bang bang, here it is then
Put you on a shirt, here it is then
Niggas getting murked, here it is then
You niggas want a verse, here it is then
All you wanted was a verse, here it is then
But you fucked around and got murked here it is




 [Hook]
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets

I'm not Hollywood, I'm Hollyhood
I don't wanna go to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I got kicked out of elementary
Started rapping, making melodies
Listening to beats on my MP3
Now my video on MTV
I got the BB gun in my bag
Brought the BB gun in my class
Call my momma and she sounded mad
Say when I get home, she gon' whoop my ass
I just dropped me off for 50 packs
I'm the youngest nigga in the trap
I'm the youngest nigga with that sack
Fuck your plug, I got that sack

[Hook]
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets
I ain't never been to Hollywood
I'm not Hollywood, I'm Hollyhood

[Verse 2]
I should have been a president
Young nigga with plenty sense
I can teach a little young nigga plenty shit
All these games, I ain't selling it
All this gas, I shoulda be selling it
Lately I've been really out of my element
These niggas be snitching, them crackas don't really be having no evidence
And I ain't even sick so why the hell am I sipping on medicine
Might get deported cause I be working like a Mexican
I just made a little power move and I ain’t been broke ever since
Dropped out of school, run around finessin' shit
Running with some reckless ass lil niggas we be wrecking shit

[Hook]
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets
I ain't never been to Hollywood
I'm not Hollywood, I'm Hollyhood
I don't wanna go to Hollywood

Man That bentley stretch so long that I can't drive it
Say Kodak Black can't rap he only rhyme when he on them Mollys
You can tell I'm from the Noya don't need no scientist
I be polo to the floor don't need no stylist
Imma whip that cutlass when i blow don't need no rarri

Peanut butter jelly i was stuck off in a jam

[Verse 2]

My pack so stank think my plug came out the garbage
And i can't tell no lie boy I'm just being honest

All these Mollys messing up my bladder
Niggas hustling backwards

I just bought my bitch a MacBook

 [Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way

You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night

I’ll be all day
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Aye I’m booted up out my mup
I’m on my way, I burned the clutch though
I got a lot to tell ya but right now I just wanna fuck though
I love you from the bottom of my heart but bae I’m cutthroat
That pussy good but tonight I wanna stick it in yo’ butt though
I say what I want when I wanna say it, I’m blunt baby
I mixed the KK with the cookie, stuffed it in my blunt
In the cell with a razor blade in my mat
I don’t shave but I hid the razor in my bunk
Pull up and I don’t honk
Hop out then I dump
My steering wheel on the right, it’s enough room in the trunk
I ain’t gon’ bump the horn or hit the horn when I pull up in yo’ front
Hit it on the porch or in the Porsche, kick it then I punt

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night

Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be your night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day

Bag a nigga ass and do the dash, yeah, need for speed
Layin’ on yo’ ass, I’m in yo’ grass, you gon’ need to retreat
Sniper Gang, you think I’m playin’ all them games, you gon’ need retreat
I love you, we can’t get too deep
I skeet before I go to sleep
We can’t lay up in the sheets
Skeet, go back to the streets
Go back to the streets, you don’t belong to me
Yo’ heart in the streets, it don’t belong to me
Let yo’ soul bleed, pour it on the beat
Yo’ heart in the streets, ya soul belong to me

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night
I’ll be all day

Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night

I’ll be all day




 Floating off a xan swear to god it got me dizzy




 [Intro]
Glee

[Verse]
I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They set my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be thirty-one
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Y
It hurt me 'till my heart hurt, they gave him 25
I'm from the Nolia, all I know is slang that iron

[Outro]
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'




 [Hook]
If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Free Lil Kooda, he walk round with that 9
Free Lil Kooda man they gave him a dime
I like when you suck my dick while I drive
But let a nigga know is you really gon' ride
Is you really gone ride, even if they flat all our tires
Be hoppin cars and hotwires, till we get a brand new s5
I still fuck wit lil Robert he knew me since I was 5
Ain't even lookin at yo ass, I got my eyes on the prize
You ain't got lie to kick it, you can leave you can stay
And whoever told you that I needed you anyway
I ain't talkin bout no suit, I'll call a whole new case
I just wrote my nigga Cool like let me know if you straight
You be actin like you real but you know damn well you fake
I'm just thinkin bout lil jackboy it's his birthday today
I might cop a q8 we just got a new place
I keep my heart pumpin blood, all you lil niggas koolaid

[Hook]
If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Keep it real with me, don't know why you lyin
You out here thuggin but you scared to do time
I kept it real with you, I never been slime
They don't know how I stayed up on the grind
What I had to do to survive cause all they see is the shine
They don't see these bags under my eyes, they see the paint on my ride
When I was down bad on my lonely, where was you were you there
When i was lost and i was lonely, where were you, did you care?
Don't be having me out here thinkin you for me when you there
You would hate to see me win, i know you want me to fail
Went to school got expelled, jumped off the porch i was 12
I ain't goin back to jail, no more thuggin I swear
You want loyalty but you ain't even loyal yourself
You a clown, you went down fuckin told on yoself
That's why my circle so tight, cause ion fuck wit you squares
Those cold nights in that cell, where were you was you there

[Hook]
If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride




 [Intro]
Sometimes, sometimes
I get lonely

[Chorus]
I get lonely sometimes
I get lonely
I get lonely sometimes, sometimes
I be goin' crazy
I been thinkin' a lot lately
I get lonely too, you be lonely too
I been going through things

[Verse]
Aye, both my wrists is dripping, but my watch is water proof, yeah
Trigger finger itching, when I see you I'ma shoot ya
I'm thuggin' countin' money in the mean time
Time is money and I don't got no free time
You can never say I never loved you
You can never say I never loved you
I'm thuggin' countin' money in the mean time
Time is money and I ain't got no free time
Different nigga I got seven figures now
I ain't gone shoot a nigga how I shoot a nigga down
Ain't shootin' in the air, tryna knock off your hair
Ain't shootin' in the air, tryna knock off your hair
Money gave me power and a ego
I'm rich but I be sticking to the G code
I know you fuck with me, so do it for me please though
If you fuck with me, then do it for me please though
Yeah, I'ma project baby, I'm from golden acres
Came from Section 8 but now I got a mansion with two acres
Aye, I just might get in and win, thinkin' 'bout pullin' them capers
I'm thinkin' 'bout hurting my niggas, thinkin' 'bout hurting my neighbors
But I don't be tryna be violent, life could be much greater
But they wanna see me in prison, wanna see me on them papers
I get lonely
Muhfucka, I get lonely
Ain't nothin' I can do to keep you loyal to me
But all I wanna do is keep it real
My brothers and my niggas with me still
That's why god bless me 'cause I keep it real
Got sent back to society now I'm riding with the steel
There be too much envy, too much negative energy in the air
And my bitch from Memphis like she basketball player
I ain't go to class, nigga I was posted on the real
I ain't never go to class but that don't mean that I'ma fail
She make me feel good, I ain't even know that I could feel
Got a nigga attention, I ain't even know that I could care
And I don't like to vent 'cause don't nobody even care
I don't like to vent 'cause don't nobody wanna to hear me out
I get lonely sometimes, sometimes
I get lonely




 [Verse 1]
Nah dawg, it's lil Kodak nigga what you thought
I got snakes on my Gucci, but not in my yard
I got that bag got that guwop, bought a icy watch
Shoutout to Convertible Burt
Florida boy, Florida boy, Florida shit
I turned my 4 door to a vert
Can y'all please let me roll in peace, I'm smoking purp
My nigga said if he go to prison, he get the jury gone
All you rappers really be nerds with some jewelry on
Don't be remixing my shit, that wasn’t X’s song
Don't remix my shit, that's a nigga track
When I remix, I re-rock your shit like whipping crack
I drop a seven in a pot, and stretched me ten back
I just pulled a bag out a Cartier box
Pulled up to the dumpster, threw away some bank cards
Road running duffling
Yea I got that laundry
Rolling on a monkey
My car look like a pumpkin
In and out of juvenile, every day we rumbling
Bunky trynna sleep, I singing rest in peace Slim Dunkin
My bitch she got on MAC
Keep her face done
I'm sliding with the MAC
I got to stay with one
Don't remix my shit
Don't remix my shit, you can't ride the beat like me
All you niggas ain't shit, you niggas ain't in these streets
How you older than me, you trynna to be like me
I got that bag
I got that bag lil nigga, I got that bag
Garbage bag, Breitling bag, whatever bag yuh
Garbage bag, body bag, whatever bag get that shit

Coming back racked up Polo to the floor

[Hook X2: Kodak Black]
I Just Might Go n Hit Me One More Lick
I Might Hit the Club and Cheat on My Bitch
I Might Cop a 50 Pack n Bump it Off Quick
Imma Flip the Pack into a Whole Damn Brick

[Verse 1]
I'm on like I've never been off
I'm going in like I never been out
My cousin in the pen never been out
I'm 'bout to make it and buy lil Jr. a penthouse
At 14 saw things that you've never seen
Little nigga doing things that you never dreamed
Ok I'm on like Tray and Loopay
Young nigga say I'm fresh like toothpaste
Kicking it in the Dale cooling in Parkway
My money where my mouth is, let it parlay
I swear you can get money in a lot of ways
You ain't gotta sell drugs to get them pockets straight
I'm on a positive vibe
I had a long day
Keeping my money right, right by the wrong was
Niggas hollering money they ain't worth a penny though
No religion, my niggas worship the semi though
Niggas claim real, they wearing stilettos though
You know I'm married to the money I can't let it go
Wait till send my nigga Angelo home
Other day I was talking to my cousin Bone
He said do your thing, hear you snapping on this song
Told him I love you cuz
Hold your head stay strong
He told me keep it up conversation on the phone
That's what it is, light switch cut a nigga on
I can't lie my niggas going hard with the stones
Niggas hating they thought I was with the Kolyon
No I ain't with the Kolyon, you know I ain't
I fuck with them boys though, you know I get dirty with them (I get dirty with them)

[Verse 2]
My little niggas in Pompano, we get snapping on
I can't play with this money, I can't be lacking though
Even when I don't want to [?] I can't be lacking though
You know little J Black he be stacking though
I was with my nigga Herb in the Audi
So I leave a nigga stretched, Ali Barbi
Money building up like Bob, not Marley
I'm on so I gotta have my cake like a party
You be on some [?] shit, in love with her body
She gon' fuck the whole crew, you gon' say I'm lying
She gon' suck the dick while my lil' nigga behind it
In the club had them hoes whooping like a siren
Get up in the game, fuck it up like a virus
Swear you Tyler Perry, your girl calling me Byron
My pockets fat, 'bout to put it on a diet
Ohh My pockets fat, 'bout to put it on a diet
I'm on like the song
Hope they call my phone
Because before when I was old
Lil' J Black you ain't know
My niggas they on the cut
They tryna' get it up
I get it live like a slut
Tony Hawk, I'ma stunt
I fuck with [?]
He wanna see me win
When I make it he gon' have them chickens bumping like a pen
Shout out to everybody who fuck with lil' Black
And I fuck with everybody 'cause they fuck with me back
In the hood I can't sleep
Shit I gotta eat
Get on the beat
Don't let it breathe
My wrist game mean
My neck on bling
My roster full straight shooters on my team
Had to reup 'cause there was losers on my team
My lil' niggas got pieces like wings
My dog Joey, he be on the beans
My dog Wesley he go crazy for the weed
Yeah he a fiend, still fuck with em' though
And I fuck with [?] 'cause he fuck with me mo'
And I ain't brazy 'bout this money, she in love with me mo'
She been straight, good to me
I can't call her a hoe
I'm going ham, got the bread on top
Yo' ass dead I'm 'bout to ehad on top
My niggas on the stroll, a hundred for the guap
So how you gon' expect to come around with it and not get popped

[Outro]
I'm on
I'm on
Lil Dolph, for real though

I'm from the Nola where the grass don't grow
I'm from the Nola
I'm on
I'm on
And I'm gone

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I told them that the money train is coming, don't get left (don't get left)

 [Intro]
Damn girl, You so fine, I had missed you
I thought I was never gon' see you, dawg
Shit crazy

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
At times I thought a nigga wouldn’t ever see ya
But now i'm back out here and I won’t ever leave ya
I was wilin' with my strap, I was totin' ninas
You know I pull up in the jag I want you in a bimmer
Tell my momma you my one and only girl I need ya
Tell my baby, you my lady, I just wanna please ya
I be pullin' on yo hair when I be stroking deeper
I know you don’t like that smell when I be smoking reefer
You my favorite alphabet, they just wanna be ya
I remember poppin' checks, runnin’ up the meter
I can take you to a place you thought you'd never go
I can do some things for you, you thought impossible
Man sometimes I just be thinkin' I won't ever make it
Cause I be goin' thru a lot of situations
I'ma keep it real with you, girl i'm infatuated
I'ma show you that I love you I will never fake it
I remember drinking lean, living like the matrix
I always see you in my dreams, I love to see you naked
Girl you know i'm from the streets, yeah i'm a project baby
Wonderin’ would you stay with me if I don’t ever make it

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm forever your lil hustler
You so bad i dont want to see you fuckin' with no busta
To see your face again It got me captivated
Keep it real with me what you been doing lately
I need a jump right in that pussy, I feel like a virgin
After you drop that neck i'm gonna drop some verses
I ain't seen you in so long it got me feelin’ nervous
I’m sorry for leaving you, ain’t do that shit on purpose

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Breaking down this reefer right here
I need a beat though ya'll

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I need a beat, i need a beat
Oh this the beat, who made the beat?
Gimme the beat, I'm on the beat
Feed it to me, I'm gonna eat it
She wanna see it, He wanna beat it
Bitch you ain't leaving, I gotta beat it
She wanna geek, she wanna boof
He wanna beef , I wanna shoot
I got the piece, I got the duece
I got the beat, i got the boot
Who wanna boot, cuz i got the boot
I got the juice, i got the lean
Im on a bean, i was 14 going on a scheme
Armed car jacking and i got a sub poena
I need a beat, I need some reefa
Boy this a cutlass this ain't a regal
I ain't gunna beat ya I rather leave ya
If i got to be you then bitch I dont need you
I ain't the one, watch how you driving cause i got a gun
I got the drugs, I robbed the plug
She want some lunch, but i just wanna hunt
Nigga stop hating and go get some money
Nigga stop waiting and go get the money
Way that she looking I think that she hungry
I hit the drive thru and i bought her some nuggets
24/7 im repping and runnin
Boy that little money you touching ain't nothing
How you gon talk all that shit but you runnin?
How you out here but ain't getting no money?
You need to quit it, I gotta ticket
I got a bag, I got the swag
I got the cash, that ain't no cash
That ain't no cash, I got the loot
I got the boot, I got the juice
I got the juice, I got the juice
I need a beat, I need a boot
I got the juice, you want some juice?




 (Verse)
I need love
I'm sliding in that cutlass just because
I pray to God my son won't be a thug
You know I'm on the grind
I don't even get to see him
You know my baby momma
She don't even let me see him
On the track I gotta run nigga
I'm sipping champagne I ain't gotta pop a pill
Wolve stripes in my body, I hit that nigga up
Wolve stripes got my rifle everythin' I did before
No peroxide, but I'm sitting in the cut
With my cousin Popeye at the top
It's just us
I'm jumping out the Wraith
Remember riding on that bus
I shook my old bih because all she wanna do is fuss
I need gratitude, Im on a different latitude
If you run up on me then I’ma bag a dude
Gratitude, and you know I’m straight dumpin' it
Got all the cheese
But I ain’t talking ‘bout government
I was hollering at the jitterbug
He said you wanna rap too
He said you wanna have plenty love
Matter fact he in the booth with me
I don't fuck with E-Murder
He almost died on that 250
But you know I still pray for him
I'll still load up and go spray for him
I don't wanna hit the chain gang but been in and out
I'm 19, but I was a baby when I jumped off the porch
I quit basketball just to thug the fucking block
I was jacking cars going to juvenile in and out
You would think I do construction
I was out here selling rocks
I was in the rap game, but i was still on the block
I was sitting in a cell when Enale got shot
That's my cousin
Swear to God it would have been different if I was out
My nigga Wyjib died, it took a lot not to cry
I was in cell reminiscing about all the times
We was out her kicking door in
We was out here on the grind
You would pop a xanax, quick to pop a nigga top
Call a nigga polka dot we will run up in you spot
Like a nigga tying shoes, tie that paper into a knot
I rep 1800 block, ugly corner Sniper gang
I rep 1800 block, 1800 block, ugly corner
Sniper gang, I rep 1800 block




 [Intro]
Institution
Baby girl, damn, yeah, what it is girl
What it is
How you doing? (shit)
I think I wrote you a letter
Send me a kite back
Send me one back asap (asap)
You know you keep a nigga group
Man, you keep my head right
For real, I like dat
Look

[Hook]
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
What you getting into? Baby who you screwing?
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
Tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
I'm in institution, tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse]
I got to write you a kite, I got to keep it real
I don't know when I'm coming home, thats how I really feel
I know its getting to you bad, you probably shedding tears
You hearing rumors, they saying I caught 11 years
I hope you understand, that it's the life I live
And this what come with a street nigga, girl that's what it is
I'm in this situation, but could you love me still?
Cuz I won't change on you, even if I get a record deal
I'ma rip my heart out my chest, put it in this envelope
They got me way in Virginia, with these Virginia folks
Without my momma and my brothers, girl you all I got
And could you send me some pictures? Cuz that would mean a lot
I'm wondering what you doing? And, where the hell you at?
And when I do get back, I hope you where I left you at
And if they send me to jail, would you send me a pack?
I'm in here writing raps, I'm in here getting fat
But one day I'll be back, they can't hold me forever
Okay now write me back, I'm waiting on your letter

[Hook]
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
What you getting into? Baby who you screwing?
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
Tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
I'm in institution, tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
Aye

[Outro]
If I wasn't paper chasin', I'd probably never leave your side
Aye, aye
Institution




 [Intro: Kodak Black (Man's Voice)]
Project baby, I might need some fuckin' similac
(Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised)

[Verse]
I'm in too deep, your boy deeper than a rap
Imma just let my soul bleed on the track
Check your resume, and you ain't livin' like that
You the main reason why your dog got wacked
I'm only for the cheese, you a freeze, you a rat
You the main reason why your dog got trapped
Before I ever chase her, I'd rather chase the yacht
Street nigga after paper, I ain't playin', Imma snap
Livin' in denial, juvenile back to back
Hit your house, throw all the gold in a pillow sack
Nigga take your chances, whole lives, shootin' craps
We just hit a lick for ten bands, it's a wrap
I'm a section 8, taliban with the strap
Molly Santan, beach sand in my cap
Yeah I could pass the weed, but I ain't pass the FCAT
And probably playin' sleep, cuz I ain't tryna text back
They found the contraband in my mat
I had to sneak a pen in my cell to write a rap
I'm extortin' niggas, want dinner and snack
Told em' Imma split em' if I see em' eat that
I'm vibin' in the booth, I just kick my feet back
She ride me in the coupe, had to push my seat back
I watched my dog shape back, just to relapse
I'm blowin' on OG, you smokin' green crack
I just got a slow leak in my tree wrap
That head got me lockin' up, call her beeswax
Better keep your Smith and Wesson, you might need that
357, E told me "keep that"
Keep your boy well protected like a knee cap
Knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cheese at?
Glock pop, bang, bang, where your keys at?
Don't you say a damn thing, and I mean that
Ran 'cross the power after Cool got snatched
I was on the I, when the coupe caught a flat
That's the same night when SuWu shot Black
I wasn't even there to tell you if we shot back
*Gun Shot*




 [Intro]
Aye
Goin' up top catchin' plays like I'm Victor Cruz nigga
And I'm catchin' picks, I'm catchin' yours too nigga
You ain't Drew Brees nigga, that's a flu flicker

[Verse]
My nigga still be stealin' cars, he love that stuff nigga
He done brought me a brand new car, I told him "Nigga get me a rental"
Like how the hell I'ma tell him chill, that shit ain't cool nigga
'Cause I used to do it with him and I maneuver in 'em
Damn right we hit the scene together, I hit the news with him
But I hit news by myself before I hit the news with him
I ain't tellin' you how I'ma play it, I ain't tellin' you how I move nigga
Hell yeah that's what I do, but that ain't what I do nigga
I don't even feel like nigga tellin' ya kids to stay in school
'Cause I always did the opposite, nigga I ain't stay in school
Maybe if they told me not to go, I probably would've stayed in school
Codeine and orange soda, that's my formula, Ion want baby food
I don't eat baby food, I don't eat baby food
Put a "O" in front of the Range Rover, that's a orange coop
That's a strange coupe, that's a orange Range Rover coupe
That's a o-range rover, that's a fruit
Y'all so cute, get her, she for you, she a swoop
On a boot, 1800 Tequila, I'm litty like Peter Boo
Peter Boo thought she for him, she for me, she for you
No, SG is not a crew, we a team, not a crew
This shit deeper to me than you, you can't even see no we and you
You creep just like them people too, that's why it ain't no me and you
I go peep the truth, see Pooh, he could shoot on the roof, he peekaboo
I say my vowels for the dollar bill, I "A-E-I-O-U"
First thing first is I-O-U, I'ma spray first if I owe you
My nigga in prison goin' crazy, keep on askin' me 'bout his lady
I ain't finna be out here watchin' her page, I ain't finna be out here stalkin' yo lady
And my brother 'bout to have a baby, 'bout to be a uncle and I'm a baby
Paranoid, I'm livin' dangerous, paranoid, I'm overthinkin'
Wrap the car up just to spray it, put it up then candy paint it
I'm a baby with a baby, I done killed so much-a babies
I done kidnapped, I done whipped so much-a babies
If the neighbors hear me, they gon' call the police
Child neglect, call the DCF on me
Child abuse, I'm in the kitchen droppin' a 14
All that night I was ridin' 'round the city to this slow beat
If the neighbors hear me, they gon' call the police
DCF called child neglect on me
Water whippin' in the kitchen, I'm droppin' a 14
Got that glizzy, ridin' 'round the city to this slow beat

[Outro]
I done lost my mind all night, when I grind I don't get no sleep
You goddamn right once they let me out, I'm in yo' hoe cheeks
I think these niggas lactose intolerant, they don't get no cheese




 [Hook]
Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it

[Verse 1]
My mama told me do it
Just can't get discouraged (keep courage)
I'm gonna give her the world
And I'm so determined (determined)
The lights ain't ever working
Got me snatching purses (snatching purses)
I jumped up off the porch
Out here with a purpose (purpose)
Goddamn this world dirty
Whole family hurting (world dirty)
Lil nigga out here lurking
Got my mama worried (worried)
In the studio I'm on it
And I'm dropping verses (dropping verses)
Now these niggas acting like Lil Kodak ain't deserve it

[Hook]
Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it

[Verse 2]
Talking way before the fame
I was broke (ain't have no money)
Yeah when I was snatching chains
Had no hope (still ain't have no money)
Steady wrapped in chains
Jail back and forth (for that money)
I was going insane
Had nowhere to go (for that money)
They calling me names
They cracking jokes (it ain't even funny)
Back when I was lame
Was nobody close (nobody close to me)
Told lil mama blow
Niggas ain't believe me (but they ain't listening)
My mixtape free
But they be tryna buy my CD (tryna buy my CD)
I was out here scheming
Talking to those demons (to them demons)
They say I'm arrogant
Say I'm so conceited (I'm conceited)
You should be happy
I was blind now I'm seeing (ain't shit to see)
Nightmares going crazy
Ghetto dreaming (when I was dreaming)
When I was itching for that money
Out here fiending (I'm out here fiending)
Somebody feed me
Because my stomach steady screaming (know i need it)
Now you want some fame
Coming up you can't believe it (fame off of me)
Billie Jean
Michael Jackson nigga beat it!

[Hook]
Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it




 [Intro]
Yo, I got too much for you. Swear to God, dandruff pulled my wrist, like it's crazy. Kodak ooh flip!

[Verse]
I wanna rock right now so pass me the mic
Kodak Bop right now, throw it all up tonight
Man I swear I kick that thot right out, we ran out of time
I say whatever, however I want, I ain't gotta rhyme
Nigga I put blood on my money, sign the dotted line
Ten toes down, point blank period, that's the bottom line
And I told you wait your turn to shine cause it's not your time
I'm first so no skippin', that'll be out of line
Posted in my yard with my stick, don't get measurized
I can't catch no feelin's, ho I'm paralyzed
So it make no sense to even throw it, girl how dare you try?
I can not rescue a thot, they been (?)
Told you I'm the one, this my second time, get in line
Grab my pole, watch how I pull up, exercise
Boy I treat that beef like hide and seek, I will come and find
Ready or not, here I come, come from right behind
Loadin' up ten hollows, I won't peak, I will close my eyes
Simon says, don't you fuck with I
She gay and straight, yeah she fuckin' bi
You fly? I'm butterfly, I can't treat a trick, sorry pumpkin pie
She love the pipe, I'm not circumcised, but I'm still that guy
I like big blunts and I cannot lie
Go back with my ex? Why would I do that?
Mike Jones, they like who that?
It lil Kodak but you knew that
Get more head than a du-rag
MJ, who bad?

[Outro]
Where my roof at? Where my coupe at?
Designer on (?) true that, yeah I blew that




 I been through alot in my past
I'm tryna stay levelheaded
I gotta stop movin' soo fast
I don't know where I'm headin'
You don't even answer no more
It seem like you want to be separate
Everybody tellin' me go
I don't know where I'm heading
I gotta keep steppin' on
I gotta, I just gotta keep steppin'
I'm goin' down a yellow brick road
Lately I've been turnin' cold
Every day I'm tryna stay 10 toes down
I'm just tryna stay afloat
In that water tryna not to drown

You know that I got an iPhone...

 [Intro]
Ay it’s Lil Kodak
Y'all already know that
Young nigga man
For all my young niggas man
I gotta drop jewels on y’all, y’all gotta know that man
These niggas ain’t really fucking with you out here dog
These bitches ain’t really fucking with you out here dog
Shit crazy

[Chorus]
You think these bitches grabbing on you (but they ain’t)
Lowkey they just be grabbing on your cash
You thinking they be laughing with you (but they ain’t)
The whole time they be laughing at your ass
The whole time they was laughing at your boy
Damnit, what done happened to your boy?
The same one who ain’t trapping with your boy
The same one put the rachet on your boy

[Verse 1]
World so cold, go put a jacket on lil boy
You better be ‘bout that action out here boy
I heard you just be flaggin’ out here boy
They say that lil shit you be packin’ just a toy
I pull up, hop out, Aston with two doors
Why you don’t drive the Jaguar anymore?
You sittin’ ‘round, thinking they laughing with you boy
This whole time they be cracking on you
Getting cheese, nigga trapping with you boy
He the same one go to ratting on you
Damnit, what done happened to the man?
Oh I heard he got locked up back again

[Chorus]
You think these bitches grabbing on you (but they ain’t)
Lowkey they just be grabbing on your cash
You thinking they be laughing with you (but they ain’t)
The whole time they be laughing at your ass
The whole time they was laughing at your boy
Damnit, what done happened to your boy?
The same one who ain’t trapping with your boy
The same one put the rachet on your boy




 [Intro]
See there's pussy niggas everywhere
Gutter niggas everywhere
You niggas 'bout that shit or whatever
Y'all already know niggas about they issue

[Verse]
I was fucking with you strong, what's the issue?
What you wanted? A lil song or a picture?
You say somebody hit your phone like it's pressure
So we'll just fuck it dog, I thought that we was better
What you wanted? A lil shoutout, a lil publicity?
If you asked me I would've did it with no resistance
You made a diss song and now you in your feelings
Runnin' around telling niggas you wasn't dissin'
Yeah, you niggas bout that life, but we more realer
Every time you pull a play, we pull one bigger
Yeah, you niggas 'bout that too, but we some lunatics
Man you niggas should've thought before you do the shit
Tried to shoot a video on my corner but we shoot the shit
If you a bitch then tell the media that you a bitch
I don't tweet, I tell that nigga pull up, bring some food
All my zombies in the projects will devour you
And it's easy to keep the tool but you don't know how to move
And you niggas ain't strategic, and you moving loose
My nigga caught him at the wrong time with the .22
Yeah, he let the .22 go, but it's a .22
I ain't specifically talkin' 'bout you Heffer
You niggas ain't got no balls, ain't got no testicles
You niggas pussy, ain't got no balls ain't got no pelvis
'Cause if you was a man you wouldn't be jealous
Y'all done brought it to a whole other level
Niggas getting kidnapped and getting let go
Niggas only did that just to scare you
To tell the truth, if I was there you would've been dead, bro
And I feel like it's a blessing I'm on house arrest, bro
'Cause you niggas already know a nigga head first
My cousin just got hit up and it fucked my head up
I was ready to rock and roll, come find my heavy metal
I ask my people "Why you move my gun when I went to jail for?"
This house arrest might be a blessing, might be better
What the hell happened to that 187
On another note, you niggas should've knew better
Niggas know we ain't the niggas to be fucked with
But you niggas out here smoking on that fuck shit
Oh, you know we them niggas from the project
Oh, you know we them niggas, we them zombies
And you know we them niggas, boy, we about it
And you niggas gookin' right now smokin' mollies
If yall wasn't smoking mollies y'all would know the deal
How you a Z, but you goin' against the will
And I don't cop deuces, I cop 30s
And I can't believe Bushawn that nigga dirty
Yea you bout that shit you live it but you workin'
I don't care what you did out here, nigga you workin'
I keep having visions about these niggas getting wet up
How the hell you can't tell me 'bout the set up?
And I don't cop no pleas unless I'm jammed up
The only way you talk to me is about some cheddar
I'm swimming in the pool with my Beretta
I been learning moves dancing with the devil
Damn I heard you ain't wanna let the Draco spray
Why the hell you even got it anyway?
I don't even know why niggas [?]
You should've came with bloods, you just wannabe
How you ridin' with a nigga who stripped you out your jeans?
Man how you forgive a nigga who had you on your knees




 [Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And twelve of us, I'm recordin' myself
Fuck it let the beat rock
Just please don't let the beat stop
And you don't even need to knock
I don't care if it never drop

[Verse 1]
Just felt my heartbeat
Just felt my heartbeat
Just felt my heartbeat
Cause I'm heart of the projects
I was baptized on the block
No more orange pop, I'm drinkin' holy water
I could've swore I felt somethin' beat in me
I run away from love when it get too deep
I'm scared to love you back 'cause I might love too deep
I don't wanna love you, girl, 'cause I won't love you deep
Valentine, packin' 9, my lady want a dinner date
I ain't have no time so I just took the bitch to Steak 'n Shake
The beat it got me in my feelings, vibin' to the rhythm
My ears a symphony but I don't show no sympathy
Don't let 'em kill your self esteem, they tryna kill your dignity
Niggas out here gamblin' wit they lives for some publicity
Damn, left my heart in these streets, I left the trick to treat
I'm scarred, lost my conscience to the block, it's feelin' good to sleep
And I don't need no court sentence
I love this beat so much I hope the Lord in it
Dreads in my head and they look like Devil horns in it
All my niggas be up in the business like them dorks in it
Drippin' on 'em, like a dinosaur I be so vintage
Drippin, you can't get these in the store, yeah I'm so different
My clothes and my hoes different
These days I don't know what I'm spendin'
These days I don't know what I'm gettin'
I got blood on my Givenchy
Video vixen, so much bitches, these days I don't know who I'm hittin'
I don't even know what I'm sippin', I just know it's kickin' in
Holler if you feelin' it
Lovin' and I'm thuggin' 'cause they both go hand in hand
Thuggin' cross the country, from the US to Switzerland
Booted like Shaquille O'Neal
You know the deal, I'm on the pill
I just tucked the .32 right in my Timberland
Holler if you feelin' it
That jigga kickin' in
Ain't got no-kickin' in
Ain't got no-kickin' in
Ain't got no-kickin' in
Holler if you feelin' it
At the Last Supper got my plate first
At the Last Supper I got my plate first
I ain't got no feelings

Oh yeah, I'm smoother than some lubricant
Don't go there, cause I don't wanna shoot a bitch

[Outro]

Got it off the ground
They was up
I was low, got it off the floor
Paper chase
Road running, you ain't on the route
Turned up
Like my music, I be smoking loud
Black nigga on that white bitch
Milk her like a cow
Cashed out
They ain't like me but they love me now
Pull up to the floor
You ain't even know
Been cold, fire
Different jags in a row
Pay me back before
Diss me like a hoe
My nigga pay me for a show and I don't even show
I slid by
I ain't flex I just brung it through
Swear to God
If you flex imma punish you
25% on the tent, on a rental coupe
Yeah I'm from the Noya
Off that Ugly Corner Avenue
Ain't gotta tell my shooter, he gon' shoot
Kodak got them snipers on a roof
Whipping with the magic stick then I poof
Project baby
Would you like to (?) swimming pool
Been ready
You ain't ready, nigga getting ready
Time is money
Better have that money, I want every second
You niggas sweet niggas, diabetic
Living legends, jit will snatch your necklace
I'm at the studio fuck a class session
Sorry momma, I will never learn my lesson
I need a calculator just to count my blessings
Finessing, flexing
Flyer than a jetson
Young and reckless
Hit you and your main man and I won't regret it
Switched up
I got a different wardrobe
Designer
Custom Louis V torso
Pop my collar nigga wipe me down
Got it from the bottom now I fly around
Bitch I'm out here, had to get it in
Tell her go first, I'm a gentleman
Go so loud she be listening
Ain't no time to fuck these hoes, I'm a minute man
I'm a project baby I can't go commercial
Cuz I just hit the plug he stay on commercial
Square, not my round
You not my circle
Money got me walking like I'm Steve Urkel
Jump right through your window like a Ninja Turtle
They want my autograph but I can't write in cursive
They hollerin' murder

[Outro]
I kill the beat
I kill the beat
Lil Kodak, he gon' kill the beat
I kill the beat
Rest in peace




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Foreal dawg, I been waiting for this beat for a lil minute
Hell yah bih, Koly we got another one

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Look, I'm tryna stay afloat
And keep my head above  water, you could say a boat
See I don' lost a lot of shit, but I didn't lose hope
They tryna pull me in the system, wanna see roped
But now they tellin' me, "Jit you the next to blow"
I'm comin' up, I got the rap game in a choke
I don' trust a nigga, they'll try to play ya close
Can't be fuckin' with these bitches, cause they love to do the most
It's the white man world, no love for black folks
It's still a dirty world, ain't no point tryna vote
A different president, but it's the shit thought
Ferro should of took the plea, but he took it to the door
I'm tryna make it, but they hatin' on the kid
I got an ice box, where my heart used to live
A nigga cross, I'ma double cross him
A nigga like me, don't forget or forgive
I'm the type of nigga come run up in your crib
Nigga tellin' on you, now you want the nigga killed
Bill keep the steel, I just wanna live, got evicted, so I had buy my mama a crib
I remember when, we was strugglin', shit, I had to move in with my cousin them
I don' see my friends from yesterday, none of them
Now I think about, it used to be a couple of them
Shit I ain't gon' lie, I learned a lot of stuff from them
God damn, I should've listened to my mama them
See the other side and I don' say what's up to them
But he fuck with them and I don' really fuck with them
Sharper than a trim
Jumpin' out the gym
24 Karot Gold dip on my rim
Now I'm gettin' older, now life kickin' in
Told mama look, I'm finally growin' hair on my chin
Mama your lil boy, just became the fuckin' man
I just dropped the 14, it came back lookin' 10
I just popped a bean, now I'm going Super Saiyan
You'll sink like the sand in the game without a plan

[Verse 2: Koly P]
See this the type of shit I live
And what these niggas rappin' we don' already lived
I heard through the grapevine that Kodak got a deal
See we been on our grind since Nova donk was teal
I'm tryna touch a mil
And buy my mama them a crib
We rappin' about this shit we really live
So nigga straight up, them country boys better play us
Mention Broward County, better say us
See we didn't have shit, but a God-fearing mother
You ever see them suds in the tub tryna bubble
Them hoes show us love, but they don' know about the struggle
My aunty died with AIDS and Lord knows that I love her
I remember going broke with no clothes and no cover
Not to mention they killed Wayne and Purp, them my brothers
I been on my grind serving dime to them cluckers
My phone kang wanging and my trap going bonkers
I'm 10 toes down, with a 9 I'll slump you
Call up my lil round from out of town, he'll pump you
Get rich or die trying, so my mindframe is fuck you
Your chain look like mine, I ain't lying, I'll touch you
Coach these niggas crying on the line, call the huddle
And it's fuck a nigga, and my mindframe is fuck you
It's 24 boom, and Polo Pooh he comin' soon
You out of town niggas make room




 It's lil kodak call me KoKo
You know all I rock is polo
I keep the nine call me romo
I use to pull up in stolo
On that codeine moving slow mo
Ralph lauren thats my wardrobe
Shout out my lil nigga dodo
Shout out to my nigga fofo
Ball head call her ocho
Grew up thuggin with the grown folks
Bout that money I go loco
I will hit it up the...
I ain't fucking with my old hoe
I throw money on my old hoe
Why you fronting boy you going broke

That lil soulja he is from the noya
Beating up the pot like....
Pull up in a Jag nigga

Assault rifle in the laundry

All you wanna do is doubt

All this dripping like a fountain
Dead presidents look like a mountain
Drip drip, I'm drippin like I'm [?]
I'm dripping like I'm [?]
I be smoking on a plane, gaggin
Kodak I'ma hop out on a band wagon
Aye I be geeking like I'm book smart
I be preaching like I'm Al Sharpton
I'm so litty like a liquor bottle
I'm so lit they call me Remy Martin
I'm so lit I crashed and dipped hard
I'm so lit I broke her damn heart
I'm so lit I don't know where to damn start

Ain't go to college but I ain't no fool just cause I'm from the projects
I'm bending corners with that tool I keep that what you call it
Bending corners with that wooly keep that what you call
Leave the scenery she break her neck she see me, drop her draws
She say "Kodak you my favorite, how it feel to be a star?"
All this shit just a façade, its Hollywood, shit ain't real
Say bae this Hollywood this shit ain't real
I'm really in the streets these niggas industry they ain't real

These niggas sucking meat for a deal

But my lil lady she from Laudy




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Nah
What they did right there
Nah, let me see that
(Nah, that's just-)
Who that from, right there?
Yahhh, my nigga!
That real

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Just got a letter from my nigga
I grabbed the top and I ripped it
Two pages front and back
I read them and started grinnin'
Wonderin' how I'm doin'
He like, "Lil bruh, how you feelin'?"
Told me shit ain't the same without me, the streets miss me
He hate the situation I'm in, he say I'm trippin'
Just got out of the county, they tried to send him to prison
Just talked to his P.O. and he still facin' a sentence
While he was writin', he was blowin' kush and drinkin' Remy
He lookin' at my pictures right now, he in his feelins'
Just tryna bounce back, but other than that he chillin'
Tellin' me how his dog went down and went to snitchin'
Damn, that shit crazy cause we in the same position
Say he remember them times goin' on them missions
Say he for real, he really do, he reminiscin'
He out there making moves, then get caught up with the swivelin'
Everything going smooth and you just get caught slippin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
This shit a lesson for you breh, you better pay attention
When you get out, Kodak, stay focused and keep spittin'
Bruh, you remember that hoe you was fuckin' with, Lil Vicky?
Man, I hear she fuck with some nigga from Khia City
When you think about it, I ain't seen you in a minute
I hope when I get out we could ride around the city
I'm in Tallahassee right now, I'm with Lil Ricky
I'm tryna stumble across a little play, I'm just livin'
Just do your time and don't be worried about these bitches
I'm here for you, anything you need, breh, just hit me
Your brother just told me you hopped on a plea for three
But everybody sayin' you caught eleven years, G
I'm doin' good nigga, how about you?
I had to send a kite cause that's what real niggas do
You my lil nigga forever, just keep your head up
And write me back ASAP, soon as you get this letter

Cause I got it by myself (aye, aye)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (aye, aye)

[Verse 1]
I'm from the No, my lil bitch from the Dale
I like my money fast, you movin' like a snail
All I smoke is L's, on that paper trail
Can't you tell? I got clientele on my Nextel
I don't need your help, got it on my own
This a million dollar phone, but I ain't got no ring tone (aye, aye, aye)
Kodak, why you keep that thing on you? (aye, aye)
Cause I ain't got no time to play with you
All I do is win, I hate to lose
Got your boo dancin', cause that's what them bands make her do (make her dance)
I'm smokin' broccoli, counting green
I'm on molly, I'm on lean (I put molly in my lean, nigga)

[Hook]
Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (with my niggas, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
Cause I put molly in my lean (in my lean, aye)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
Cause I got it by myself (by myself)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (aye, aye, Kodak)

[Verse 2]
Kodak, why you always in the foreign? (in the foreign car)
Cause if it ain't foreign, then it's borin' (that's a boring car)
I'm chasin' dreams, while you snorin'
Kodak Black, my bitch yellow, but her favorite color orange (color orange, boy)
Please don't call my phone no more, I'm on tour (bitch, I'm on tour)
Only two can fit, fuck a four door (fuck a four door)
Nigga, this a Jag, this is not a Ford (not a Ford)
Polo to the floor, fuck that Tom Ford (poppin' molly)
Nigga, this a Rollie, fuck that Michael Kors (fuck that shit)
I'm in here movin' slowly, cause I poured a four (I'm on that shit)
Got her on her knees, like "forgive me lord" (fuck that bitch)
I remember pullin' schemes, way in Baltimore (remember I was hittin' licks)

[Hook]
Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (with my niggas, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
Cause I put molly in my lean (in my lean, aye)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
Cause I got it by myself (by myself, aye)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (I'm the healthy kid)

 Heart of the projects
Kodak, Kodak
Project baby
1800 block

I was a lil boy, I'm still a lil boy
Can't discriminate me, they know I go hard
90' baby, stay down from the start
And where I'm from the young niggas running yard
Me and my youngis on the pills rolling hard
Getting money, we was on the pills trynna rob
All of us got a grill and we getting guwop
Cash for gold junkie, chop shop with your car
Damn, I feel in the love of codeine
I'm cheating got a bitch on side me so mean
Imma tell my girl I feel in love with your Jordyn
Something holding me back, Kodak, don't leave!
She being down a long time, that the homie
But you change my mind, put it on me
I'd be talking to God, I'd be getting lonely
I'd be asking him why, everybody phony
Said the world is mine I feel like Tony
All night on the grind I lose sleep for it
And I jump out the porch like run forest
How Imma shine when they steady throwing shade on me
She is the love of my life
Black boy, young nigga, hit the chain gang twice
Watching out for the rats in a mice
Trying to get this cake and don't you ask me for a slice
Made my first stack, it was love at first sight
Fake love where I came from on the first night
Is lil chey black, catch me in the back rolling dice
Married to the game, bitch, got me doing rice
Out all night holding on a pipe
Now I'm getting right I'll be holding on the mic
Let me go back, take you way back
Before Kodak, lil chay black
We lost the house and I hate that
Addicted fast money can't shake it
I'll be trying shake that
Momma trying on her own and I hate that
Need to slow down on, where my brakes at?
Got me thinking, smoking gas like the race track
I'll be working that ass, I'll be doing it good
But I've been hurt in the bed
She say "Kodak you'll be hurting me bad
You'll be hurting me bad"
You are the love of my life
Hold the pipe now I'm holding the mic
I do it wrong but I'll be doing it right
She said "Kodak, you are the love of my life"
I told the microphone you are the love of my life
You go girl, you could be my wife
Hey, I've been working that ass
Doing at club but I'll be hurt in the bed
Yeah, I'll be hurt in the bed
She deserves she bad
She make me wanna purchase that bag

 [Intro]
Look what I get
Look what I get for bein' loyal
Look what I get for bein' real
Look what I get for bein' true
Look what I get
This what I get for lovin' you
This what I get for lovin' you
Look what I get for bein' loyal
Look what I get
Look what I get for bein' real
This what I get for bein' true
Look what I get for lovin' you

[Verse]
You got my number, so don't take it to the internet
I'm a real nigga, so I don't get in the net
Kill Bill, I be slidin' with the Killtec
I don't believe in karma, I ain't get killed yet
But I don't wanna die, I just wanna live
Real niggas don't die, we get on the pill
G'Pheral 'bout to come home on appeal
And they 'bout to offer fam another plea deal
I can't even S.I.P., can't smoke in peace
I can't even R.I.P., can't roll in peace
I don't rest in peace, bitch, I roll in peace
I can't even H.I.P., can't hoe in peace
I'm cheatin' on my baby, but I can't hoe in peace
I ain't lukewarm, bitch, I'm cold as heat
Ayy, fuck with me, I'm fuckin' loyal
Niggas kill you 'cause they love you, they want no remorse
How the fuck you put a baby on child support?
I'm married to the game, I don't want no divorce
I set a standard, then I stand on it
This what I get for bein' real, don't it?
This what I get for bein' real, do it?
And I ain't got no heart, so I don't feel Cupid
And I don't show no love 'cause I don't get in return
I don't show no love 'cause I don't get what I earn
I don't show no love 'cause I don't get what I deserve
Took my energy off the curb, put it on the verse
Now every time I say a word, cost a quarter bird
I'm rockin' pony hair boots, this is pony hair
I'm rockin' pony hair boots, this is real fur
And I be lookin' like a million every time I splurge
That's just what I get for bein' real to her
That what I get for bein' real to you
I stepped up out the game, had to step in the booth
I stepped right on a nigga, now I step in the booth
And trust me, I ain't ever need a vest for the proof
And I ain't had no choice of what you left me to do
You made me heartless
You made me heartless
You made me
You made me heartless

[Outro]
Look what I get
Look what I get for bein' loyal
Look what I get for bein' real
Look what I get for bein' true
Look what I get

Fuck up a check and get fly girl

Flexing and finessing then you just like the kid
Damn I broke my code, girl look what you made me did

 [Intro: Kodak Black]
This for ma dukes right here
This for the OG

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Verse 1: TXS]
You're the definition of a queen to me
Mama when I see you I see royalty
When I'm broken, you know how to fix it
You know how to check me with the quickness
Anytime I made you mad and pissed you off
Talking back to you when I thought I was wrong
You showed me how to shake off the drama
I'm the woman that I am cause of my mama
Everything good in you is good thing inside of me
I'm just hoping one day I can finally
Say I grew up to make mama proud of me

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Mama you my number one
Never be another one
Ride or die by my side, even when the trouble come
[?] calamine lotion for the chicken pox
You would even hide the gun for me after lickin' shots
Send a prayer for me everyday, when I hit the block
Used to make me sweep the hallway, then I get the mop
Punishment when I fail, new sneaks when I pass
Only child so I had two feet in my ass
Now I give you the world, yea I'm talkin' long bread
All I want is peas and rice, collard greens, corn bread
Still lookin' good, dead broke or mucho dinero
I appreciate it all you will always be my hero

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I wrote this song tonight for you
Nobody know me like you do
And I don't know how much I need to repay you
You never wash you hands with me and I thank you
Mama you my [?]
You the closest thing to Jesus
Know I put you through so much I hate it
Mama you my hero super lady

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever
Mama you my hero
You know when I'm feeling low
You know how to make me feel better
I know that you got me forever

[Outro: TXS]
You got me forever lady
And I'm gonna always be your baby
You gone always be my mama
Baby girl in the world

 [Hook]
I'm about to see who really for a nigga
If I ain't have no money, would you still adore a nigga?
They way you bend on me baby
They way you blow a nigga
These niggas dick ride me, don't even know a nigga
Man I'm bout to see who really meant for me
Sooner or later God finna send hint to me
And why you questioning me? That's what my bitch do
You niggas stay on my trail, look what this shit do

[Verse 1]
Damn, you and me niggas ain't the same
I stay in my lane cus I'm just tryna stack my chain
But all you niggas lame you niggas just wanna hang
I'm in it to win it you niggas in it for the fame
It ain't the niggas, it be the hoes who really game
And hoe you just wanna fuck a nigga cus my name (Kodak)
And everytime I talk my mouth blang, you know that
Nigga plottin' on you for your chain
Next to me thinkin' how you want my pinky ring
Do a nigga dirty, have a nigga like damn
Your family do you dirty too, man it's a shame
Hoe do you dirty have a real nigga in pain

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm stayin' humble, I ain't tryna have no baby momma
I ain't tryna do no more time, I'm tryna bubble
And I'm so tired of momma cryin' cus I'm in trouble
I'm tryna get her eyes, I'm a young hustler
I lived my whole life tryna get from under
My home boys snake now, he an anaconda
I can't fuck with you no more bruh, I'm just bein' honest
I just got off probation, they mad I'm (?)
Yall be ready to hate, go get some damn money
I was money hungry so I went to Benihana's
That (?) right on my plate, I told her no onions
Now I'm (?)
I be on a paper chase, I hit the store runnin'
And I love to get the money, it's gon' keep comin'
I couldn't never save it up, use to keep fumblin'
I love my brother, without him I wouldn't be nothing
(I wouldn't be shit)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look what this shit do
Man, look what this shit do

Look at you, look at him, look at her, look at them
But look at me




 [Hook]
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to figure out who want to see me winning
I already know resentment brings envy
I'm a business man I'm a fucking business
So I can't be up in the penitentiary
And I just wanna be able to tell who really with me
Is she for me or is she just playing with my feelings
And I don't want to but I gotta switch up
Cause you niggas want to have me locked up in the system
Even though that's who I am I gotta change my life
I'm getting so much money now I can't be slinging iron
And girl when we hooked up you said you gon ride or die
So I'm assuming that you dead cause you damn sure ain't riding

[Hook]
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me

[Verse 2]
I went to jail twelve times I'll never go again
Even though I said the same thing my other bid
Everybody stopped fucking with me cause I keep going in
And I'm feeling like Ben Franklin my only friend
Cause that nigga kept it real stayed in my pocket
He was with me when y'all weren't fucking with me in the projects
Is you in it for the fame or do you really like me?
It's hard to tell when I got five mill in the Breitling
I know you don't want to but you gotta change your surroundings
Cause them niggas don't want to change all they know is violence
I'm a sniper you know all my niggas move in silence
I'm trying to balance out my life I'm doing mathematics

[Hook]
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me




 [Intro]
All I got is me, myself, and I, yeah
Yeah, babe, me, myself, and I
Section 8 Taliban, yeah

[Verse]
All I got is me, myself, and I, got myself again
Time is money, I need that money, got no time for no friends
Ain't nobody gon' ride like me, cause I'm gon' ride to the end
Been in fucked up situations, where you niggas would bend
Play my cards, I never bluff, and I ain't throw in my hand
Shit, I saw when times got hard, I watched my nigga renege
He snitched, we caught that charge, I can't believe what he did
Cause he knew what we was doing before we went on that lick
I been rapping and snapping, I fell in love with this shit
It caught up with me, cause I be jacking since I was a litting kid
I been trippin' and goonin', and throwing rocks at the pen
All that sticking and moving, it got me doing a bid
Look, nobody gon' keep it real how I be keeping it real
Coulda snitched and got released, you know they offered a deal
Put myself in tight positions, I can't even regret em
I was scheming, times was hard, and I just needed some cheddar
My life a movie, it's Kodak, I'm the movie director
Sometimes it can scary, but I know it's gone get better
Remember when it was my people, them was gon' send me some letters
Cause I was missing my bitches, and I was missing my fellas
Hot pocket on me, so my pants keep fallin'
They wanna take me out the game, but I just keep on ballin'
Polo'd down, pop my collar, little nigga shot callin'
Could just hold up for me on the other line, guap calling
I'll get back to you later, I'm rollin' out of my tater
I been leaning so damn much, and now it got me disabled
Niggas grimey', be conniving', do shit under the table
Just last night, John John got yoked by the raiders
Fucking 'round on the ugly, hit that boy with a taser
Once I came out the womb, I jumped straight to teenager
They say I'm a demon semen, young boy, hell raiser
If I ain't pullin' up in a foreign, then I'm pullinga caper
Project baby paper chasing, tied, they dead flies
Institution
Run up on me, send you straight to your maker
All that kush that I be smoking, you think I'm from Jamaica
But hell nah, I ain't from Jamaica, bitch, I'm from golden acres
And I'll tag you with that 9, and that bitch got a laser
And I'll lay a nigga down, I'm like "fuck nigga, pay me"
I ain't baking, but I'm caking, I should open a pastry
I got dope in the basement




 [Intro]
It's like fuck it, I'm just misunderstood
That's the story of my life

[Hook]
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family

[Verse 1]
I keep this tool on me like I done turned into a mechanic
I'm a fuckin' CEO, I don't need no damn manage
I don't like no interviews, see y'all don't speak my language
We can't hold no conversation, you don't know what I'm sayin'
She say she wanna know the real me, bitch I am it
Tell the blog "correct that shit," 'cause I ain't from Miami
I don't even speak code, when I do, I'm misinterpretated
I don't even need no surfboard, I'm too fuckin' wavy
I ain't take my meds bitch, 'cause I ain't fuckin' crazy
Say you thuggin' a lil' too hard, life you livin' dangerous
They don't see potential, they say I'm a project baby
Just 'cause my dad so goddamn selfish, he ain't wanna raise me

[Hook]
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family

[Verse 2]
I'm on 18, I'm slangin' like I'm Peyton Manning
My bitch just told me to be more gentle 'cause I'm too demanding
They say that all my demons seeming, but I'm not satanic
And I keep her back wet but shawty ain't Hispanic
I see you in peripheral vision through my Prada lenses
No point in goin' to school if I'ma keep on jumpin' fences
The block too hot and that's the only reason I'm on campus
It's a pandemonium ridin' panoramic
Once they let me out of jail I went back to the dentist
I snapped my golds out and flood my gums with VVS's
Yeah, you listenin' what I'm sayin' but you don't get the message
Did so much dirt I wonder how I still be gettin' any blessings

[Hook]
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family

Money over bitches
Mind over matter
Sliding base
Run up in your home
Hey batter batter

Getting to the loot
Hitting licks

Grew up in them bricks
Ain't have a pot to piss

Stick and move

I'm rolling off a hill
Call me Zephyrhills
[Hook]

[1ST Chorus]
Turn on the lights cause I'm looking for Molly...Molly, Golden one they say Im the chosen one

Ima park that bitch in front of the ugly corner
Ima wrap that cuban link around my neck, in the fast lane say slow down for you wreck Im gone bend the corners and im gone make a mess, ima bend the corner and im gone make them stress

Put the rocks all on my ears, watch them cry them tears when I switch them gears

[2ND Chorus]

 [Intro]
My cousin just text me and shit (Yeah Free BG, rest in peace [?])
He said, "I just got wet up sitting in my car this morning Cuzzo
I got hit one time but I'm good though (free all my Sniper Gang niggas), just letting you know before these niggas kill me
I love you to death and forever. Let me live on as a real sniper

[Chorus]
My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though

[Verse 1]
I'm in the studio right now, I'm on album mode
I wanna get suited up and tooted up on sniper mode
Every time a nigga get focused, it be some fuck shit
It throw me off my pivot and make me get on my thug shit
Last year my cousin got hit up and got kidnapped
I wasn't even there but you know a nigga handle that
Hit him up again this year and I ain't feeling that
I'm throwed right now cause I don't know where my feelings at
I don't know if I wanna rap or want to pop a cap
But I know you niggas want to see me go right back
But this sniper gang shit in me, I'm living like that
You niggas about to make me relapse, I'm feeling like that

[Chorus]
My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though

[Verse 2]
Soldier-like mentality, going through these tragedies
Don't wanna see me happily, rather see me raggedy
They don't wanna see me get a bag, they wanna bag a G
But I go on a clappin' spree and murk ya whole family
I guess a nigga kept it too real, that's why they mad at me
Sitting back thinking right now, I'm smoking Grabba Leaf
Nigga went from wearing baggy jeans to dressing casually
From being on the newspapers, now I'm on magazines
I'm chopping it up with Master P, told me keep God first
We doing venues now, selling out concerts
I'm trying to keep a tunnel vision, trying to see it his way
But I got blood in my eyes, I'm tired of seeing this way
I can't even sleep skraight, even on the Tempurpedic
Why I'm still going through it? Why I'm still fighting demons?
Niggas call you pussy when you focused and avoiding shit
We getting this money for no reason, nigga trying to enjoy this shit
I got a lil' boy and shit, and I don't wanna leave dude
Cause they'll trick him like they did me, that's what these skreets do
Niggas out here playing gangsta and playing police too
I seen the paperwork and that's why they don't kick it like we do
That's the same reason you couldn't come home to seafood
Been moving funny but a nigga just couldn't read you
Beat was been over with, looped it cause I love this beat
Looting for my cousin and my niggas who in custody
I'm feeling like its my fault, feel like it's because of me
Was tryna soak the industry, I already thugged the streets
Did my thing a couple nights, I already earned my stripes
Deeper than rap, they fucking with me cause I'm about that life
You know I'm head first, Big Cuz, that's why you called me man
But if I go to jail again, my mama she gone wash her hands
I'm innovating how to play it but it's still a slim chance
Cause you will sink in the sand in the game without a plan

[Outro]
Aye I swear to God cuz when you called me dog
And you told me that shit dog I said fuck everything
House arrest whatever, you know what I'm saying? I went to looking for my AR I couldn't find it you know what I'm saying
You know I fuck with them AR's and shit
Dracos too heavy and shit
Draco's get too hot
That AR got the coolin' center, the heat sensor, know what I'm saying with the scope with the crosshair
And shit I guess it wasn't meant, dog




 [Intro]
(Plugoz on the beat and I'm killin' it)
Damn who make this beat, 'cause I'm stealin' it

Sniper Gang, John Wicks

[Verse 1: John Wicks & Kodak Black]
Thinking when I ain't had shit

Remember when I had to hit a lick
Now I'm flashin' on these niggas, take a pic
Look baby, I ain't got no time for this

All this flavor, I be saucin' on a bitch
All this flavor, I be droppin' when I drip
Sniper gang, we mobbin' in this shit
I'm leakin' like a faucet on the wrist

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik

[Verse 3: Jack Boy & Kodak Black]
Been goin' hard, think I need to rest up
Been goin' hard, 'cause really I'm like next up
Ran up that bread, fuck niggas can't catch up
Run up you dead, we spray you from the neck up
Keep yo' two cents, you broke, fuck yo' lecture
Don't want pressure, my snipers goin' extra
Don't you test us, like teachers we give lessons (Yeah, baby)
Cross 'em out, Sniper we gon' X 'em
Hey Jack Boy, this her first time ridin' in a foreign car
Ay, but she just don't know that it's a stolen car
Switch the VIN number, now this shit here mine now
I'm on house arrest, but I still be ridin' around
And I can't wife ya up, I can't be tied down
I put the lighter up, but I can't put the fire down
Just bought a AP, went lit up my wrist gang
G1 taught me right I got that whip gang
The industry they hit a lick on Biscayne
Fuck the industry I'm in the streets for real mayne
I'd like to stick around niggas say they in the field 'til they get blitzed

[Hook]
Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik
You can't spark my flam now I'm lit
I might snatch ya' chain and ya' bitch




 [Hook]
My Fendi belt is buckled where my pistol is

I gotta get it, bitches don't mean shit to me
(Fuck that bitch)
I failed history, now I'm making history
(Fuck that class)
Lil nigga got that bang, I feel like Hilary

I'm on a mystery
Wait, I don't think they feeling me
This the life of Kodak
It's a mystery

[Verse 1]
My life a mystery, I'm a scavenger
I ride all up on the beat, don't need no passenger
My girl from Africa (?)
I'm rolling Cali bud
I smoke extravagant
You niggas characters, I'm talking Dr. Seuss
I wear binoculars when I jump in my coupe
My belt cost more than you
I got more bells than school
No, I can't love you boo because that's not what I do!
Finessing like a fool, I keep a strap or two
Got nothing for you silly tricks but some rabbit food
These streets is serious
Yeah, I'm mysterious
My swag ridiculous Kodak, just get it up

[Hook]
My Fendi belt is buckled where my pistol is

[Verse 2]
My nigga George, he acting monkey, call him curious
I jumped in my whip just like Fast and Furious
I'm rolling cannabis, I'm pouring activist
I'm finessing, taking trips, I live adventurous
Boy who you think you is
You think you is that nigga
Goddamn lil buddy broke
I should've just hit that nigga
I'm swimming in that money
Nigga cry a river
Who told her she a dime

I killed the beat, ooh she gon' kill me back
I left them flow ass niggas
Got my money right
My swagger mean
But I ain't nothing nice
I'll headcrack a nigga like (?)

My Fendi belt is buckled where my pistol is

 [Intro: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah (Kodak)
Yeah, yeah (You know dat)

[Chorus: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm tryin' not to get locked up back again
Had to take a lot of losses just to win
I was young, jumped in that water, been swimmin' ever since
Then I drowned, I never noticed how deep that I went
Head first, ain't waste no time, I dive right in
And life's a bitch, she spread them legs, I slide right in
This ain't a game, I'm runnin' 'round eatin' like Pac-Man
Fuck the fame, I knew I was a star since back then
Way back then, was gettin' them chips like Low-So
I think I'm way before my time, say I got a old soul
With the grown folks, shootin' dice by the dope [?]
I got ice runnin' through my veins, my heart just so cold

[Chorus: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
It's a shame how much pain I brought my mama through
I just want to get her a new Range, maybe one or two
Me and all you niggas ain't the same, I ain't one of you
Homie you a lame, you can't hang with this money crew
Lately I ain't been gettin' no sleep, I'm just [?]
One day you'll wake up and your dream right in front of you
How you tellin' all your homies you can't even tell time?
They been sleepin' on the kid, it ain't even bedtime
I been goin' hard, I'm on the grind, ain't no spare time
And I keep the tool in the trunk like a spare tire
Way back, hittin' licks with my clique spazzin' out
[?] cashin' out

[Chorus: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

[Outro: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind

[Verse 1]
You might not understand this girl
This might actually be the best thing for us
We keep arguing every day boo
Eventually you gon' make me hate you
Me and you ain't got the same view, girl
You don't see that it's a great move, girl
It ain't gon' break you it's gon' save you, girl
'Cause I've been feeling like I hate you, girl
It's like you ain't got no faith in me
'Cause lately you've been irritating me
I don't want to drive you crazy
I'd rather drive Mercedes

[Hook]
Baby it ain't you it's just me I need a break

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Picture me, riding in the two seat faded
When I came from the hood where most
Niggas don't make it
Kodak Black, Molly caps
With a Asian model feeding me grapes
Now picture that imagine this
Panamera Jim Carrey sheraton hotel
My bitch dipped in mascara Oooh
Foreign ride me and Polo poo in the Coupe
Top back, only two seats
Used to mask up lace my sneaks
Now round Tables f.b.g have a feast
Grew up in these streets
Turned the kid into a beast
Tryin' to get this meal, we gon' eat
Pull up in the hood giving shit to the kids
So they don't have to rob for it, like I did
Blowed basketball, AAU
You got me fucked up
I'll blow this rap shit too
They said I won't make it, my pride you can't take it
I won't fake it till I make it
Shouts out to Tribulation
That ain't break me either
Close friends acting strange that can't break me either

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Never Imagine this cause I ain't have a pot to piss
Or a window to throw it out of
But picture this
At the top from the bottom
Even though they doubt us
[x2]

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
They doubted me
Said I'm gon' blow it, ain't tryna blow it
My pain I never show it
They want my spot I know it
Said I was gon' be in that County Jail
15 cold cell, no bond, no bail
God sent the train I ain't jump on his trail
And I know Purp And Wayne watching us down here
Thinking to myself like there's God out there
But I got to thank him
Cause i'm still out here
Never thought of me, big offices
The same jit used to run from them officers
Came from the ugly corner to the spotlight
Let my niggas flex to get my spot right
Free bands, finesse plans
Willie in my mama kitchen whippin' like a chef chem
Pyrex pots he good with his left hand
Def jam, even the deaf jam
Even the deaf hear him, even the blind see him
The paralyzed feel him, nigga onomatopoeia
T-Burn snitched he got him a deal nigga
Once I get my deal nigga, it's gon' get real nigga
Yeah I'm a real nigga
I just wanna live nigga
Can't take no losses
I'm a lil nigga
Paranoid pop a nigga like a pill
Nigga keep my lil seal nigga
Imagine when I get a deal nigga

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Never Imagine this cause I ain't have a pot to piss
Or a window to throw it out of
But picture this
At the top from the bottom
Even though they doubted
[x2]

[Verse 3: The Kolyons]
Somebody call the paramedics
Life done gave me all this pain and ain't came with anesthetic Thuggin' graveyard where i'm heading
We busting and fucking over niggas
Dawg I don't regret it, they deserve it
I can take it I ain't havea pot to piss in
I had a pop when he was always sick
And I was outchea trying to fit in
I'm fucking with these niggas from a distance
I rap but you niggas pay attention
A gun is my bestfriend
Father God won't you send me a blessing
From robbing now I'm rapping, It's destined
Section 8, I swear to God it gets treacherous
Only reason that my mama been stressing
I've been up against the odds
Even when it's dark
Even when it's raining and [?]
Even when it's hurting ain't no sense in me complaining
Cause it's destined
We gon' make it




 [Intro]
Ay boy you don't need no more of that oil boy, that's another lick for you boy. (?) you be throwed off that random boy, murk him off that oil

[Verse]
He was just steppin' out to the little party
End of the night ended up with a body
Big booty bitch way bigger than Mizhani
While he eat kool with the whip like Desiigner
While I hit the top then go back to the bottom
Now I got a lil one, I shoulda wore a condom
But now I'm happy I didn't wear a condom
Cause that lil nigga right there my blessin'
Two days after I lost my grandpa
Sam took me to go take that test
And it came back mine
That boy mine, the beeper say 99.9
How you gon' pull up and crash the party?
I'll put the slug in your ass little boy
How you gon' steal from your lil nigga?
How you gon' act like I wasn't with ya?
I can do everything by myself
But I ain't gon' be outchea askin' for help
How the hell you gon' act like a housewife
When you know everybody know you a thottie
Got me a pistol, I got me a shotty
I be posted up in the yo like Gotti
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
Every time he step out he booted
Every time he step out it's a movie
Tottin' a toolie, I'm rollin' a doobie
I'm stickin' and movin', I'm burnin' and lootin'
Ain't got time for you lil niggas
Ain't got time for you lil bitches
Show me you different, show me you different
Show me you different girl, show me you different
How you gon' act like I wasn't there
How you gon' act like a nigga ain't care
I was on 1800 block all day
Nothin' was easy, had to get this shit the hard way
But I maintained, never complained
I'm true to the game, ain't never been a lame
Nigga I crewed up when I was nine
Got me a street, fell in love with the grind
I love the hustle
All the dark nights I sacrificed, it only made me tougher
All of the trials, it made me wild
And tribulations, it made me wise
Tell my child don't fuck with them guys
When you from that side, won't fuck with them guys
I can't deny he got my eyes
I can't deny cause I'm not that kind
He don't even cry but he prolly might whine
I'm on the school bus sellin' dimes
Why you gotta wish bad on your little woadie?
Put your ass on now you actin' all spoiled
Why you gotta talk down on your little homie?
Grandpa dropped middle of the testimony
Grandma died, guess he was gettin' lonely
Why I go HAM? Cause I don't eat baloney
Nigga you a phony, how you gon' act like you real?
How you gon' act like you trill?
Why you got the flag? A nigga already know the deal
How you gon' turn around and squeal?
Look at me leanin', I'm poppin' the seal
Look at my lips as I'm poppin' the pill, damn
Everybody acting like they my people
I don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you neither
Woke up today and I copped a new beemer
Cuz a nigga got tired of the two seater
I don't hear evil, I don't feel no evil
But I still walk around with the Desert Eagle
I just got me a referral from the teacher
Bitch I'm a zoe, I don't do pledge of allegiance
Fuck you lil ho, lock my door if you leavin'

[Outro]




 [Intro]
Of course I wanna see you make it
Shit, only if you taking me with you
Shit, If you ain't taking me withcha now I don't know
Shit...

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't want to see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I don't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no codefendant
All 'cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't want to see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I don't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no codefendant

[Verse 1]
I'm on posted on the Ugly, I'm outcha in the open, wit it
I'm on that Zoe shit, ain't no hoe shit, ain't no folding in me
I got like four lil bitches on here, That one with no Jimmy
I ain't wear no suit and tie right now but I give the nigga the business
I should've killed my cousin that night 'cause he was my only witness
But I ain't kill him 'cause I love that nigga till infinity
And If I buy a house, you feel like you deserve to live in it
And If I buy a car, you feel like you deserve infinity
How the fuck you feel like that, when you weren't ouchta here with me getting it
You wasn't even at my sentencing
I was in a fucked up predicament
Oh you don't love me no more?
I ain't your brother no more?
'Cause I don't give you nothin' no more
I ain't your brother no more

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me making no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant
Oh 'cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant

[Verse 2]
You ain't have to eat grits, 3 in the morning
You ain't have to sleep with a nigga on the toilet
I was wearing Paul Wall, you was wearing Jordans
All that bullshit, I'm trying to avoid it
I ain't ask you when you had your shot
I ain't ask you when we got kicked out
I ain't ask you, I was posted on the block
I was doing fraud, I was going up top
I was eatin' peanut butter
Nigga how you got my number
I don't really owe nobody
Matter fact I don't know nobody
Matter fact nigga leave me alone
I ain't tryna get out my zone
I ain't tryna get out my bubble
I ain't on that shit you on
I don't wanna relapse on niggas
I better not wack me a nigga
I'm just tryna rap these songs
So let me just rap these songs
You ain't take me when you had your time
You ain't take me when you had your shine
Why when I'm focused y'all saying I got changed
It's like y'all wanna see me in them chains

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me making no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant
Oh 'cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant




 [Intro]
Yeah I said so, so who drove him?
That shit crazy, man
Who drove him to the hospital?
Cause I'm in here trying to make a love song and shit
Like I get this bad news

[Verse]
I just got the call before I heard the beat
They just shot my dog like why it had to be
But it ain't getting to me, cause nothing can't get to me
Cause that's what the streets owe us, the world gon' keep going
I'm really disappointed but a nigga gone keep focused
It's like he already told me, it's like he had a warning
But it come anyway, even if that heater on him
Ain't gotta creep up on him cause I gotta feed the soldiers
I don't know when I'm finna reap what I sow
So baby show me all your love before I go
This wasn't supposed to be no thug song bae
This was 'posed to be our love song bae
Got me thinking bout getting my gun and going bae
Got me thinking about putting my gloves on wait
I be getting in that pussy without no glove on, wait
I'm raw dogging now I will never go stray
I got a lot to say but I don't know where to start
I might break off from a nigga but I won't break your heart
At least not on purpose, now you can't even hurt me
I done took so much pain, now I just endure it
I don't even need a perky, this shit isn't gon' even be working
Two extendos let one go pop in another 30
I done fucked up and got into deep thuggin
You the one, the one that made me feel something
My intention was to get in the booth and start singing
But once I walked inside the booth my phone started ringing
Ain't answer cause I'm trying to vibe and talk to my lady
Lemme put you on hold real quick, man you niggas talking crazy
Like why you calling me? I'm trying to do RnB
But now I gotta mix it up, I'm holding two conversations
Don't you know this album's 'posed to be for all the cuties
Now you calling me, got me in here talking 'bout a shooting
Fuck it leave him clueless, I don't like to express myself
Fuck it he ain't do it and I know that very well
Yeah, once I got a call I got the beat too
I couldn't finish the song and I couldn't go to sleep too
Went home my brother told me something else, they creep too
That shit deep too, threw me for a loop
I done got exposed to the life way too young
I ain't paralyzed but the street done turned me numb
Like nothing gon' even move me, but baby you make me run
I'm talking murder music, and make you fall in love
I'm heartless but I save you a piece
Hold up bae don't hang up got somebody calling me




 [Intro]
Damn that's so sad
K-K-K, K-K-K

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass

Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the pole at, where your clothes at?
I ain't talking 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all tripping, too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skipping in the hallway, I was skipping school
On my Ps and Qs,  on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleeding concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you, so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissing on nobody B, I'm vibing on the beat
Honestly, I'm just trying to be, I just gotta be
Trying to get over on anything, they telling lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't getting on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you falling off your feet
I will trick your ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play for, call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Milds with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You getting skinny, I'm getting chunky, getting money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds, hundreds




 [Intro]
Haters so sad
KKK, KKK

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got new money, I got new hundreds

Toolie go to thumpin', jump out busting, foolie go to running
Boy don't play with me, I don't play with kids, better go to school or somethin'
Boy don't play with me, I don't play with kids, little nigga, I shoot for fun
Money moves, these bloody shoes, I'm trippin' Christian Louboutin
Excuse me son, I beg your pardon, get from 'round me, smoking flocka
This is draco, this a baby choppa, I've been so angry doctor
Drop 8 ounces in my baby bottle, baby bottle pop!
I don't Nae Nae, I don't milly rock, baby I just Kodak Bop, I don't do no flock'!
I don't really do no feature, nigga I don't need no swap
I don't eat no broccoli, no mo' 'cause doc I smoked a canteloupe
I'm smoking KK, you smoke BB, I shot Dae Dae with a BB
I'm spazzin' on they asses, flex so much, got muscle spasms
My haters proud of me, 'cause obviously I'm who they trying to be
Make it so damn hard to copy they still try to copy me
Mouth full of gold since 10 years old I hit a lick up top for these
Everybody watchin me, jockin' my flows
Catch 'em out there went and dropped diamond teeth
If they ain't permanent pull 'em out your teeth, hop out with Shotgun Pete
Hoppin' up out the Jeep, hoppin' out, hop, hoppin' out with the heat
Pimpin' bitches, I be trickin' freaks, tricked them for the treat
And I keep a mask on like it's Halloween, er'yday Halloween
C'est La Vie, nigga, what you say about me?
You ain't even in my league
Can't let you intervene, this orange codeine right here, that's yellow lean
Definitely, I can do the beat again and again right now if I please
Cheddar please, I'm 'bout my chedda' cheese, give my cheddar please!
'Specially, I got the melody, I got the recipe
I hop out every scene, I caught no felonies
Fuck a nigga mean?
My bitches yellow, but oranges be fittin' me better, she sweeter than tangerine
Glock 23, came with a drum every gun I got got a tambourine
Orange Balenciaga, I'm so unique, but my swagger mean
Orange Balenciaga, nigga, you can't tell if that disease

Baby, that's make believe
Maybe that's made with lean
She said, maybe that's Maybelline
Baby, that's made with lean
Jump through your window no trampoline
I be concrete in these skreets
Poke on one, I cut my sleeve

She say, maybe that's Maybelline
Orange soda, that my favorite drink

Glee, glee




 [Hook]
I'm grindin', I can't even get no rest
I'm vibin', I ain't even take my meds
Everybody like "what the fuck goin' on in your head"
I'm from Broward County, but not the same place as X
Yeah, I just fucked my ex bitch on that X
Say she miss me and she wanna get in my chest
Say she miss me when I used to have my dreads
And my niggas miss when I ain't had no bread

[Verse 1]
Say she love me, but I know that it's a test
I don't know how to answer that so I know I might get a F
I don't wanna do no quiz
I just wanna get a little smizzed
Why it gotta come down to this?
I just wanna shoot the shits
Say she pregnant, let me fuck so I can feed the kids
I know you don't like me well when I run up so I can split your wig
I'm gettin' tired of gettin' money 'cause all I do is get it
I went to sleep on stage, woke up and did another gig
Came home and did a bid, came home and did another bid
I don't watch no sports no more 'cause all that shit be rigged
I'm doin' too much, I got 30 in my clip
You shootin' too much, man, that nigga already dead
My little lady be like "Zaddy where you been"
I ain't yo daddy, but I prefer that name instead
I went to TV and put VVS on my set
So when you see me, you know he be gettin' checks

[Hook]
I'm grindin', I can't even get no rest
I'm vibin', I ain't even much take my meds
Everybody like "what the fuck goin' on in your head"

Yeah, I just fucked my ex bitch on that X
Say she miss me and she wanna get in my chest
Say she miss me when I used to have my dreads
And my niggas miss when I ain't had no bread

[Verse 2]
My nigga miss when I was still on the corner
Yeah, my niggas miss when I was in the yoda
Yeah, my niggas miss me when I was sellin' 'Yoda crack
"I watched him go up, now they call him Kodak Black!"
I fucked her in the ass and then I shitted on her
Ay, I skeeted on her face and then I hit it on her
Ay, I ain't take my prescriptions in a whole month
And I'm on my bullshit, I'm about to go nuts
I was doin' time and then detective showed up
Askin' about a murder, I told him "I don't know nothin'"
Y'all can call my lawyer, by the way, I got 4 of 'em
That money callin', by the way, I got 4 numbers

[Interlude]
Phone ringing
Hello?
Man, you trippin', man, you know I ain't go no more, umm, shit, it's whatever then, send me 4 of 'em!

[Hook]
I'm grindin', I can't even get no rest

But you know once you start having fun with it, you done with it
Pop stick 'em top

[Hook]
Told my mama 'bout, night I popped a top

Young nigga 17
Shoot you like J.J. Redick
He just young and dumb
He don't know where he headed
Polo to the socks
Popping up out the drop
Don't get in the water, nigga we'll crack your melon

[Verse 1]
Everybody around me felons
Run up on me, it's a dead end
Why am I doing all this sinning
I'm getting tired of repenting
I seen too much too early
I'm getin too much too early
I'm riding around with two 30's
Got 16 riding around 30's
Me and Lil Soto mad thugging
We started off as crash dummies
Now I be itching to wack something
Now I be itching to bag something
Ima get more time if, I murder the hype
I'm staying all nighter, I'm riding with the Bible
I'm laying on the pay right now, but I ain't talking to the Messiah
Mama he just text me though, and I ain't tryna let it go
So I'm just trynna let you know, before I go and wet him though
So you can pray over me,  so you can pray over me
Black Mustang sliding in a rental
Black Mustang riding on a nigga
Acting like you official
But I know you niggas be bitter
You a rat, you Master Splinter
Grew up like a caterpillar
Flew up went past you niggas
You ain't even on my chapter nigga
No time to grab your fauto
I'm spraying fully auto
Pulling up Murcielago
And I'm firing up this gelato
I'll going back to hitting licks
'Cause it boost up my adrenaline
My nigga just twinning with twenty
But he coming back and peeling it
Free all my Z's in the chain gang
We don't gang bang but we bang gang
Everybody with me on the same thing
Yea, you can call it synonym
I ain't got to write no text message
If you try me I'm sending them
I ain't got to write no threat message
If you try me, I'm sending them
Lil nigga he a fool
He done dropped out of school
He just want to ride with the tool
I remember I was you
I can't tell you what to do
'Cause you gonna do what you want to do
You wanna know how it feels, to give a fuck nigga the blues
You wanna be Sniper Gang too
You wanna be down with the crew
I know you just wanna be cool
I had to ride with you too
I told you go hit that dude
How you know you hit that fool
You said you heard about it in school
I had to slide with you too
Everybody with me on voodoo
Ima drop a nigga like doodoo
Mama I'm going cuckoo
I done lost all my noodles
I done lost all my marbles
I just want to go full throttle
I wanna marry Reginae Carter
Would you give me a daughter

[Outro]
I'm on that Effen vodka
What's your effing problem
We'll come see about you
And we ain't gonna tweet about you
Me and JD the mobsters

My whole team got yoppers
Infrared beam on your noggin

Nigga we Z's, we monsters
Nigga do you need a stylist

I was 15 with a AR




 [Intro]
On my lonely, scoping, poking
Crackers had to rope me

[Verse 1]
First i started off, with a 14
Then i worked my way up to a whole thing
I remember i was just 14
Soaked the game up, from sitting around the OG's
Ten toes down, i'm on my own feet
I ain't fucking with ya, if you owe me
I can't love a hoe, i love my OG
Cause love will get you killed, that's what she told me
I don't gang bang, but i'm a banger
But when i twist my fingers, i throw K's up
You ain't talkin' money, gotta hang up
Serving all my junkies, off my pager

[Verse 2]

Damn, i was in a jag, now i pull up in a Lamb
Abracadabra, that work go kazam
Fuck your baby-mama, kick her out, i call a pam
Finessing's all i know, i be quick to pull a scam
Jumpin' out your house, you can call me Rob Van Dam
All these molly's bagged up, look like M&M's
E-murder on the same shit, i'm on like synonyms
I need my bread first, i don't worry 'bout the ham
So why i hate to see them flockas taking over bam
Free my brother cool, i can't wait  till I can see him
I started off finessing and i went hard
I told my mama imma' be a damn star
In this rap shit everybody flawed
I want all my money, save the damn talk
Dont make me start back, the way i left off
I found me a connect ain't talking X-Box
Then i copped a 4 in a baby
Slim white girl- i call her shady
Stick and move, you know i'm on probation
My P.O. be with the woo, but she dont face me
Youngest out the projects, i'm the baby
Mama brought me here, my mama flew from Haiti
Damn i had to let the streets raise me
I ain't have no other choice, the streets made me
I be sippin lean it keep me lazy
Like a flower- that codeine had me daisy
24 grams call me Bailey
I just want to thank the lord, 'cause he saved me
I was caved in on my lonely
Like a sad dog i had to roam free
Stop that dick ridin', you dont now me
Young nigga i be balling like Ginobili




 [Chorus]
The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business
Lil' Kodak had to get it off the land, talkin' Disney
You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties

[Verse 1]
I'm paintin' pictures, everythin' I say you see it vivid
Lil' Kodak makin' movies, I have you feelin' like you in it
I don't make no bubblegum music, I spit that real shit
You don't live this life, when you hear my songs, you'll feel like you lived it
I don't got no lady 'cause these bitches never like to listen
Gettin' bread every day, I graduated from biscuits
I don't do karate, so why lil' shawty wanna kick it?
The Audi got four rings, it think a nigga in the Olympics
I be money-launderin'
I got zero tolerance
When I get home I gotta hit (baby)
You better be in your lingerie (baby)

[Chorus]
The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business
Lil' Kodak had to get it off the land, talkin' Disney
You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties

[Verse 2]
Ain't talkin' Disney but I had to get it off the land
When you see me, I'm booted up, ain't talkin' Timberland
No not Boyardee but free my niggas in the can
How can you even sleepin' knowin' that you ratted on your man?
Like a newborn baby, how I'm suckin' on her breast
I got two fingers up her dress and she already wet
I'm calculatin' every move, this shit like playin' chess
AR-15 with the scope just like I'm Ron Artest
All you bitches, you can't touch this like I'm MC Hammer
Where were you when I was cuttin' dope with Arm & Hammer?
When I was jumpin' in them houses like I'm fuckin' Santa
They send me to the slammer, you won't even send a letter

[Chorus]
The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business
Lil' Kodak had to get it off the land, talkin' Disney
You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties

I'm 'bout to grab the Wraith, I'm 'bout to grab the key
I'm 'bout to snatch your baby girl and skeet all on her face
I got a feelin' that today gon' be a fantastic day
I'm gettin' tired of the Rollie, I think I want Patek Philippe
It's either I win or you lose, 'cause I won't accept defeat
And everybody wanna have the sauce, well I got the recipe
I'm sippin' on Belaire 'cause it make me feel like I'm on ecstasy
I love my baby, when I come home, I be rubbin' on her feet
And she be always in my chair, she hate when I be in the streets
My rims taller than my son, I'm 'bout to drop another one
You think a nigga in a band the way I hit him with that drum, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake

[Verse 2]
My chain VVS
I'm booted up, I got more pills than a CVS
I'm the shit, baby girl, so I got stains in my drawers
All this money like a nigga hit the fuckin' Power Ball
Sippin' on champagne, my whip on Dana Dane's
No time for you lames, I'm flyer than a plane
I'm ridin' like a train, she love to give me brain
You shootin' with your eyes closed, you ain't Sniper Gang
She held me down when I was gone, I bought her Audemars Piguet
I love her like I love my brother, so I let her be my connect
I put her thick ass in the vet, ten bracelets on her neck
You know lil' Kodak love to flex, I got my momma out the 'jects

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake




 [Intro]
My name Kodak and you know that

Go tell your mama, go tell your buddy
Go tell your pal, go tell your neighbor
Look, I'm Section 8, Taliban

[Hook]
It's that Project Baby, run and tell a friend
Codeine with Xan that's my medicine
Life sentence in the trunk, like a elephant
I don't fuck around, bitch I'm celibate
True to my religion I'm a Reverend
My money long, I might need a measurement
I'm fly, I'm high
Off this cannabis
It's a bird, It's a plane, It's a pelican

[Verse 1]
Lil Kodak, call me Peter Pan
Yeah, I'm the finesse kid, you can be the man
I gotta master mind, I just came up with a plan
I had to strategize, now I'm getting ten bands
Get it in, got them chickens, like I'm in the den
I poured a four, now I'm leaning like a kick stand
Number one, money blowing like a ceiling fan
I got them drums, nigga, I will hit you whole band
I was stuck, then I took off, now I back again
Nigga, please don't make Lil Kodak, go Super Saiyan
I took a chance, I got tired of eating noodle cans
Young nigga on jiggas, I will never land
Damn I just finessed my own people them
About this business, I hope don't look creep to them
Sour patch, cause these hoes I'm not sweet to them
Stuffed in up my trues, I'm walking with a limp

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Jump up out my whip, I pull up like I'm Batman
I just got outta jail, so bring them racks in
It's Lil' Kodak, motion picture, look how I'm flashing
Paparazzi kid, lights, camera, action
I took my tool and now I moving like a fat man
Little nigga, I'm just eating like I'm Pac-Man
I hit the scenes, spread my wings, I be super fly
He don't want it, I ain't worried, I'll shoot the guy
Usually I be polo down to the T
I'm a artist now so I'm dressed in Louie V
Who is he? Wanna drop a track, have fee
Foreign whip, can't pronounce it, got like two or three
Section 8, all this foreign shit is new to me
She don't like me, she in love with my jewelry
Project Baby running crazy, but I'm Cuban linked
Show the streets, because they love it how I do them beats

[Hook]




 [Intro]
Aye, it's two thousand eighteen hundred
1800 block
Free Jackboy
Sniper Gang

[Chorus]
We do the same thing, but won't do it the same
I pray to God that I ain't losing my brain
Made a lot of music to forget all of my pain
I just wanted money, but it came with some fame
I get on the beat, and I just be wanting to sing
Even though I wanted to it's never gone change
All the love I got for you is never gone change
Shit ain't never, never, ever gone be the same
Shawty say she love me, so she tatted my name
So I ever leave her then I'm leavin' a stain

[Verse]
Leavin' 'em all, tryna hide the scars
I can't hide my carnality, my personality
I am who I are
I'm sitting in the dark
All I want to do is shine, they throwing shade on me
I turnt that money clean off of living dirty
Can't leave the streets alone
It left a stain on me
I get on this beat like it's my testimony
We do the same thing, but won't do it the same
And everything they do it's like they all changed
I got skeletons in my closet by my Balmain
That's my shooter coming around here
That's my dawg, man
I promise we gone all ball, man
Just bought a mansion, you just bought a damn chain
I'm about wacking, hope you about the same thing
I tried to forgive you but something wouldn't let me
I think about my woe, I just popped a xanny
I'm still fed up, but I'm countin' fetty
I tried to forgive you but something wouldn't let me
I be going too hard I might break something
I get retarded, boy, I shake something

[Chorus]
We do the same thing but won't do it the same
I pray to God I ain't losing my brain
Made a lot of music to forget all of my pain
I just wanted money but it came with some fame
I get on the beat, and I just be wanting to sing
Even though I wanted to it's never gone change
All the love I got for you is never gone change
Shit ain't never, never gone be the same
Shawty say she love me, so she tatted my name
So I ever leave her then I'm leavin' a stain




 [Verse 1]

Imma eat that pussy for breakfast, save room for dessert
I woke up and straight applied pressure out the gate
Nigga you can't walk a mile in my size 8's
I'm tryna understand why all these niggas hate?
Because I be in my own lane, I'm tryna motivate
I wish I could hold 20 in my 38
But round here we ride 30s fuck them 28s

[Hook]
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put em on a shirt
And when that 40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt skrt

[Verse 2]
They say them youngings take something real quick
Lil nigga I be thuggin, quick to scheme some shit
Baby jump on my dick, I'll run in your shit
I will jump in your shit
I will go in your shit
And now I'm understanding all them people phony
But I can't believe my people put them people on me
I'm geekin', I ain't going to sleep I'm on a monkey
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
My nigga kick your door in, love to kick a door in
I don't wanna go back to scopin', wanna go back to pokin'
I guess I gotta pay for all the shit I did
I guess I can't forget that I was hitting licks
I jumped straight to size 7, I skipped size 6
I'm tryna get up out the 'jects, I can't stay out this shit
Gotta stay out this shit
Gotta stay out the mix

[Hook]
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put em on a shirt
And when that 40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt skrt

 [Intro]
Aye Kodak .. Yea I'm fresh out man, this that summer jam man
Yall slide this shit 'til school start back

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm 'bout to slide on ya ass
I ain't lookin' at ya, got my eyes on the cash
Baby daddy with me, he on C class
Look, I kill the scene dead, flies on ya ass
I feel codeine in my tank .. but ima pump 89 for the gas
Summertime niggas on the grind with the slab
Overtime nigga finna ride 'til ya crash
Baby I ain't tryna make ya laugh, but call me butthead
Got my mind on ya ass
This ain't a disguise, this a mask
This ain't a Nissan, this a Jag
No surprise boy you know I'm gone spaz
All that money gettin boy you know they gone ask
I ain't finna play, put the .40 on ya ass
In a Audi thing, 240 on the dash
Ya girlfriend know we got bags
Got her in the hotel, shorty getting smashed
It's just me and my niggas having a blast, living fast, buying the things we never had
We just love stunting, we ain't never like to brag
All us thuggin', we ain't never had a dad
I did a lot of dirt in my past, later on the cell came, bit me in the ass
Lately I be hit the beat with the tab
Lately I been doing shows back to back
Free Chattboy, free Cool
Im going hard, I ain't going back to school
Bob the Builder youngin' on the corner with the tool
Swimming in the money, what you doing in the pool?
Took flight, then I landed on the news
Playing with them bands, I ain't playing by the rules
Please stop playing girl you know how we do
Menajahtwa, bada-bing, bada-boom

[Interlude]
Haa, this that summer jam .. go tell ya momma them
This shit right here make you..
This shit right here make you wanna go run up a check
This shit right here make you wanna go put some golds in ya mouth or something..
Or go cop a foreign or something
Or get you some money, man run up a check

[Outro]
Kodak Bop, this the money dance
Ran up a check, get that money man
Ran up a check, I be dufflin'
Ran up a check, do the Running Man
Ran up a check, pop them rubber bands
Ran up a check, run it up again
Ran up a check, ran up a check
Fuck my ex, I ran up a check




 [Intro]
*Police sirens*
Real nigga files (hell yeah)
Project files (yes sir)
(everything 1k dawg)
Yeah (institution, for real man)
(you gotta stand firm, dawg, you gotta stay solid)
Project baby two, comin' out soon (for real)
(look, Kodak, Kodak)
Aye man, nigga got this lil burden off my back, dawg (for real)
Time to celebrate (weight off a niggas shoulders)
(got my feet back on the ground a lil bit)

[Verse]
Look, I've been in this shit for a lil minute, I'm gettin' lonely now
Constant conversations with my lady, she gon' hold it down
My nigga, he just got out of the gram, he got locked up again
I be feelin' like it's my fault that he right back in
He just wanted a lil money, and I knew a way how
I told him to pack his bags, we goin' out of town
And shit, I knew the best option for us to stay down
But fuck all that, we young niggas, we need it right now, man
Shit get crazy, when you in these types of places
Shit don't even feel the same no more, everybody changin'
It's amazin', when you make it, made it out your situation
And surprise everybody, you should see these niggas faces
I done took a lot of losses
I done caught a lot of cases
Had to cut my nigga off, man I just couldn't shake it
Used to treat him like a brother, but that nigga so shady
I hate it, but this the life of a project baby
I'm here, and I'm plannin' on blowin' this year
Disappear, into spirit, wrist shine like chandelier
They tellin' lies like Pinocchio, they don't even know me though
But they wanna ride for me, they ain't even rode before
Rollin' like a roller-coast, backwood, I'm rollin' dope
Told my future bright, yesterday I read my horoscope
I remember, I was in a jam, they said "it's over for"
Young nigga, addicted to them bands, I'm bout to overdose
Institution, this that project music
Paper chase, on the interstate, stick and movin'
Throwin' rocks at the chain gang
Out here tryna slang Caine
Asked God to forgive a nigga, but I just do the same thing
Cause I'm still on the same shit
And I'm still with the same clique
My girl is still around with me
I'm still with the same bitch
I'm still on the same strip
I'm still on the same corner
Now a young nigga smokin' crip
Remember I used to slang zona
I get in the booth and spit that fire, I put that flame on you
Rollin' off a monkey girl, come let me put this thing on you
Your niggas ain't your niggas, catch a charge and they gon' sing on you
They gon' turn the state on you
Switch, and put the blame on you
Now you want this head, don't you?
Now you wan't em dead, don't you?
I will pop a chance on em
Could of went fed on em
Back on my feet, my muscle up, it's time to flex on em
If a nigga slippin' with that pack, I go finesse, homie
(finesse homie, finesse homie)
*Police sirens*




 [Intro]
Yeah, I'm fuckin' with this shit right here, this straight
Y'all already know what it is, this lil Kodak, man fuck you fuck you kodak the mf shit i ate angel pussy in this bitch

[Hook]
This that real shit, for whatever shit you goin' through
I check your resume, before I do a song wit you
You don't feel this? Then nigga, I don't what's wrong wit you
You ain't her daddy, so don't think that bitch belong to you
She's a ill bitch, fuckin' me and all my homies too
She be on me, so why you think that all she want is you?

[Verse 1]
I was in that Yoda, sellin' Yoda on the move
Deliverin', I'm takin' orders, I ain't sellin' food
Book bag full of paper, but I never go to school
I use to tote that ball, now I just keep totin' tools
Yee ain't got no street cred, you ain't even got no bread
You be pillow talkin', boy, she told me everything you said
I be anywhere, go everywhere, just pull up on yo set
Pull up Panamare, flyers everywhere, oh, they dead
And I'm fresh to death, flyers everywhere, I kill em' dead
I won't fight you bout no bitch, but I gon' fight for my respect
I just post a picture, now she wanna get all in my chest
And the waiter beep keep knockin', I can't stop bopin' my head
Damn, I hate when you be stoppin', girl just keep droppin' that neck
I'mma hit you with this pistol, if you do that shit again
I love this shit, for real, and it ain't all about the bread
But I see I'm worth it, so now I be all about a check
They buy my shit on iTunes, but it free ride on the web
Cuz I drop that shit, you want to, you just pop it in, and play it
I don't wear that Invicta no more, I rock Audemars Piguet
Not a killer, but don't push me, cuz I'm too close to the edge

[Hook]
This that real shit, for whatever shit you goin' through
I check your resume, before I do a song wit you
You don't feel this? Then nigga, I don't what's wrong wit you
You ain't her daddy, so don't think that bitch belong to you
She's a ill bitch, fuckin' me and all my homies too
She be on me, so why you think that all she want is you?
You don't feel this? Then nigga, I don't what's wrong wit you
You ain't her daddy, so don't think that bitch belong to you

[Verse 2]
Road runner, bill, I'm on the turn pipe, just flowin' through
Pourin' out the seal, I'm poured a whole pint, pourin' a deuce
Only real relate, but you won't relate, even if you fake
I was hungry, cuz my daddy never stepped up to the plate
I'm a snapper, I'm a trapper, I'm a chapter, I'm a rapper
Nuttin' personal, but if you want a verse, then I'mma tax you
I just asked around town about ya, they said you a actor
We can't do no song, fuck the money, that don't even matter

[Hook]
This that real shit, for whatever shit you goin' through
I check your resume, before I do a song wit you
You don't feel this? Then nigga, I don't what's wrong wit you
You ain't her daddy, so don't think that bitch belong to you
She's a ill bitch, fuckin' me and all my homies too
She be on me, so why you think that all she want is you?
You don't feel this? Then nigga, I don't what's wrong wit you
You ain't her daddy, so don't think that bitch belong to you




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Off the head, shit, you know what I'm saying
Glee, brr, off the dome, man, I'm in, ayy

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
22 hours locked down, ain't shit to do but think
I remember like it was yesterday, was drinkin' out the sink
I'm sittin' back plottin', I'm just sittin' back vibin'
A nigga can't complain, I had to use my time wisely
I'm sleepin' in a dorm, but they ain't send me off to college
I still got money buried from that lick I hit in Raleigh
I'm book-smart but the streets gave me all my knowledge
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the projects
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the slum
A mouth full of gold teeth, they think a nigga dumb
I got a head full of dreads, think a nigga illiterate
But I know when I go to talk, a nigga'll reconsider it
I know you niggas just tryna benefit
I ain't fuckin' with you a little bit
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I was sellin' weed in middle school, just meet me in the halls
Right now I'm goin' in, but I was just behind the wall
This jail got me thinkin', I feel like everybody flawed
I got too much to lose, but I'll still go at a nigga jaw
I'm down for the count, I'm never down for the cause
I made a million dollars off of shows and goin' hard

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I love money, I can't go back to the bottom 'cause I
Hate it at the bottom, try to stop thinking about it
But, I'm reminiscing, yeah
I'm reminiscing, yeah
Fuck your problems, it's too late to tell me sorry
I pulled up in a 'rari, it don't come with no apologies
I'm reminiscing, yeah
I'm reminiscing, yeah

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I remember everythin', I done been through everythin'
I remember who shitted on me, or who been in the paint
Like Ray J, got a bitch from the Bronx givin' me brain
Like Ray J, I done walked through the motherfuckin' rain
Right now I done got too far to give a motherfucker a feature
I'm the freshest man in high school, but I'm a motherfuckin' senior
Lil' shawty want to kick it, I told her I don't play FIFA
I jumped up out the Beamer, now I'm slidin' in the regal
That pussy so tight but I be tryna go deeper
If she can make goulash, she a motherfuckin' keeper
Reminiscin' about my niggas, reminiscin' about my homies
I'm thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I'm thinkin' 'bout my whoadies
I don't fuck with Fooly no more but I still fuck with Koly
Got a booger in my nose, A Boogie on the chorus
A young nigga, I jumped off the porch, run Forrest
I'll lose it about that money, I'll go dumb for it
I'm workin' like a Mexican, fuck around and get deported
I bought my mama a crib, thirty clip in my forty
She said that my baby, I told that bih let's go to Maury
Lame niggas get extorted, if it ain't foreign then it's borin'

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I love money, I can't go back to the bottom 'cause I
Hate it at the bottom, try to stop thinking about it
But, I'm reminiscing, yeah
I'm reminiscing, yeah
Fuck your problem, it's too late to tell me sorry
I pulled up in a 'Rari, it don't come with no apologies
I'm reminiscing, yeah
I'm reminiscing, yeah
Reminiscing, yeah
I'm reminiscing, yeah




 [Intro]
Boy I'm higher than a bih [?]
I need some weed, I need to calm down fire that shit up
Aye John

[Hook]
I need to vibe 'cause I'm [?] right now
So I'm firin' up the crypt right now
Cause I'm higher than a bih right now
I'll turn this whole shit upside down

[Verse 1]
Stop lyin' on ya dick
If you hit her, then you hit
Stop lyin' on a bih
Everybody know ya snitched
Stop ridin' on my dick, why you worried 'bout me?
Pop one, pop two, pop three
Fuck the law, I ain't worried 'bout a plea
Fuck the alphabet, boy I just copped a QP
See me when ya see me, it's Lil' K to the B
On my Kyocera, my lick just called me for them D's
I'm on E, pockets full, I'm on E
Ski with the Ree's, I could pull a couple G
Ten toes down, I can put you on yo' feet
Don't slow me down, roadrunnin' full speed
So high, I never felt like this
I'm so high, I'm 'bout to beat my bitch
I'm so high, it got my teeth grindin'
But fuck it, I'm just gon' keep slidin', 'cause the beat ridin'
I used to swim in the money, now I'm deep divin'
I swear I'm higher than a bih, it got me freestylin'
She say "Boy I never felt like this"
I told her "Shut up and eat my dick"
Aye pass the joint, you know sharin' is carin'
I'm so high, I'm just sittin' here starin'
(Kodak what you lookin' at? You zoned out)
'Bout that money, I'll shoot out to Maryland
All these books, you'd think I'm a librarian
I bumped into a powerhouse, [?]
You keep grindin', you can get a McLaren

[Interlude]




 [Chorus]
I just want the money
Cause I heard the money bring you power
Now a nigga on top
I remember I hit rock bottom
I don't wanna be yo friend
I already know you niggas sour
Hoe that ain't my DNA
I already know I ain't the father

[Verse 1]
Lil' kids look up to me like I'm they father (Like I'm they daddy)
Run up on me like "Kodak give me a dollar" (I give them five dollars)
Girl when I first met you, you was smaller (Girl you was so small)
Since I start hittin' it's like that booty gettin' larger
I just touchdown on yo' ass, feel like Tiki Barber
Now a nigga wearing Hugo boss remember when it starter (When it starter)
I just picked a pack up like Brett Favre (Like Brett Favre)
I just want to buy my mom a car (My mom a Bentley)
Stop right there girl we can't go no further (Baby stop it)
No not Listerine but shawty love to gargle (No not mouth wash)
Look cool nigga, but I'm hot like lava (Hot like lava)
Swimming in the money I need goggles (Swimming in the money)

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Cause I heard the money bring you power
Now a nigga on top
I remember I hit rock bottom
I don't wanna be yo friend
I already know you niggas sour
Hoe that ain't my DNA
I already know I ain't the father

[Verse: 2]
I already know about you lil homie
I just checked your resume boy you a phony
Oh my god i hope that ain't the police
Cuz i got a 30 clip on me
Don't be calling me about your hoes
I don't want your girl, I got my own
Girl stop calling my phone, I'm getting money
I'm so geeked up, I'm paper junkie
McDonalds bitch, I love it
You broke as a joke lil boy you fronting
Looking for me I be on the ugly
In the projects right on 1800

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Cause I heard the money bring you power
Now a nigga on top
I remember I hit rock bottom
I don't wanna be yo friend
I already know you niggas sour
Hoe that ain't my DNA
I already know I ain't the father

Drop your top off with that bean
Mix it one-handed, please (it's lit), mix it right, dirty tea
It's only gonna bring me peace (straight up)
Don't leave my cup, that's for me

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (what)
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
And you say that you gon’ ride with me




 [Pre-Hook]
You ain't the one for me

[Verse 1]
Aye, I'ma just switch my flow up
Baby I'm sick, no throw up
Baby I'm sick, no checkup
Nigga you need to run you a check up
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup
I'm eatin' on you niggas, can't catch up
Even when I'm fuckin', I'm masked up
Hit her face down with her ass up
Hit her with no rubber but I'm masked up (aye)
Everywhere I go, I'm masked up
Lil' Kodak Black, that's a, lil' dirty bastard
In a black Jaguar
Pull up in a white Jaguar
Remember pull up in a champagne Jaguar
Pull up in the same Jaguar
Rough ridin', that's my lifestyle, like fuck a Magnum
Cool my kin, when I was a lil' kid, Tracy used to sell magnums

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't the one for me
You ain't got shit I need
Want me to take my time with ya, maybe I'm not ya speed

[Verse 2]
I ain't never understand
You was lookin' like I ain't need ya
Girl you just like the streets, 'cause both of y'all bittersweet
Don't need no referee
Been thuggin' since little league
And they don't wanna hear me preach
They don't wanna hear me preach
You a walkin' duck out in these streets
I found myself right in these streets
I lost myself and found myself right in these streets
I was by myself, I was by myself right in these streets
By myself lil' nigga, I keep that shit discreet
I don't give a fuck because I'm bleedin' concrete (aye)
You niggas bleedin' Kool-Aid, you niggas sweet (aye)
You niggas bleed Kool-Aid

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't the one for me
You ain't got shit I need

Teacher tried to put me in timeout, I said, "fuck class"

[Verse]
You ain't my mama, ho, I ain't gettin' in nun no corner, I said "fuck class"
Told me say no drugs, nope, you know I upped that
You already know I'm jello, graduated finnessin' got me a lunch rack

Finesse you out your lunch sack
Forgot my bookbag at the crib, but I ain't forget about the dutch pack
Geeked up like a nerd, nigga, test me, you get fucked back
Got them books on me, and just this page I'm readin' right now a hundred racks
Doctor ion take my meds no more right now, it cost me double stacks
Jaguar orange [?], jansport in the locker
I just seen my old teacher, she still waitin' on her retirement check
Lil homie SAT back, then I had a MAC-10
Said I'm on my way, make sure your babies with there daddy
I ain't no babysitter, but I be kidnappin'
That Glock will shock a nigga, what's that Glock static
Angelica, she suck my testicles, bih so fantastic
I don't fuck with Susie, because I don't want no black ho
Reptar, I go dinosaur

Pull up like a diaper

The teacher said, "it's naptime", but I am tired of sleepin' on the floor
Dumpin' at them, bagged the nigga, but ion do no fuckin' chores
Let me find out you still at summer camp

Aye, lemme find out you still at daycare
Put that wooly on that little boy and he shitted on himself

Rollin', I be dufflin'
Youngin', he be thuggin, yeah

[Outro]
All grown up, I'm a rugrat
Still can't hit the club, and get drunk, but I'm like fuck that
Teacher tried to put me in timeout, so I said, "fuck class"
Fuck class, ion need class
Booted up when I see class




 [Intro]
Like-like-like-like
I'm-I'm-I'm through with this shit, like
This shit ain't even workin', bae
This shit ain't gon' work, I ain't gon' lie to you
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

Like I ain't even gon' lie, bae, I don't see no future in us
I ain't like these other dudes, I'ma give this shit to you with no autotune, yeah
Fuck a slurpee I'm so smooth

[Chorus]
Been runnin' out of love for you lately (out of L-O-V-E)
I don't wanna fuck wit' you no more (Baby I'm T-I-R-E-D)
I ain't got no hope in us baby (Ain't got no H-O-P-E)
It don't make no sense tryna hold on (Baby I'm tired, baby I'm tired, there ain't no we)
Been runnin' out of love for you lately (There ain't no hope, there ain't no us, there ain't no we)
I don't wanna fuck wit' you no more (There ain't no we)
I ain't got no hope in us baby (There ain't no we)
It don't make no sense tryna hold on

[Verse 1]
I've been runnin' out of reasons, right now I don't even care
I've been runnin' out of feelings, I been speedin' out of air
I don't know how the fuck I'm breathin' 'cause I'm runnin' out of breath
Got me runnin' out of love, I been runnin' out of air
I've been runnin' out of trust, you ain't worthy
Fell into some feelings now I'm dirty
Brush me off, dust it off
Shut your mouth, cut it out
I was kickin' in doors and runnin' out
That's the same way I'm runnin' out on you
Drinkin' my heart out, poured it out for you
I done even cut my homies out for you
I done even cut my buddies out for you
I done even cut my cousin out for you
Caught myself all gettin' soft
Caught myself like Randy Moss
I ain't got time I'm windin' out
Done did enough time, been in and out

[Chorus]
Been runnin' out of love for you lately (out of L-O-V-E)
I don't wanna fuck wit' you no more (Baby I'm T-I-R-E-D)
I ain't got no hope in us baby (Ain't got no H-O-P-E)
It don't make no sense tryna hold on (Baby I'm tired, baby I'm tired, there ain't no we)
Been runnin' out of love for you lately (There ain't no hope, there ain't no us, there ain't no we)
I don't wanna fuck wit' you no more (There ain't no we)
I ain't got no hope in us baby (There ain't no we)
It don't make no sense tryna hold on

[Verse 2]
Keep tryna check my cellular
Girl you got me thinkin' 'bout branchin' off
Nah, this ain't her, you way off
Baby this Jake from Statefarm
Got too much fishes in this water
Too much fish to worry 'bout ya
Too much fish to fry a piranha
Rather make a song than argue
You wanna fuss until tomorrow
Leave me alone I'm droppin' a album
Blowin' me up, I'm droppin' a verse
Put my phone on "Do Not Disturb"
I've been runnin' out of love
I've been runnin' out of words
Tired of askin' you "What's the matter?"
'Cause matters gettin' worse
I'm 'bout to kick you to the curb, skrrt skrrt
Lately I ain't been in your skirt, skirt, skirt
You would rather exchange words for a skirt
I'd rather pull up in a verse, skrrt skrrt
In traffic bent, I'm swerving
You flaggin', baby, you perkin'
I got a bag, but you can't get Birkin
We ain't lastin', this ain't workin'

[Chorus]
Been runnin' out of love for you lately (out of L-O-V-E)
I don't wanna fuck wit' you no more (Baby I'm T-I-R-E-D)
I ain't got no hope in us baby (Ain't got no H-O-P-E)
It don't make no sense tryna hold on (Baby I'm tired, baby I'm tired, there ain't no we)
Been runnin' out of love for you lately (There ain't no hope, there ain't no us, there ain't no we)
I don't wanna fuck wit' you no more (There ain't no we)
I ain't got no hope in us baby (There ain't no we)
It don't make no sense tryna hold on

You know I love to make your day (you know I love to make your day)

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna show you I appreciate you (I appreciate you)
Tonight I wanna prove to you (I wanna prove to you)
I flew to you without my cape (I flew to you without my cape)
Went out my way to save you (went out my way to save you)
My homies tellin' me don't save that girl (tellin' me don't save that girl)
But girl, I'm gonna save you (but girl, I'm gonna save you)
I'll buy you what you say, ooh (I'll buy you what you say, ooh)
I love you like I made you (I love you like I made you)

[Verse 1]
I'm scared to show you how I feel
I ain't got no heart, but you the one that make me feel
How you would you take it, if I show you how I feel?
It's somethin' bout you, I ain't even know that I could feel
Say you ain't the one, but I'm rockin' with you still
Ain't about the sex, girl, we could Netflix, we could chill
I'm here to stay, I love you like you my kid
And by the way, I want you to have my kid
My homie told me no, baby girl, I'm gonna save her
I think they might be right, I'm just gon' regret it later
Money over bitches, but girl, I love you like the paper
'Cause when you with me, I don't even want to get no paper

[Chorus]
Hold me down so I can bless you (hold me down so I can bless you)
I'm comin' for the rescue (I'm comin' for the rescue)
Girl, I'll be there to save the day (girl, I'll be there to save the day)
You know I love to make your day (you know I love to make your day)
I'm comin' straight to you (I'm comin' straight to you)
I'm on my way to you (I'm on my way to you)
I'm runnin' out things to say (I'm runnin' out things to say)
But I got some things I wanna do to you (some things I wanna do to you, baby)

[Verse 2]
I stopped hangin' with my homies, ain't listen to 'em
They tried to tell me you wasn't for me, ain't listen to 'em
That you my motherfuckin' one, you got me whipped
And I done chased you like the money
I like the way you walk, like the way you flip your hair
Too easy to give up, I wanna show you that I care
I'ma treat you like my shooter, me and you, girl, we're a pair
I'ma treat you like my food, baby, I don't wanna share, you
Make me forget that I'm a jit 'cause when I'm witcha
I don't even think about the streets
And when I'm witcha, I don't even wanna hear no beats
And if you leavin', I don't even know how I'ma breath

[Chorus]
Hold me down so I can bless you (hold me down so I can bless you)
I'm comin' for the rescue (I'm comin' for the rescue)
Girl, I'll be there to save the day (girl, I'll be there to save the day)
You know I love to make your day (you know I love to make your day)
I'm comin' straight to you (I'm comin' straight to you)
I'm on my way to you (I'm on my way to you)
I'm runnin' out things to say (I'm runnin' out things to say)
But I got some things I wanna do to you (some things I wanna do to you)

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna show you I appreciate you (I appreciate you)
Tonight I wanna prove to you (I wanna prove to you)
I flew to you without my cape (I flew to you without my cape)
Went out my way to save you (went out my way to save you)
My homies tellin' me don't save that girl (tellin' me don't save that girl)
But girl, I'm gonna save you (but girl, I'm gonna save you)
I'll buy you what you say, ooh (I'll buy you what you say, ooh)

 [Hook]
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shape back

[Verse 1]
Pokin windows that's la jackboy n la j black
I'm bout to wet the Cutlass, fuck a Maybach
Free J Green, they tryna give him 8 flat
I went duffin up da road I caught the plane back
If rap don't work, then I'm back up on that same crap
You can leave, baby, you gon' find your way back
He can't even spell, but he can sell dope
Once you come up from that corner, boy you gettin' low
They been lookin' for the boy, think they tryna scope
They gon' pop it, you can lock it, you still gettin' poked
I remember you was ballin', now you dead broke
The last time I seen that nigga, he was smokin' potes
I got nigga locked up, and they losin' hope
I don't do it for the hood, I do it for my folks
The neighbors on us, so we hit the bad up
But now I'm on the radio, no more camera

[Hook]
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shape back

[Verse 2]
I've been stayin' focused since I came back
But I will still push your top, way back
I got some money, a lil power, and some fame too
I just want the money, but they gave me fame too
You ain't really in the hood, I just came through
In the Audi A4 and the paint blue
They gon' love you now but later they gon' hate you
My lil bitch from Gainesville, I call her gator boo
I ain't made the rules, but I break the rules
I was fucked up by that movie, now I'm paid in full
Go hard like go, go, do your thing boo
Get that money, just don't let that shit done change you
Left the high early, I ain't go to school
Young nigga bendin' corners in the old school
I just bought a new strap, no that's not my crew
I keep playin' with it, y'all might see me on the news

[Hook]
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shape back

Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Would've shot the nigga, that what Cuda did
Could've went platinum, that what Luda did
Should've could've did, could've would've did

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I should've did em in
Blood on my brother, I wouldn't have a friend
Ridin' in a spear diamonds, chandelier
I can't let you niggas near, bruh I wouldn't dare
If love lived here I still couldn't care
Imma get that Audi truck, pull up anywhere
Couldn't see ya, had my Ray Bans on
I would never see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
YSL cheetahs, these are not Adidas
Oh you wanna drop a track? Charge 'em for a feature
Ridin' with my (?) , wouldn't fuck with Keisha
Yellow submarine, I feel like the Beatles

[Hook]
Could've got the Beamer, I ain't really want it
Would've hit your girl, I wasn't really horny

Could've went platinum, that what Luda did
Should've could've did, could've would've did

[Verse 2]
Man, I should've got the Lex
Dropped the top on 'em, I ain't wanna flex
Would've hit your girl, I ain't want the sex

Would've picked your call up but I was gettin' to it
Ridin' like the rodeo
Never lie, money longer than Pinocchio
I said, nobody knows
You an undercover booger and nobody knows, faggot
My bankroll like me, never folds
I got my new bitch ridin' and she never rode

[Hook]
Could've got the Beamer, I ain't really want it

 [Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm tired of this

Why the hell you wanna stay with him?
Obviously you ain't shakin' him

You don't know what you could be
You ain't don't even know my pitch

I'm tryna make you my bih
I don't wanna be your mini-er
Don't wanna be your inferior
If you give me a chance
Baby, I'ma be your man

[Verse 1]
Baby, I ain't even playin'

Ain't gonna nowhere, I'm stayin'
Fuck them lil' hoes, they hatin'
Ain't gonna nowhere, I'm stayin'
Tired of this other nigga

But you don't wanna tell me his name

[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm tired of this

I'm infatuated with everything you do
But I'm tired of trying to impress you boo
So tell me what it is
And baby, I'ma let you live
Baby, I'ma let you be
Do you want him or you want me?
Swear I don't wanna be your secondary
Lil' Kodak crop him out the picture
Baby. you just don't know

I just wanna be your only though
That's only if you want me to

[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm tired of this

I don't wanna be your mini-er
Don't wanna be your inferior
If you give me a chance
Baby, I'ma be your man




 [Verse 1]
I ask the lord to send me a sign, I thought that I was blind cause I ain't never seen the sign. but the sign showed after time when I finally Realized it was too late to rewind
Guess I was just waiting on that sign, So I got up and went out on my grind. Cause I use to cry cause ain't no food in the house
Seeing all the older niggas man they use to shine, use to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine
Hypnotized, I was just nine. Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
Rapping killed  time the years flowed by til I got old enough to run up on ya with that nine
The light man we became friends, I see em so much he cutting off the light again?!
I know his name co-workers and his kid, he ain't coming in the work truck he coming in his van
The more my stomach growled, the more I wanna lay a nigga down....take yo shit and make em cry
Mama got robbed in July I watched her cry,  so I don't care bout yours cause they ain't care bout mine
But look at me now, they told me settle down, PBL charges got me waiting on trial
Oh so ya know now? They sign read "you never know til' you find out"
The things I found out... but they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if ya broke! cause if ya broke they treat you like a bad joke, they don't even wanna laugh with you
When you shittin on em you can make em do anything, they'll even wipe ya ass for ya
In this worldddd... full of fame and pretty girls, It can make ya mind swirl
But you just gotta thank, the devil he gone play get in yo brain, have ya runnin in them banks
But now I just want the world to scream my name, don't even club im the reason why they came
Taking people shit im the reason for they pain
Baker Act, I'm all the way insane
Poking houses going crazy bout them chains
Them Cuban links and them rings
Its deep the sign I couldn't see, look at me now im getting weak look at me now I can't sleep
Look at ya boy I can't eat...Ion thank ain't never thank all for some money I just might blow it all in a week
But its Kodak you niggas know dat ! im bout whatever and ill hit a nigga like a road-rat
But fuck dat ! right na im chilling, slow money cause fast money will get me sentenced
I was in it they say im a menace, say im sleeping and when I wake up ill be in prison
Im chilling, this how im feeling...give me a deal give me mill. so im finished
Forget it im still with it... to mask up and hit yo granny for a penny
They say im stupid, they say im foolish
Kamikaze, Baker Act, but I know what I'm doing
Fuck school everybody on the campus, I did it so im ready for all of the consequences
Hard to trust a nigga do I know? They hate lil koly'on so paranoid might have to blow you!
Fuck a friend family too ION KNOW YOU !
Bastard child hey daddy ION KNOW YOU !

[Outro]
Mmmmmm...mmmmmm
Gone change gone cha-ange, gone rain gone rainnn, feel pain feel painnn, just gotta maintain main-tain
Gone change gone cha-ange, gone rain gone rainnn, feel pain feel painnn, just gotta maintain main-tain

God dang, you just like my chain, you just like to swing
It's 1k, I got 22k and all my niggas bling
Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked
You would think I'm 'bout to smack your bitch, I made her hit her knees
Met this plug, I was talking 'bout he put that thing on me
I finessed him, ain't got time to let you run no game on me
Like i'm working out, life done dropped a lot of weight on me
I've been busy, I've been working hard so don't you hate on me
You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
Don't you switch, don't you change on me, no switching lanes on me

 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye, Sniper Gang
Rah, rah! Slay a nigga!
You know I'm slangin' cash
Sniper Gang
Rah, rah! Kill nigga!

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
My nigga slayed a nigga, I just came from hanging with him
I don’t know what really happened, I think he home invade the nigga
You never catch me out here clubbing unless they paid a nigga
Why the fuck I chase a bitch when I don’t even chase the liquor
Hell yeah they call me Kodak but I ain’t come to take no picture
So icy, make it blizzard, and I’m leaning sippin sizzurp
Lil Wiz, still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
Damn, I was textin’ drivin’, I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Wally say boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I’ma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, ‘cause mama soon as I hit her I’ma quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver ‘cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I’m smoking purp, thinkin’ ‘bout cheesy purp
Rest in peace, Wayne Head and Purp, them boys down to earth
She know I’m a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt
She know I be getting to the paper, I be putting in work
Up the road, playing with the papers, yeah I got that work

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I’m on that greedy shit, that fiendin’ shit, I need a piece
I’m on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I’m playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can’t spare bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep
I’m on that schemin’ shit, you better give me everything
I’m on that Demon shit, the devil know I keep that heat
You remind me of your bitch, I got you on your knees
Jeep Cherokee, I’m skiing with my dope boy wrist

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Take his bag then smash, what uncle telling me
Dirty pistol, dirty mask, another felony
Rocks in my mouth, I spit ‘em out when I was sellin’ weed
Choppers was tryna take me out at only seventeen
9 Glock, body rock, this bitch hold 17
Mouth wet, pussy hot, she just was 17 (too young for me)
Cocaine under my nails, working this triple beam
No fingerprints on my shells, too sticky from the lean
I’m on that greedy shit, it’s mine, I ain’t gon’ feed a bitch
Leave you leaking quick, one shot, one kill, Desert Eagle shit
I really got it out the mud, this ain’t no freebie shit
Guess how I got all my muscle, from deleting shit
Hard on the pussy, no old lady, I just borrow the pussy
These niggas thugging for the gram, gon’ record the pussy
Boy you remind me of your bitch, you a bitch
Your address supposed to be a nigga’s ditch
Old pussy ass nigga

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I’m on that greedy shit, that fiendin’ shit, I need a piece
I’m on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I’m playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can’t smell bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep
I’m on that schemin’ shit, you better give me everything
I’m on that Demon shit, the devil know I keep that heat
You remind me of your bitch, I got you on your knees
Jeep Cherokee, I’m skiing with my dope boy wrist




 [Intro]
I hit rock bottom
Thought I was never gon' come up bih
For real though, thank you Lord

[Verse]
Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined this
It's Lil' Kodak Black, but bitch don't capture this
I ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
'Cause I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, tote my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
Last time I let you slide, I'ma whoop yo' ass for this
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Aye, where them yellow bones?
I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put yo' hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said "I love you", I was just on that yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that and shit
Fuck it, I don't owe a nigga shit
I been out here thuggin' since a jit
Remember we was strugglin' in the bricks
Nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwin' rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothin' change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road runnin', switchin' lanes
State to state, I'm breakin' the bank
Went to BOA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here takin' chances everyday
Niggas out here wildin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smokin' dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place
First I start my day off with a wake and bake
I ain't workin' out but I be shakin' weight
Now my lawyer hollerin' "Pay me"
'Cause I got court December 7th
Just in case them crackers slay me
Girl I'ma come and get you pregnant
Just tell my baby boy his dad a legend
Just don't let him be like me, 'cause I don't learn my lesson
I was already a felon once they let me out my mama belly
Got a telly in my cell, I'm smokin' reggie with my celly
Yeah I'm young and reckless
I just stole a Lexus just to flex it
Hit the scene, still in full on Ree's and I ain't even sell it
I'm a street nigga after paper
I be snappin', I be scammin'
They used to call me Lil' Duffle cause I'm a young hustler
Nigga I bring that check in
Uh uh
I'm a lil' motherfucker, I'm fuckin' on ya mammy
Slidin' in a Infiniti
Down here, we call that bih a FinFin
Yeah, man they leaked my goddamn song and I wasn't even finished
Young nigga, I'm dufflin', yeah, I'm gettin' to them Benji's
Mind yo motherfuckin' business
Windows tinted, I think this my car
I think this shit rented
Windows tinted, I think this a new one
I think this a rental
Everything orange, I'm smokin' cantaloupe

[Outro]
Thank ya Lord
I swear I ain't never expected this before
I ain't shit, so why you sendin' me all these blessings?
Roadrunnin', tunnel vision, I been speedin' with no limit for it
But I ain't never thought that it could get this far
First they wanted me to win, I had all the support
But once I won, they don't love me no more
'Cause they wanted me to win, but they ain't want for me to get this far
They say "No, no I ain't mean for you to get that far"
Drop a nigga girlfriend off to school in a Jaguar
Drop a nigga bitch to work in a Jaguar




 [Conversation]
(Chick): Girl came to the door yesterday asking for you
(Kodak): Yes, but it was Saturday out there, I was at church
(Chick): Nigga, don't go to church
(Kodak): How you gon' tell me I don't go to church
(Chick): Nigga, don't go to church, nigga
(Kodak): How you gon' tell me I don't go to church, go ask Jesus, ask Jesus
(Chick): Imma get your mind right for that dick
(Kodak): I need my mind right
(Chick): What?
(Kodak): I need to get my mind, I need my mind right

[Verse]
Watch when they find out me and you been gettin’ serious
Everybody ain't gonna like it when they hear
Girl, I don’t care ‘bout no fame, I make you famous
I don't care if that's the only reason you came for
These hoes always make me feel good, that money can’t
I can't find no love so I went to the bank
Auh, I should live for love, so I went to the bank
We met at B.O.A and then we met again at chase
Every thug need a shoulder they can lean on
I like what's on your shoulders, good head you be thinkin' on
Speakin' of head, I hate sex but I love my peter blown
You're a lil freaky hoe but you complete me, though
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my bling on
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my rings on
See I'm a dog, I be just trynna get me a bone
He roam the streets alone you need to leave em alone
Stray dog, I don't need a home I don't be at home, I'm fleeing home
Raw dawg when I fuck her with no rubber but my ski is on
She heard I'm snot side nigga over there
She heard I'm snot sneaky nigga over there
They tellin' me she a thot, that hoe over there
But I don't even care if she have gonorrhea
They say she a sick bitch, I heard she got syphilis
But I'm going head first, jumpin' straight in it
I'm just kiddin' but I love that little babe
But I don't care if she a slut, she still my bae
And I don't need you telling me about how she do
She fuck everybody, and I fuck everybody too
Everybody say she out here trickin', I don't give a damn 'bout how she get it
Everybody say she got all the niggas So what? I got all the bitches
We got chemistry, fuck your history, I don't care if she was out here strippin'
I'm tellin' you baby, they ain't gon' like you jumpin' out that Bentley
Hittin' the scene in the Bimmer, I'm T-Double-D, you Trina
Everybody tellin' me she ain't shit, but nigga, I ain't shit either
And I don't give a damn 'bout none of that shit my nigga say
He tryna convince me he seen you on backpage
Everybody got an opinion, I don't give a damn anyway
I took her on a private plane, I took her on a dinner date
Everybody fuckin', everybody sinnin'
So what's wrong with turnin' that hoe into a princess
Yap, I can turn that hoe into a model
Scoop her in the Bentayga, no more Monte Carlo
If she ain't in a coupe with me, I want nobody in it
Bendin' corners wit' ya and my windows ain't even tinted
Babe, don't call me ese but I love it when we kick it
Fuck that he say, she say, it ain't nobody business
They ain't gon' like it, they ain't gon' like it
They ain't gon' like us, they gon' wanna fight ya
And I don't like people but I think I like her
I done let that hoe inside my heart now, wanna wife her
If I wife her I'm going Steve Austin with the ring
There's a stone cold diamond on her finger and it bling
I'm 'bout to cut off all my friends, I'm 'bout to cut off all my kin
Man, that pussy be pullin' me in, I thought it was a one night stand
I thought it was a one night stand like the lamp on my dresser
So she a lil dirty heifer, but this girl special
Thought it was a fling, thought she was a fling
I've been havin' dream lately, she might be my main
'Could you be my main? Could you be my baby?
Lifes gave me lemon, wonder could you be my main squeeze
Damn I fell in love with a nat
But every sinner got a future, and every saint got a past
So I ain’t even finna hold her accountable to that
'Cause baby see you ride, yo, that lil' bitch, she got my back
Baby she be ridin', that lil' bitch, she got my back
And when we ride, yo, my 'lil bitch she hold the strap
My nigga startin' cryin' when we went out in scraps
My babe more real than you, she one thou, keep that shit a stack
I don't throw no money, took my bitch to the club and threw some racks
Man with the plan, master mind my crafts, no more shootin' craps
I ain't no dog but call me Ken with the Ben, fucking on a brat
My lil bitch a brat, I hate how she act
But I love how she act, that my lil diva
If you keep it up I'm put you on a TV-show
I was just trynna rap, you turned me to a singer
Found my focus back, turned me to believer




 ( 1800, I'm a damn gunner, a fucking road runner, got a stick with a whole 100, nigga you don't wanna run up run up, u get done up
400, 4way but I'm 3way )

[Chorus]
I just wanna get that money (get that money)
I just wanna get that money, flip that money (flip that money)
I just wanna stack them hundreds (stack them hundreds)
I just wanna spaz out, cash out (cash out)

I just wanna stack them hundreds (stack them hundreds)
I just wanna spaz out, cash out (cash out)

[Verse 1]
I'm a young nigga, I just wanna live, I just wanna chill
Smoking loud in a foreign whip
Independent, I don't want a deal, I just want a mil
Plus I'm hungry, I just want a meal, I ain't eat yet
I been up all night, I ain't sleep yet, and I need rest
But my dreams I ain't reach yet
Project Baby playing with the sack, ain't playing recess
Boy I need the check
I just wanna ball til I fall, but I ain't trying to fall
Boy I want that money out the ass, out my fucking drawers
Where the money? Boy I want it all, better have it all for me
If I throw these 1's, shawty better take it off for me
Money talk, she be capping, that bitch love talk to me
Charles Barkley, and they say the Migos stole my beat, but that shit don't bother me
Cause I just wanna be and I just gotta be, and its K to the B
I been on my P's and Q's before I knew my A's and B's
I was failing at my school, but in these streets got A's and B's
I was late for all my classes, but in these streets faithfully
4th quarter that was me, last year I made the beat
So, you can't change the beat, I already made the beat

[Bridge]
I just wanna rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna sack up on em, rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna stack up on em (stack up on em)
Then hit the corner and bring the Jag out (Jag out)

[Verse 2]
Ray told me bring him back some gold, I pulled a bag out
Nigga you mothafuckin hero nigga, I'm a bad guy
Nigga me and you, cops and robbers, you a damn cop
You a damn lie, boy I seen you smoking damn flock
Make them bands drop, 22 karats in my damn mouth
I was 16, nigga we ain't have no damn house
Had to stand down, Lil Kodak Black, I'ma standout
And I'm out in public, disrespecting, smoking damn loud
Oh, oh, oh Kodak you is out yo damn mind
Think I been here before, I'm before my damn time
I will come and end you, I'm a fucking Vampire
Hammondville to [?], Pompano my Franchise

[Chorus]
I just wanna get that money (get that money)
I just wanna get that money, flip that money (flip that money)
I just wanna stack them hundreds (stack them hundreds)
I just wanna spaz out, cash out (cash out)
I just wanna rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna sack up on em, rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna stack up on em (stack up on em)
Then hit the corner and bring the Jag out (Jag out)




 [Intro]
Institution
Ha ha, man
Uh

[Verse 1]
In this life that I live, look, I'mma stand firm
Mamma told me bout my homeboys, but I guess I had to learn
See, people go to switchin' seats, the table never turn
Mamma told me not to touch the stove, but look, I got burned
They spreadin' lies, like a germ
Set my head head hot, like a perm
Was a jailbird, but they set me free, so the early-bird got the worm
I've been up, but I've been down
I was stuck, but I've been 'round
Pokin' windows, way outta town
I was lost, but now I'm found
These streets showed me how to be a man, cuz my dad wouldn't show me how
But it's too late to show me now
Cuz I'm in too deep with this lifestyle
Lord forgive me for that abortion, I wasn't ready to have no child
I was hittin' my girl with a bare dick, I ain't even have no lifestyle
Been out here, since a lil child
They safari, runnin' wild
Got felonies all in my file
Got me back n' forth, in the juvenile
Had to take my eyes off the prize, real quick
But, now my eyes on the prowl
I was hittin' licks, cuz I was on my dick, stayin' at my aunties house
Tryna stack them them racks in a pile
When I rap, they be like "wow"
I can't even have no friends no more, so tired of them rattin' me out
Keep my head high, to the clouds
I stay hot, on that loud
These permanent, in my mouth
Look, I'mma stay ten toes down
Gotta keep my head on a swivel
I hear these niggas will kill you
Niggas sprung out on them flockas, they ain't really got shit to live for
Young niggas, high riska's
Everyday, on the go
Already got a lil money, still out here tryna get more
This shit like shootin' dice, they just tryna hit a lick
Dope boys, they up all night, they just grindin' for a brick
I'm tryna stay out the mix
These niggas ain't real
These niggas go down, they'll snitch
Trust me, I know the deal
Lil project baby, in the field, runnin' with the still
Road runnin', for that money, wearin' Chest DeVille
I remember pourin' molly, in the Zephyr Hills
On the interstate, ridin' by them 18 wheels
(free bands)

Can't be out here flaggin can't punk fake
You just gotta keep that shit 1k




 [Intro]
Totin', aye
That project baby two, hell yeah
But right now, this that institution
Yeah, for real man
For all that time I was down, man
They said I caught 11 years, man
Fuck that shit, look it, man
I do this shit bad, on the real, nigga
I never seen the work, dawg

[Verse]
Look, this for all that time when I was lost, they left me stranded
See, I don't even do this for myself, this for my family
I made a lot of mistakes, made it off circumstances
That could've ruined my life, I'm bout to sign with Atlantic
Look, God be lookin' out for me, he gave me several chances
I sent him a lot of prayers, he sent me a lot of places
My momma said "Imma make it" told me that it's destined
I put in a lot of work, and now my dreams manifestin'
Project baby, I cultivated, do somethin' amazin'
I pulled up, all that bullshit, I just couldn't take it
I thought it was over for a minute, a bad situation
I was so far away from home, but I just emancipated
I'm just so captivated, that I could be here again
So fascinatin', to see my people again
Swear I tried to leave the streets, but they was pullin' me in
My nigga rolled a statement on me, I thought he was my friend
I can't even pretend
I love to jump on these beats
Tell my fans what I'm feelin' deeply inside of me
This what's inside of me, y'all a big part of me
I'm sorry for leavin' y'all, this my apology
I just hope y'all believe it, got trues and paid dues
But it ain't easy as queasy, it's like I'm here for a reason
I just hit rock bottom, I thought everything was sweet
But many niggas so sour, man
My cousin had me sellin' powder, I was bumpin' em off
We used to bag em up, and keep it all at my momma house
All my niggas out there livin', just keep livin' it up
All my life, in the projects, I was livin' it rough
When I was down and out, ain't nobody really gave a fuck
They ain't really down with you, they only down when you up
I used to be that cafe fit, the full holster in the cut
A young nigga, sixteen, with Remy in my cup
I had to take a Gatorade, braid, ran to these streets
I had to cut my niggas, showin' they were playin' for keeps
That's all a nigga has to tell ya, they were leechin' on me
I ain’t even charging them, getting fame for free
When I was in a sticky one, they ain't show no support
Before I learned how to swim, I jumped straight off the porch
We know a nigga from the south, hittin' licks up in north
I used to play ball, but now I'm in a whole other court
I'm married to the game, we ain't never tryna divorce
Fell in love with the game, I gave a bitch intercourse
Oh, you thought this shit was over with? Nigga you crazy
Kodak Black, I bounce back, like a foreigner baby
Boy this ain't no fugaze, run it back, yeah it's true
Ain't none of this no fugaze, what I be spittin' to you
Cuz I just get in the booth
And I be spittin' the truth
How I be spittin' to you, you think I'm missin' a tooth
How I be whippin' the coupe, you think I'm missin' no roof
Catch me playin' with the chick, like cock a doodle doo
I was out there on the jigga, call your boy jiggaboo
I ain't talkin' cereal, but I be gettin' the loop

[Outro]
Ha ha
Hell yeah, man
Kodak, keep movin'
You can do it
This that Institution
Free my nigga Kol

Aw man I forgot where my head went

Pull up, throw my keys to you nigga valet park
You can't even crank my shit up that's push to start
She say "Kodak you get on my damn nerves"
And I say " Bitch you got on my dick first!"
My pinky ring bout bigger than my head is
And all yall lookin down at my feet when I said this
My top flew off my zoos same color as my whip
These diamonds on my wrist same color as my bitch
She yellow bone she like L O L
You hear that smell it's so loud like turn it down
She like L O L you hear that smell its so loud you get it now?

[Bridge]
You get it
It's so loud, you hear that smell?
Like the weed loud
You hear it, it's loud

I can do this shit because you niggas jokes
I can crack jokes on you niggas while I'm in the booth
Because I'm laughing at you niggas
You niggas characters, man
It's Kodak Black, Project Baby

[Verse 2]
Never know how I'm coming
They just know I'm coming
They just know when I pull up
They just know I'm stunting
Kodak, and you know that
Ain't fuck with me before rap
I been had swag before rap
I run the game and you know that
Never know until I appear
VVS Diamonds so clear
I can end you niggas career
True Religion jeans on my rear
She say, "Kodak you get on my damn nerves"
I'm so fly, I be shitting on Mockingbirds
Bang, I'm reloaded
My wrists frozen
The kid golde
The streets chose him
I'm back at it
It's Lil Black at it
Hopped in the booth with these cameras on me
Like a jack rabbit
I count up, no mathematics
I'm so fly, no aerobatic
I'm so high and you know I'm that guy
Money longer than Pinocchio's nose
Nigga I won't lie

[Bridge]
My money longer than Pinocchio's nose
I won't lie
Every time Pinocchio lies his nose grows
But I won't lie
I swear to God I crack myself up dog
Imma do this shit every time
Imma keep you niggas there all the time
I be tryna let them breathe a little bit
Not finna suffocate

[Verse 3]
I got it
And I been knew I got it
I run the game you niggas lame
Wanna battle me? I doubt it
Look Kodak, Koly
I rock foreign
You niggas boring
C4 bomb [?] I blow it
I'm flowing
Fuck these hoes, I don't need them for the moment
Just fucked the booth that bitch be wet
She be super soaking
She say, "Kodak you just think you everything."
Make it rain in the club, see the storm looking out your window pane
B-ball
I'm classic, no Reebok
Your girl sat on this dick and she caught seat lock
I meant that
Why should I joke?
Take notes to these lyrics I wrote
Somebody call a mechanic, man these niggas broke
Woah, a nigga swag stupid like Moe
Get dumb on the beat like Larry, Curley [?]
Freeze, my neck so cold
I got it
And I been knew I had it
I'm getting bread now these niggas wanna jam
Lil Kodak wanna make a sandwich

[Outro]
I'm getting bread so they wanna jam me
They wanna make a sandwich
A PB&J sandwich, I swear to God
It's Kodak Black
Project Baby, ghetto child
The golden one
They say I'm the chosen one
You niggas might as well give up man
If you sleeping on me, wake up




 [Hook]
Jumped in my coupe and I can't even steer
(I hit the gas)
Got Ferragamo hanging off my rear
(Hanging off my ass)
You know my dope so loud you can't even hear
(You can't even hear)
Extended clip hanging round off my hip
(You get hit)
It's lil Kodak and you know that I am here
(You know that I'm that kid)
I'm on these pills and I cannot sit still
(Man I can't sit)
I'm splurgin' switchin' gears
(You know I'm burning now)
Can't love no hoe, no I'm not Jack and Jill
(No I can't love a thot)

[Verse 1]
I'm flipping pages, stacking paper like the chef
Fuck you niggas, I been thugging by myself
.40 cal hanging off my Fendi belt
And when I grow up I just wanna be a chef
I got my money right now all these bitches left
My money dirty, hit the club and make a mess
And how I'm running with the tech they call a ref
Man I threw my dog a bone, I told him fetch
My dope is loud
I can't hear you, what you say? (Boy speak up)
Paper chase, take a break I wanna race
Andale, dope all up in my momma place
I'm in the trap like Spider-man to save the day

[Hook]
Jumped in my coupe and I can't even steer
(I hit the gas)

[Verse 2]
Project baby
Goodness gracious, Uncle Sam (That's so funny)
Bought me some Gucci Penny loafers
I don't even wear them (With some money
Bought me an Audi, got no license
I still drive it (I be speedin')
Peek-a-boo, I lost my roof
Help me find it! (Because I need it)
Ferragoma, I rock Prada
I wear Robin (Rock designer)
I'm on lean, I don't sleep
I'm on molly (I'm a sniper)
Why you flexing? Boy you stressing
Nigga stop it (You need to quit)
This so foreign, I can't work it
Help me park it (I don't get it)
Pour a four out the seal
Moving slow (Just like the Matrix)
Remember we can't pay the bills
We was broke (Now we can pay them)
Now I'm that guy, I'm so high
You so low (Boy you low)
I be swimming in that money
Boy you broke (Catch my blow)

[Hook]
Jumped in my coupe and I can't even steer
(I hit the gas)
Got Ferragamo hanging off my rear

I'm in the place...Kodak boy I ride with the k, 1k...I throw up the k, hold up the k

[Hook]
Everytime I get a good girl I just push her away
I go to falling in too deep then I be running away
I was riding with the fire had to put it away
Them crackers back on my ass they wanna put me away
They gone look me up then hook me up and book me today
Had a kind lil heart the streets done took it away
Hypnotized watching all my niggas cooking the ye
I done sewed up the game I went to pushing the weight
Mama said the streets done took me away, took me away, took me away.....took me away, took me away

[Verse 1]
Ma you know it ain't nan
I'ma lil soulja I be mad that we struggling
Everybody happy and they glad that we wasn't
Now I'm in the jag I don't brag but I love it
When I ride past it look like i'm just stuntin
I just want the cash cause everything else coming
I just wanna kick it don't be thinking that we punting
I just wanna hit it one time and then I'm running
I be on a mission for them big face hunnids
Tryna stack them blueberries up like a muffin
Tryna hit ya kidney I be all up in ya stomach-
She wanna run away like Harriet Tubman
Niggas wanna hate I just wanna get money

[Hook]
Everytime I get a good girl I just push her away

Had a kind lil heart the streets done took it away
Hypnotized watching all my niggas cooking the ye

Mama said the streets done took me away, took me away, took me away.....took me away, took me away

[Verse 2]
Short nigga....I got long pistols

In my own lane niggas all in my rearview

These niggas ain't 100 they won't thug witchu
I watch my niggas stack a block

I ain't have a ride I had to jack a car
Lil nigga so fly call me avatar
Lost a sack bounce back like a basketball
Before I got on my feet a youngin had to crawl

[Hook]
Everytime I get a good girl I just push her away
I go to falling in too deep then I be running away

 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye, she know I be runnin' it, too
Lil' shawty know I'm full of love
She know I'm bullshittin'
Aye, King, stop playin', boy, turn the light on in here

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
She know I'm bullshittin', she know I'm running the game
Lil' shawty know I'm selling dreams, she buyin' it anyway
Start some beef with me, boy, it'll be over any day
And my plug, he come from Italy, yeah he keep me paid
Everyday I'm sippin' on remedy, yeah I keep that drank
They need to free my dogs literally 'cause they in a cage
I fuck with youngins sometimes
You straight, but you got crooked ways
Life's a gamble, crushin' beans all in my ace of spades
Know I used to fuck with Sheen 'til I heard he gay
I heard a nigga stuck a broom right up his dirty ass
And, I be on a molly sippin' Grand Marnier
And, I don't like nobody, so get out my face
And, I be out here wilin', bitch, I'm young and violent
Aye, I'll get out my body, I get out my lane
I be way in Venus, I get out my space
The Devil, he be creepin', get him out my space
I'm slidin' wit' my toast, but it'll get you baked
And, I don't need a holster when it's on my waist
Yeah, I'm a hell raiser, but I'm heaven made
I'm a Gemeni, so I got 7 ways
And I poured the lean up in my lemonade
I use this shit to my advantage, call it 7 days
And I stack it like a sandwich wit' no mayonnaise
I swear sometimes I wanna tell you, but I don't ever say

[Verse 2: Humble Haitian]
[?] casino where my niggas play his spades
Niggas be like bitches, they be throwin' shade
Bitch, get out my face, don't like them anyway
Bitch, I'm gettin' money on pills, and I got laid
I'm like a horse on hay, I'm talking Mary Jane
Like Miami keep that Heat but I’m in Pompano
Nigga come 'round playin', snipers make you hit the floor
Stay strong, nigga
Bitch, I'm on my 10 toes

[Verse 3: CBE]
Front a nigga, call it "dope on layaway"
Ship it through FedEx, sell it on Ebay
My goons goin' crazy, they goin' insane
Mention my name, I'm aimin' at yo' brain
Far from you lames, we are not the same
Took a nigga bitch, he ain't seen the hoe since
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
Bust 'em in the head with the llama, call it common sense




 [Hook]

 [Verse]
My brother he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project Baby sliding those head peezy
Now everybody 'cross the globe tryna’ be me
I miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV’s
You won't understand that it wasn't easy
I be walking around with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the [?]
My ma' fell victim to the skreets, I'm sorry
I remember the school; sellin' weed in the hallway
Started skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
That when me and my G, we like Batman and Robin
God i know you lookin’ out for me through the darkness
Blood in my eyes, I’m goin' blind
Stuck in these skreets, feel like my life froze
I be runnin’ these skreets, got me dehydrated
I been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin' baby
I’m goin' blind




 [Intro]
You see me, let me tell you bout me
A nigga like me, I'm prayed for
I'm thankful for everything
God just hear my prayer, I just know I'm alive

[Verse 1]
Every mornin' when I wake, I hit my knees, and pray
I'm so thankful, I learn a new lesson everyday
I was schemin', runnin' wild, and then I caught a case
I was locked up in a cage, that's when it all came to my brain
Keep your head up, Kodak, get out there, just do your thing
Get your bread up, Kodak, you ain't got no time to play
I was fed up, lost a lot, but never lost my faith
Cause there's reason's, I go through what I'm goin' through today
Had to tell myself, "Kodak, you don't bubble, you in trouble"
Had to tell myself, "Fuck my friends, cause all I got is my brothers"
Then I told myself, "Fuck these hoes, all I need is my mother"
Cause I realize, that I wouldn't be shit without my mama
Please forgive me Lord, know you understand that it's a struggle
Just a lil boy, in these streets, got caught up with the hustle
This for my two brother's, all we got is each other
I would be nothin' without em, that's why I love em
I gotta stay pure, I gotta stay positive
Imma step up to the plate, won't run a way, like my father did
Try to put my nigga on, but he didn't stick to the code
I ain't tryin' that shit no more, I'm just gon' keep my focus on
I gotta keep movin' forward, I can't get caught up in my ways
I been lost out here like pacman, feelin' like I'm in a maze
Steady leanin' off promethazine, I ain't got no medicaid
It's destined I'm gon' see my blessings, gon' be better days
You wasn't worried bout me then, why you worried bout me now?
Thank the Lord for what I got, cause I use to wear Fila
Niggas tryna box me out, been up, but I've been down a lot
Everything is temporary, don't get comfortable in your spot
You could be droppin' your girl at work, he'll be runnin' up in your spot
My niggas locked up, watchin' the clock, I can't wait until he drop
Counting bricks up on the wall, when I talk they drop the wall
You should want me to excel, why you wanna see me fall?
I been coughin' all night, it done really got severe
They say I should get it cured, before it get even worse
So they gave me cough drops, but I'm drinkin' cough syrup
In the coupe, I'm tryna splurge, and I'm fine off the herbs
Skrrt, skrrt




 [Intro]
Kodak, institution
Shit crazy, a nigga came up slow though man you know
I tried every little hustle out here to get that bread

[Verse 1]
Came up slow, all off a caret of gold
I remember kicking doors, me and D's all hands stole
I remember we was poor, had to go get some dough
Cuban link on glo, polo, whip, my pants low
I'm too fly for you, I'm seeing through a birds eye view
I won't lie to you, she bald-headed like Caillou
All this time you was living in the skies
But now a nigga seeing right through
I'm the one gonna ride for you
I'm the one who came through
There was nobody else around
Let this shit change you, I'm the one gon hold you down
Look what we done been through, just think about everything
Thought you was my round, fuck the money fuck the fame
Ran out my wonder pain, I can't see a damn thing
My heart so cold I got ice running through my veins
Crazy how things change, you were just here yesterday
I just caught another case, I'm asking God for better days
Hit my knees and pray, forgive me for my selfish ways
I ain't mean no harm, I was tryin' get it straight
I was tired of second place, I was tryin' win the race
I just hope you understand, everyday's a paper chase
Everyday a damn struggle, you don't bother you in trouble
Thuggin' wit my brothers, on my life and the gutter
Crazy how things go, young nigga from Pompano
Can't go to jail no more, remember eating Sloppy Joe

[Bridge]
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real let me know
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real and let me know

[Verse 2]
I had ups and downs, times that with no one around
Told me stay humble, but I just didn't know how
I was just down bad, crazy I'm on now
Wanna see me locked up, its a blessing I'm home now
Deeper than zone pound, young nigga ten toes down
I be in my own lane, I go on my own route
Thras got me dumb hot, feeling like I'm on cloud
I was running wild, living fast had to slow down
I was in denial, feeling is in my foul
Fell victim to the system, free cool I really miss him
Taught me not to be a fool, young nigga keep the tool
Break your daughter heart, breaking all the rules
Learn my lesson in these streets, I ain't really go to school
Young nigga stick and move, fuck around and made the news




 [Intro]
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
I be saucin' on these bitches, I’m so smooth
Oh, I got so much rhythm
I’m so saucy

[Hook]
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how I put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor

[Verse 1]
My tongue so powerful I’m killin' em with words
But my gun be still on me while I’m layin' down a verse
Don’t know if I love this mansion or I’d rather be on the curb
Everybody keep bitin' me, they gettin' on my nerves
They lovin' my flavor, it’s delicioso
I hope you love me even though you barely see me no mo'
I don’t need ya beggin' me and eatin' my dough
So if you text me, I don’t reply I’m probably leavin' my show
And, I don’t even drink no lean and sippin' codeine no mo'
Nowadays I just be mixin' coffee with the cocoa
Aye, you can’t drop my style, got a whole ‘nother flow
While you swimmin’ in the money, I just row, row ya boat

[Hook]
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor

[Verse 2]
Swimmin' in the money, I’m a fisherman
Everybody tryna run off with my gingerbread
Niggas say we cousins, I don’t even be knowin' them
Yeah, I tried out ya sauce but you got too much sodium
Got too much sauce, no goulash
In Pluto, smokin' moonrock
Red beam on ya nose like Rudolph
Aye, you should come try my food out
I don’t make no love when I be fuckin'
I don’t even take my shoes off
And with that tool I'ma fool, I knock a nigga screws out
She wanna have my baby, yo' ol' lady love my drip
Even my diamonds drippin' (wet!)
Baby girl don’t slip
Appreciate the fan love and all of the support
They always keep me, so next time I just ain't going to court

[Hook]
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor




 [Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, Kodak
Glee

[Chorus]
Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, hoe
Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Beamer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?
She know a nigga be stuntin' like a Power Ranger

[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 2]
These ain't Ray-Bans, these Saint Laurent shades, hoe
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

[Hook]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"

Crackers took my 40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco




 [Intro]
Shit just crazy dawg
You know, when niggas fall victim to the system
Nigga get accustom to the street violence

[Verse 1]
Damn, I've been fucked up and got caught up in this life (shit deep)
I've been tryin', but I can't get my circle right (niggas creep)
It's consequences and repercussions when you thuggin' (I'm out here thuggin')
I'm doin' my thing, so now they trippin' all of a sudden (I be trippin' on em)
I ain't trippin', I'm just tryna get this money (I'm just tryna get this money)
Road runnin', state to state, I just been duffin' (I just been duffin')
Yeah, you pretty, but your personality ugly, girl
She gon' be there for me, even when I'm strugglin'
My daddy left us, left us at the house with nothin'
But I ain't trippin', I kind of like what I'm becomin'
Once a nigga get a little Fetty, boy, they comin' (you know they comin')
Ready or not, you better be ready, cause they comin' (cause they comin')
Keep it real with yourself, fuck a bitch (fuck a bitch)
You just gotta remain yourself, never switch (never change that)
I'm the last nigga left to do this shit (the only one)
Because it ain't nobody else doin' this shit (the chosen one)
I'm still workin', I ain't perfect, but I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin' though)
Mama, I don't like to see you when you cryin' (fuck you cryin' for?)
Even though I'm probably the reason why you cryin' (wipe your eyes doe)
Cause I be in some shit, majority of the time (we fine though)
Stick and movin, im maneuverin', I be swift (swift)
Road runnin', it be hard to catch my drift (hard to catch my drift)
Your life ain't tied up with a bow, but it's still a gift (it's still a gift)
You can have all the money in the world, you still a bitch (you still a bitch)
Why you out here, flaggin', like you bout that life? (he ain't bout that life)
When you want another nigga, black and white (nigga deaf as hell)
I'm just doin' what the fuck I want, cause this my life (cause this my life)
Already got it, I ain't tryna earn no stripes (I ain't tryna earn no stripes)
Now everybody wanna text me, but nobody sent my kite (ain't nobody sent me no fix)
I was livin' in the dark, but I'm just blessed to see the light
You know I hit them with that poker, but I'm special with the mic
I done took so much of losses, thought I'd never get it right (get it right)
Dancin' with the devil will have you sittin' up in the cell block
Nigga ain't give me shit, I was hittin' licks, I had to sell rock
All I wanted was some dope boy rees, fuck dem shell tops
No diversity, we just burnin' in a meltin' pot
Young niggas wylin', we just runnin round here, wreckin out
Everybody know that you get locked up, go to sellin' out
I use to fuck with bruh, I hear he tellin' now




 [Intro:]
Project Baby
Section 8
On the corner boy
I won't sugar coat, I let the whole world know

[Verse]
Where would i be if i didn't run these streets
If i wouldn't running with my heat would they still fuck with me?
If i ain't jump off that porch hotter than a torch
Say I'm a fool stop going to school, Now look I'm going to court
Hearing these voices in my head just can't ignore em
Lord help i got eviction letters stuck at my door
I done lost my mind i was kicking doors down DA want me direct file
She say I'm punishable by life
Nowhere to go so I'm in the dope pole and its getting cold
Nowhere else to go because my home just ain't home
Man my daddy out there having fun and I'm own my own
Jit gotta get right man live my life so wrong
Nigguhs tryna earn stripes so i ride all night with my chrome
And these crackers steady harassing me won't leave Lil Black alone
Man i was dropping chicos for a mil now I'm dropping songs
I get on these pills and ooh i get in my zone
I was raised round hobos 44s getting chased by the popos
Man i remember sleeping in them stolos
Dat project baby youngest nigguh out the camp
Wilding and cool ooh where would i be without them?
Just listen to me man Im'a tell yaw how it is
Im'a hit the booth tell the truth this how i feel
Ain't changing for no industry this how i live
If I keep rapping this shit for the streets i don't need no deal
And i miss my nigguh Croshawn he go hard
Shoutsout to John-John he taught me how to shoot that ball
And Angelo that my nigga though he taught me how to work that pistol
Then my nigga died and i miss him lost my nigga to the system
We was used to war, we was poppin' off takin' cars ya'll playin' around in the park
Thug holiday rest in peace Lil Purp its true them demons gone for real truth hurts
Okay just one more pill I'm on the lurk and if I'm ya boy then god tell me why i feel so cursed
And i get down and pray and pray but it just don't work
And I'm comin' to you wit my pain but it just gettin' worse
Ain't nothin' funny why you laughin'? Nigguh wipe yo smirk Man they took lil Wayne head out his foreign riding and it hurts And all them memories turn fantasy now they on a shirt
Took em off this earth just to go n put em off in the dirt
I'm a rock the verse, Swear to god Im'a put this rap shit first Even when my pockets hurt and I'm feelin' like snatching a purse
But im go hold on just gotta hold on to my dreams
Can't let my dream fade away no way i never sleep
Committing these felonies asking god for a sign am i blind to what you tellin me?
You joking boy? You better be
Cuz I whine to you when I cry to you and get on my swellin' knees
And this all that you got here for me?
But how would it be? If i would've took the good route?
And put my foot down? And shake that monkey off my hook now?
Now how would it be?
How would it be?




 [Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy Kodak, yeah, I'm fresh out, man
This that summer jam, man
Y'all slide this shit 'til school start back

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, girl, I wanna be your lover, we can do this all night, right now
But first let me get a lil' drank in me
Snapple with a lil' Henny, under the hood got a big Hemmey, vibes loud
Oh yeah, babe, you gon' feel it when you vibe with me
We all on each other, from the minute you walked in the club
I ain't gotta lie to you 'cause you know it, I think I'm 'bout to fall in love
Right now, we should get ready 'cause I'm in the mood
I'm tryna do something to you, but baby, hold up

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Look, I'm 'bout to slide on ya ass
I ain't lookin' at ya, got my eyes on the cash
Baby daddy with me, he on C class
Look, I kill the scene, dead flies on ya ass
I feel codeine in my tank
But I'ma pump 89 for the gas
Summertime niggas on the grind with the slab
Overtime nigga finna ride 'til ya crash
Baby, I ain't tryna make ya laugh
But call me butthead, got my mind on ya ass
This ain't a disguise, this a mask
This ain't a Nissan, this a Jag'
No surprise, boy, you know I'm gon' spaz
All that money gettin', boy, you know they gon' ask
I ain't finna play, put the .40 on ya ass
In a Audi thing, 240 on the dash
Your girlfriend know we got bags
Got her in the hotel, shorty gettin' smashed
It's just me and my niggas havin' a blast
Livin' fast, buyin' the things we never had
We just love stuntin', we ain't never like to brag
All us thuggin', we ain't never had a dad
I did a lot of dirt in my past
Later on the cell came, bit me in the ass
Lately I be hit the beat with the tab
Lately I been doin' shows back to back
Free Chattboy, free Cool
I'm goin' hard, I ain't goin' back to school
Bob the Builder youngin' on the corner with the tool
Swimmin' in the money, what you doin' in the pool?
Took flight, then I landed on the news
Playin' with them bands, I ain't playin' by the rules

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Wait just for a minute, I gotta check out my tab
Fuck Uber, you can sit in my lap
When we ride the Lamborghini, just hold on 'cause I'm running every red light, baby
No breaks, all gas, it's gon' be a long night, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait
You're gone, wanting your body
But it's a time and a place, oh girl, I gotta wait




 [Verse 1]
Couldn't even make it out my home, I was over thinkin'
Am I depressed or stressed, 'cause I don't even know the meanin'
Ain't got nothin' to say but why I'm jumpin' on the beat then?
Never personal, it's business, that's the way I keep it
Hollered at my clergy, he love me like his own semen
Just dropped a album but I still ain't got no time for sleepin'
I might wake up, drop a mixtape for no reason
Influence you lil' niggas, happy that you wanna be me
Know you fake, Instagram page told ya secret
No booty shakin' music when you pop my CD in
Play a crook by the book, I'm sittin' back readin'
Real recognize real, but looks can be deceivin'
I still fuck with Young Money, I'm just CMB'n
Miss my Audi, in a different Audi every season
Can't believed they flipped the Audi that I used to sleep in
Thug to the bone, you can't roll if you anemic
Brought hell on earth, my hoe know I'm cheatin'
I'm a zombie on earth, Z.O.E'n
I brought hell on earth, H.O.E'n
Zoe shit, ain't no hoe shit, I ain't H.O.E'n
I'm runnin' in the phone store, AT&T'n
I just found out my nigga a hoe, I can't believe it
'Cause I don't know the gender
Do I pimp her, do I G him?
You a transgender, I'm a wolf in sheep skin
So you was fakin' nigga?
You sit down when you peein'?
Caitlyn Jenner, shoot you in yo' legs cause you a lesbian
More stripes than Tyga, I want Kylie Jenner, tell her come with me then
It get greater later, wish my nigga was home to see this
I coulda been in Pluto but I got her sewed up in Venus
Future want me Freeband Gang, I can't 'cause I'm SG'n
Sleepin' and I'm geekin', sometimes I don't even feel like breathin'
How the hell I'm in a cell?
Was I ever home or was I dreamin'?
Woke up seen a demon
Walkin' like I'm Jesus
I pay lawyer fees, you just tweetin' "Free My Niggas"
I post commissary, I don't need to post a picture
Woe I'm in yo' corner 'til the world blow, I'm with ya
But I hope that I don't go broke again, nigga I'm killin' young babies
Kodak never goin' broke again, nigga you a free agent
Better have that same energy when you see me cause I'm goin' super saiyan
Reminiscin', wishin' my lil' brother wasn't incarcerated
Ya birthday Sunday, we just always end up locked up, ain't it?
With me on MTV on the red carpet, two lil' project babies
Yeah, at the VMA's we was the only ones taken
When this shit gon' end? I get out, you go in, it's crazy

[Outro]
Silence keep cloudin' me
Hands on my heart, it's soundin' like it's poundin' like the beat
Time never mattered
Time is money, I wish I could buy back all the time I gave away for free
Tunnel vision now, cause they was cloudin' me
I'm feelin' on my chest, I coulda sworn I felt my heart just beat
Yeah, time is money, diamonds on my Audemar
I can't keep makin' the system richer, they keep takin' time from me
