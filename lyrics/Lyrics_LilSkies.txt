[Intro]
Yeah, it's hip-hop
Hip-hop
Shout out to my pops
Mike Skies
And guess what, I'm back nigga
And I'm back nigga

[Verse]
I'll take you back to the 90's, I'm a 90's baby
White T's and black beanies like I'm Slim Shady
Sipping Mellow Yellow while I feed my dog Jell-O
She got twelve heads and tryna talk, oh hell no
Flip the script on hip-hop, now you can't read my words
Added verbs, now my punctuation curves
Sitting by the curb eating Nerds while I'm feeding birds
Better swerve or get served
Boy you ain't got the nerve
I see demons try and take my soul
I fought a leprechaun just so I could take his gold
The greatest ever told is really getting old
These boys nothing but mold around the [?]
But check my method, I just perfect it, never neglect it
You get the message
My fan base fat like Precious
I be writing rhymes in school so I don't pay attention
In detention mind floated to a new dimension
Hip-hop's my medicine, I love to overdose
Flying coast to coast with the Holy Ghost in a silver boat
Spent my weekends writing rhymes in my basement
Now my flow dangerous, I'll leave you in the pavement
Vamp life so we never sleep at night
My mind's full of parasites
Is that what you call paradise?
Dudes be looking shook like a pair of dice
You claim you dope but these other niggas don't think you're nice
Middle fingers to the niggas that be hating
Out here making changes but we ain't the ones that's changing
We steady elevating
It took some patience
Now bow down to greatness
You say your flow's sick but honestly it's constipated
Listening to some Big Daddy Kane
On my way to play basketball with my nigga Blaine
We ain't the same but we think like we got two brains
Maintain to spit flame, now we bout to reach the fame

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm eating donuts with your mom
And that's just how it go
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
Shout out to the fat dude that shoots my videos
I forget your name though
By the way what up Phil
Peace to all my 'nillas, let's go




 [Intro]
It goes 1998, 1998
Lil Skies another verse to kill
Mac Miller, let's go
It goes 1998, 1998

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
See I be steady rhyming, my timing is always over shining
Mix the rhymes up with some coke and lace the verse, I call it science
Niggas be lying in this jungle just to be the king
Diamonds and pearls, my (bitches) they rocking the finest things
Define my name, Lil Skies about to change the game
Gold chains and a smart brain, I swear we not the same
Broken promises and shattered glass in my past
She drinks Ciroc out the bottle, she don't wanna pass
Forever showing my effort, you dudes irrelevant
No weed in my lungs, my thoughts straight intelligent
I hopped over an elephant like I'm heaven sent
Remember when I was broke and didn't have a cent
But now Lil Skies on that old school shit
My fans heard the song and they like "This that hit"
Keep the beats coming, I can write real quick
Hold up let me try and change my flow a little bit

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
My team is rebels, we throwing the finger to the devil
Pedal to the metal
We toss these niggas just like some peddles
Eat 'em like he's Jell-O and treat this nigga  just like a [?]
We don't got no time for you fakes so we hit 'em with the kettle
We making money and smashing all of you dummies
My squad's full of gorillas, your squad is full of bunnies
We came up from being bummy
They laughing but what is funny
We eat 'em just like some gummies
While the day is bright and sunny, look
The dope spitter with Phil, see I'm a mic killer
I'm high on life and I promise I don't need skrilla
I smash Insta, Facebook, they all shook
Rappers stealing my style, they act like straight crooks
My shawty got a nice body, she say I'm cocky
I meet her all in the lobby, we stunting like it's a hobby
I walked in, walked out, she calling me "Papi"
By the way I beat it up some kind of like a Rocky

[Bridge]
I'm sicker than your average, average
Who's really the shit?
1998, 1998
And it goes like
Sicker than your average, average
Who's really the shit?
1987, 1987

[Verse 3: Dirrty Phil]
Seizing the moment
These pussies rapping I don't condone it
Just step up and own it
Hit the track fast like a locomotive
And my tactic splash back cause my style is so explosive
If you need the white boy with the heat, then I'm the one to go with
The dope spitter with Lil Skies, it's Dirrty Phil
We been making hits like the Thriller way I'm vanilla 'nilla
No second guessing, I'm spitting just like a llama stressing
Hotter than some lava shooting from the [?] Armageddon




 [Verse 1]
I-I live my life like I'm Gucci
Rolling my drugs it's a movie
Unload the clip out the Uzi
She popped a Xan feelin' groovy
Show me her titties she motivated
I'm off this weed feelin' medicated
We took some time gettin' hella faded
Back in the day she was educated
Back in the day we go to the land
She Tinker Bell I'm her Peter Pan
I-I count the money, she roll my grams
She wanted sex cause she is a fan
Panties and bras on the ceiling fan
She gave me neck didn't use her hands
Backwoods and condoms stuffed in my pants
I know I got it cause I'm the man
Lately I know, I go to places that niggas can't go
I had a girl but that bitch she got old
I'm in my zone so please leave me alone
I got a buzz of the lean I feel slow
Niggas be talkin' I know they be broke
I hustle hard this the life that I chose
Girlfriends get boring and so do these hoes
If I am smoking it's straight out the O
Kush my cologne cause it's all in my clothes
If she a thot than she will be exposed
Kicked her ass out without wearing no clothes
I'm in the hills watchin' y'all from above
I hang with thugs and they all show me love
Ride for my niggas, I'll let off the slugs
And fuck everybody who killin' my buzz, you killin' my buzz

[Hook]
She is a thotty, she movin' her body
She all on my dick, now I'm feelin' so cocky
I look at these niggas and tell them to stop me
I'm always lit it's gon' be hard to find me (Be-be hard to find me)

[Verse 2]
I shine like a diamond I shoot like I'm tommy
My goons right behind me
I did that bitch grimy it was perfect timing
I'm lit like a lighter, my whole life a fire I fuck like a tiger
No Tony the Tiger, to me she a liar
I'm back to my old ways, back to my old ways
She want some foreplay give her that Monday
She comin' back Tuesday, today is a new day
Her diamonds Blu-Ray, she drinkin' the D'Usse
She got on top gave me head like a toupee
Her lingerie gucci, we shootin' the movie, shootin' the movie

[Hook]
She is a thotty, she movin' her body
She all on my dick, now I'm feelin' so cocky
I look at these niggas and tell them to stop me
I'm always lit it's gon' be hard to find me (Be-be hard to find me)




 [Intro]
Aye, aye, atomic bomb, whoa
Bitch get off my song, whoa
Look at my charm, whoa
Flexing broke my arm, whoa
Bitch I'm the one, might get aggressive for these funds, whoa
He talk for fun, but why we pull up and he run, like

[Verse 1]
He coming for me
It's easy to see
Because I am a beast, bro
I take all the beef
And rip it to piece
And stomp on the street
Nigga you say you the man
But act like a bitch
I don't understand
I fell in love with the bands
Got models in France
Still wanna dance
She was high off the dabs
She want me to smash
Hop in the jag
I had to go get a bag
Now these niggas mad
They going out sad
I'm tryna go to the moon
I'l fuck on that bitch, if she don't suck dick
Then she can't come to my room
And she is a witch, 666
Might fly away on a broom
And you did me dirty
So when you die
Imma go piss on your tomb
I hang with the creatures
I don't do leisures
We gonna skirt off and go zoom (ZOOM)
Eating steak and caviar
With a foreign bitch by the bar
Drop the top just to look at the stars
You wasn't here, didn't care from the start
Don't come around and start playing your part
Look at my diamonds they shine in the dark
Labels keep calling they know imma spark
Jump in the crowd, I can't fuck with the stage
I fell in love with the race
Sweat on my body, tattoos on my face
Start a riot and go beat the case

[Chorus]
I'mma do me you can't change my mind
I was rolling off a pill like it's the perfect time
Come and rage with me, it's a lovely vibe
It's a rave outside, it ain't hard to find
(x3)




 [Hook: Lil Skies]
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Take up my time
They talkin' shit through the 'vine
Don't let it get to my mind
Chills down her spine
She play it back like rewind
I see the heights and I climb
Not 'fraid to jump
I got the work in my trunk
Roll up a 'Wood of that skunk
These niggas suck
How you talk that but gave up?
She look good with no makeup
She's not a Barbie, she's not a groupie
She's not a girl that you see in the movies
Is he a rockstar? He got a Uzi
He's with the bad guys and he is shooting
Thought he was winning but he is losing
She like the ballers, dudes who be hooping
I was on lay low, stacking while moving
I like the good ones, sorry for choosing

[Bridge: Lil Skies]
She's a good girl, she do what I say so
We both grind and go get those pesos
Say she fell in love, he might fuck her by the rainbow
We know that these lames know
They ain't ever getting close
I inhale the good smoke, blow it out the window
I brought the whole gang with me, this is for my kinfolk
You was always lane switching, thought you was with this side
No you can't be choosing sides, I am just too out of sight

[Hook: Lil Skies]
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Woke up in a big old white mansion, I make Obama moves
My chick so bad but still fuck me like she got something to prove
If you be good to big Gucci then I'll be good to you
I'm not too hood for you baby, I'm just not into you
I don't want no mediocre, I'm not no average joker
Big old white diamond choker, I think I'm Casanova
This ain't no interview, lady, you asking crazy questions
They see me flexin' VVS's in my diamond necklace
McLaren drivin' reckless, Trap God don't miss your blessin'
Good girl come get your lesson
Lil Skies these bitches tellin'
I sold so many records
I know so many felons
Now I see these bitches checkin'
Now I see these niggas jealous

[Hook: Lil Skies]
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me




 [Intro: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony, yeah, ayy
Out on my balcony, yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony

[Bridge: Sprite Lee]
You had a sign bitch
I had to buy it
I know a lame nigga when I one
And your pockets are on my list
I'm on my balcony, you ain't invited
I am the captain now, you just a pirate

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I had to lay low
Stack up my pesos
I gotta watch out
They in the raincoats
They want a casualty
This ain't the end of me
I got the remedy
Cook like a recipie
Walk on a tightrope
Sip lean and die slow
My pockets line dough
My wine like Michael
Lay low and sip my tea
She wanna fuck on me
I let her suck my D
She gon' remember me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony

[Verse 2: Sprite Lee & Lil Skies]
I put my coupe in neutral when I drop top
She won't leave me lone, I still like to bump up
I cut that bitch off, I'm just like a crop top
I shut the lanes out whenever I hotbox
Don't be afraid of heights
Are you the savage type
Don't ever tell me lies
Just let me catch a vibe
Don't know what's wrong with me
Something got into me
They say I'm hard to read
Friends turn to enemies

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony
I know

Hopped in the car, sped off too fast and almost crashed my whip
The cops come for me, then I'm silent I could never snitch
That's on Rakim, nigga

 [Verse 1]
Aye
Niggas out here talking crazy
All that talking, never phase me
Might fade to black like Jay Z
Might pull up in a new coupe with a white girl named daisy
Yeah, I came up from nothing, nigga
Made something, nigga
It's amazing, yeah
We goin' at it again
Fucking her and her friends
I did that shit with my mans
And this shit ain't part of the plan, yeah
I got the fans from Japan
Kicking shit, no Jackie Chan
I got the pounds for the land
Flip it up, and watch how I stand, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got the word from my OG
Don't be talking because niggas be police
They gon' judge me and act like they know me
But I know that these people be phony
I was stuck and they left me by my lonely
They was laughing, I was never joking
Driving fast in the coupe and i'm going
Rolling OG and Kali and smokey, yeah
I gotta know if it's real
Cause all of these people be lying
And I see that shit as defiance
And this shit is not rocket science
I answer my haters with silence
Cause this shit could end up in violence
These niggas be talking and wildin'
Get this money and go buy an island
Mama told me she want all italian
Ima' get and buy medallions
Never changing for money and wild shit
Never fold on my bros on the pilots
Swerving fast in the coupe, I got mileage
Remember days when I wish that I was poppin'
I'm smoking gas in the tropics
They can try me, this shit never stopping
You wanna know what it's like
When I was not taking advice
Nigga I put in time for this life
If you trying, bro, aim with the pipe, bang
She wanna stay for the night
I put the henney on ice
This shawty just cut out the lights
And I know she knows what we both like
Not an act of these niggas, we spy
Get that bag and I go for a hike
If you try me', we puttin' up fights
Fuck nigga, we hungry like mike
Don't fold when you hit that light
Please turn when you make that right
She's cold her heart, like ice
One night might change her life, ya

 Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, the horoscope
Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm a ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push the start
Come right in, let me break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no one, I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober, still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders
Comin' out bolder, yeah, I'm comin' our bolder
I ride with my soldiers, ride for my soldiers
Thought that I told ya, I thought that I told ya
...




 [Intro]
Girl, never lie to me
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Duck from the flashin' lights, watch out when the tide comin'
All these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really tell me somethin', ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

[Verse 1]
Rollin' cookie in L.A., I think I found my bae
She roll my weed, so she gonna be hard to replace
We takin' shots of that Henny, I don't need a chase
Almost forgot where I'm at, can barely feel my face
Rockstar lifestyle, might just die tonight
If I was down and had nobody, would you sacrifice?
They said loose ends break friends, I ain't tryna fight
Fuck bein' sober, girl, come over and enjoy the high
So don't fuck up the vibe, don't ever waste my time
And when I'm feelin' down, will you come stay the night?
And if you far away, then will you book a flight?
My neck flooded with ice, she grip it like a vice
Can't ever play it nice, the world so full of lies
And I'm not bein' them, 'cause I'm just not that guy
You wanna be somebody, so put aside your pride
So open up your eyes, they talkin' from outside

[Chorus]
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'
I take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

[Verse 2]
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'
I know they hatin' on me 'cause I really came from nothin'
I just wanna talk to you, can we have discussion?
Why you frontin' on me, shawty, better stop the bluffin'
You better stop the bluffin', I really know you want it
You push that thing up on me, so I'ma jump up on it
I ain't gonna fake it because I know I want it
These niggas so 50, I keep my shit a hundred
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie
And you know we up in the sky
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie
And you know we up in the sky




 [Intro]
Menoh
Blame on me, no shame on you
No shame on you, blame on me no
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Why you like to lie, shawty, you know you impressed
See you fuckin' with me now 'cause I bossed up and I flex
All they like to do is talk when they knew that I was next
I just come up with these hits and lay low, collect my checks
She fuck with solid niggas (aye)
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys
Watch my back, niggas lurkin', my girl look better in person
And she still picture perfect, dip and dash when we swervin'
Oh me, oh my (oh my)
Put my hand on your thighs (your thighs)
If I come through tonight (tonight)
I'll make you touch the sky (the sky)
Don't need to wink my eye (my eye)
No, I'm not even playin' (I'm not playin')
You know just what I'm sayin' (what I'm sayin')
Got you and all you cravings

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Hold my wrist up out the coupe, two bitches switch-a-roo
That pussy good, I'm blamin' you, you drippin', shame on you
She got real water (water), head real smarter (head)
Think that bitch from Florida, you probably can't afford her
Bentley truck might park the coupe, I'm livin' comfortable
Told money then I'm stuck with you, no I'm in love with you
Plug pull up in the UFO, no small talk, I'm the CEO
My bitches is bad, they do the most
She way too foreign, straight off the boat
I put her on top, she leakin', she leakin'
Turn to a freak on the weekend, the weekend
Blame on me, no shame on you, girl you can't hide the truth
I might get a 'Rari coupe, but just to flex on you

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh

Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Gotta get my J's on, gotta get my J's on

[Verse 1]
Getting paid, you Minute Maid
My shoes fresh bought like lemonade
Two pairs of Vans, three pair of J's
I'm known around for my shoe game
These other dudes, they too lame
Kicks from Japan, they too strange
Two white girls that go insane
That fast life, I'm switching lanes
I talk a lot cause I swag a lot
We 30 deep in the parking lot
Jean jackets and snapbacks
These ratchet women just hit the spot
Walking in Zumiez, they now the name
Haven't blown up, I got the fame
Hating on me dog, I am not to blame
Don't compare me dog, I'm not the same
Dope shirts and fresh shoes
Bad woman, that's good news
Got my own style, I pick and choose
We win so much, y'all always lose
If this song is just magic
Any beat I'll trash it
These rappers in the DMV are dead
Now bring them caskets boy

[Chorus]
Lace 'em up, Machine Gun Kelly
I am fresher than some veggies
There ain't nothing you can tell
Wipe me down like you wiping off a Bentley
I'ma go and hit up Zumiez
Watch me spend a couple centuries

[Hook]
Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on

Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Gotta get my J's on, gotta get my J's on

[Verse 2]
Man this house party straight bumping
Everybody straight stunting
I'm turnt up to the max, brother you can't tell me nothing
See we flexing hard like every day
Women love my crew in every way
Hater talk but the talk fades away
Everybody got their hands up screaming "Hey!"
Money making, booty shaking
Living life feeling like I'm famous
I told you once, ain't gonnaa tell you twice
Lil Skies is just really bound to make it
But forget the paper, I'm wearing Taylors
Laughing to the store while I see them haters
No new friends so forget the fakers
We balling like Spalding and the Lakers
See I'ma go and get it
Been working all of my life and my work is never finished
I'ma keep on grinding cause the grind is always endless
With my head up to the sky because the sky is the limit
Watch me get it boy

[Chorus]
Lace 'em up, Machine Gun Kelly
I am fresher than some veggies
There ain't nothing you can tell
Wipe me down like you wiping off a Bentley
I'ma go and hit up Zumiez
Watch me spend a couple centuries

 [Intro]
Ooh, yeah
It's all we got nigga
It's all we got nigga
Tell them fuck niggas to stop hatin'
Ooh, they know, uh
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Hook]
Drippin' out the sauce, see I'm leanin' over (ey!)
You gotta get her drunk, but I fuck her sober (ey!)
My plug just got a call, I met him by the border (ey!)
You fuckin' with them niggas, girl, that's what I told ya (ey!)
Drippin' out the sauce, see I'm leanin' over (ey!)
You gotta get her drunk, but I fuck her sober (ey!)
My plug just got a call, I met him by the border (ey!)
You fuckin' with them niggas, girl, that's what I told ya, ey (ey!)

[Verse]
Pull up in the foreign on some cool shit, ey
White bitch with me, call her Cool Whip, ey
Goons move that 8-ball like a pool stick, ey
She ask me "boy, how the fuck you do it", ey
I got my bands up, don't fuck with nobody, ey
I'ma get rich and be a somebody, ey
And now these bitches on me, get the fuck up off me, ey
I kick it like I'm Jet Li and my bitches cocky, yah
She hot like Wasabi, yea
Should have seen her body, yea
She got on my Johnny, yea
And roll me like a Harley, yea
All these bitches thotties, yea
I can't trust nobody, yea
Only trust family, yea
You don't look familiar, lol
Nigga's hatin', who are you?
Being careful when I move
I was writing rhymes in school
Teachers callin' me a fool
I stepped out, I got the juice
I hate bein' number two
And I still scream "fuck the world"
It's just me and all my crew
She like me, I'm not the same
I put diamonds in her chain
And you rollin' with the gang
Roll my wood and spark the flame
Tell my parents that I'm good
I don't need no nine-to-five
I just need a couple bands
So I had to step outside
Smokin' Tooka, I can't stress
Talked to God, he said I'm blessed
Niggas actin' like the best
Tell them niggas step correct
Met my plug on his ship
I ain't talkin' rocket ship
New kicks, I almost trip
Shawty like my swagger drip

[Hook]
Drippin' out the sauce, see I'm leanin' over (ey!)
You gotta get her drunk, but I fuck her sober (ey!)
My plug just got a call, I met him by the border (ey!)
You fuckin' with them niggas, girl, that's what I told ya (ey!)
Drippin' out the sauce, see I'm leanin' over (ey!)
You gotta get her drunk, but I fuck her sober (ey!)
My plug just got a call, I met him by the border (ey!)
You fuckin' with them niggas, girl, that's what I told ya, ey (ey!)




 [Intro - Lil Skies]
Uh, one time for the, one time for the
Huh, one time for the
Look
[Lil Skies]
I'm wearing all gold like a king
Rubies with the diamond rings
Fuck the bling, chasing dreams and serving them to the fiends
I'm a
Minor in his cold mind with the cold mind of Einstein, dropping knowledge every line
I'm god
They can't tell me nothing
Why is you bluffing?
I'm the topic of discussion
Faded off this robitussin
I'm a Nikon to my youth, lyrical in the booth
Captain of my troops
Letting loose, I'm busting on her tooth
My flow nasty and grimy
Promise I'm back at it, smashing all you rap faggots who always been backstabbing
Teachers told me 'focus', but fuck it, I'm writing lyrics
Raising spirits, holy and gifted, I hope you hear it
I only fear god in the odds of being odd
Without a prod. reppin' everyday like it's my job
I know that's the motion, wrap my Jimmy in a trojan
Before I swim in the girl's ocean
It's funny how they think they know me
My mind's suicide, yet, I'm feeling too alive
See me and Neek we rise but y'all hate
Niggas faking
Wanna be a Jason
Working on my education
Tryna make it to my destination
But me being me, I just wanna get high
Ride past pretty bitches here in Malsay High
But, hey!
Life's a game but this ain't no fucking 2k
Don't give a fuck about what you say
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
Said, I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
Im chucking up th-
[Neek]
I'm having visions of givin'
Givin' up on this competition
And saying, 'fuck it man' and givin' in to the opposition
But then I start having visions of how I was sitting
At my desk in sixth grade writing rhymes in my composition
Of the curvin' life I'm livin'
If that ain't too fulfilling than I don't know what's appealing
It's like everytime I write
My future life becomes revealing
But, it's crazy 'cause the future is still so concealing
Layin' back with my eyes on the ceiling
Can't even tell you what I'm fuckin' feeling but I'm thinking 'bout a million
A million damn ways to help my mom care for the children
New cup, new crib
Yeah that's a good-ass feelin'
Givin' up on the world
And no longer givin' a fuck 'bout a girl
'Cause when you worry 'bout girls
That shit will fuck up the world
Cause you gon' say 'you my world'
Then buy her diamonds and pearls
But in the end, she gon' switch up
Man, that's the way of the world
[Neek & Lil Skies]
So don't be trustin' these girls
They all they slick but greasy like Jheri Curls
On a scale from 1-10
We masterminds with the pen
As we sit in the wind
Write rhymes they comprehend, so
[Lil Skies]
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
Bitch, bitch, bitch, haha!
I'm chucking up the deuces
Neek we ballin' in a new way
I pull up with a new wave, a new wave, a new wave




 [Intro]
Yeah, woa-
Woah
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Roll up my Backwood and let me get high (get high)
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice (sacrifice)
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie (damn lie)
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie (damn tie)
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind?
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside (feel inside)
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right (feels right)
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

[Verse 1]
More ice
She wanna stay the night, tell lil shorty, "Catch a flight"
I was down and MIA fuckin' bitches, actin' trife
You wanna be my wife, ride it like you ride a bike
All this money in my hands, I'ma throw it on the ground
Like it when you back it up but better when you take it down
What don't break me only make me, smokin' OG out the pound
I got niggas that will shoot but if cops come don't make a sound
So, I sit back and watch, pray I see another day
Got Gucci with Supreme, shawty different in her way
Rock Chanel all the time, we go shoppin' in the Bay
East side in PA, they ain't loyal where I stay
So I'm out here layin' low, dodgin' vibes that I don't need
Everybody want somebody, don't confuse that with your needs
Send a message to my shorty, this ain't workin', gotta leave
I've been up, hardly sober, so let me

[Chorus]
Roll this Backwood and let me get high (get high)
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice (sacrifice)
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie (damn lie)
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie (damn tie)
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind? (on your mind?)
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside (feel inside)
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right (feels right)
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight (even tight)
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice (sacrifice)
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie (damn lie)
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie (damn tie)
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind? (on your mind?)
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside (feel inside)
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right (feels right)
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

[Verse 2]
No, no
You actin' like my bro, but you really gonna fold
I ain't tryna make no friends, I've been lonely down this road
I've been ridin' through the Hills, takin' views through the scope
Thumbin' through this cash, yeah, flexin' on my ex
And I can't get no rest, nah, I'm tryna be my best
I'm a monster in the flesh, think she want me 'cause I'm next
And I don't worry 'bout her moves 'cause she know I ain't pressed
Lately I've been stressed, press reset
I've been in the mix, let me pop a Percocet
Baby, let's get drunk and fuck like we first met
And I ain't got no plans when you slide and send a text

[Outro]
Yeah (yeah), ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
Roll up this Backwood, just let me get high (get high)
Yeah, I just need to get high
I don't care what they say, I gotta get high (get high)




 [Intro: Lil Skies]
Yeah, SKG
D-2-double R
And it goes like...

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Back on the mic, dog you know that I'ma keep it real
With dope flows, it's Lil Skies and Dirrty Phil
Filthy dirty entertainment dog our bars kill
I gotta say I'm high on life and I don't need a pill
I go crazy, it seems lazy, I get gravy
Wherever the money [?] and my whole team's shady
Your girl loves us because our swag is so wavy
Being king ain't that hard, you just gotta work daily
My team's in the building when your team's outside
Me and Phil we in the cut like Peroxide
The most dopest on the mic who don't get recognize
But we keep it real inside, eating you rappers alive
I go hard, money's always been my object
All these rappers broke like elevators in the projects
Okay this is how I feel when I go insane
Burning fire using flame
Turn that beast up in my brain

[Hook: Lil Skies]
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em

[Verse 2: Dirrty Phil]
What they talk about, son I said I been the sickest
I eat these rappers up, mm mm delicious
You know the dealy, it's Philly Philly and Lil Skies
Dopest on the mic and these other rappers are suicide
Man [?] we going do this
So much swag that I don't know what to do with
Really though, [?] flow and reservations
My mind's waiting while you're waiting, better find yourself some patience
Your facing, m blazing may cause incineration
That statement [?] I'ma take it
And even mention the fact
To when it comes to you rap dudes, you just straight wack
So go ahead, just convince yourself that you hot
When I got a million other people saying that you not
I got that, mic check 1, 2
I giggity-giggity-get it boy, how bout you, huh?

[Hook: Lil Skies]
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em

[Outro: Dirrty Phil]
Ha, Lil Skies, Dirrty Phil
Yeah

[Hook: Lil Skies]
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em




 [Verse 1]
I feel like I'm 21, 21 Savage, I keep a bad bitch
Always by my side, never catch me with an average
Spent a lot of cash, coming back like it's magic
Niggas sneak dissin', Skies ain't really with the rapping
Skies got his clout up, he finessed up out the check
On god I be grinding like I ain't got nothing left
I'ma ball on these niggas, middle fingers to the ref
And I smoke the loudest pack, think a nigga going deaf
Busting juggs, got my bread up just to make ends meet
Mama told me stay inside until I walked out in the street
I don't really say too much, I just let the music speak
I'm a beast, off the leash, plotting on my enemies, yeah

[Chorus]
Fast life, fast car, drift
Good weed, taking off, lift
Slow it down, slow it down, drip
Fuck you, I don't owe you, shit
Fast life, fast car, drift
Good weed, taking off, lift
Slow it down, slow it down, drip
Fuck you, I don't owe you, shit

[Verse 2]
I feel like Ice Cube, today was a good day
These niggas straight actors, got 'em watchin' Bluray
You know how the game goes, everybody turn fake
Eyes open for the snakes and it's still fuck the jakes
Watch the opposition 'cause I know they out here lurkin'
Bitch is you a catfish, got to meet your ass in person
Heard you got a booty so I know your ass be twerkin'
And I don't give a fuck, fuck my teachers, wasn't learning
I walk up in your crib like I live there but I don't
He say he gon' catch me slippin' but I know he won't
I ain't hiding from nobody, on my mommy that shit dead
These niggas gettin' jealous, be the first to tell the feds
I'm coolin' in the cut, smokin' dope, stackin' bread
I'm always to myself, I never needed hella heads
I'm like Escobar when it comes to the fetty
Pour a four up in my Fanta, all my niggas leaning heavy

[Chorus]
This that, fast life, fast car, drift
Good weed, taking off, lift
Slow it down, slow it down, drip
Fuck you, I don't owe you, shit
Fast life, fast car, drift
Good weed, taking off, lift
Slow it down, slow it down, drip
Fuck you, I don't owe you, shit




 Snippet of lyrics

[Verse]
Before i scrape my plate, make sure I say my grace
Tryna see bright of day, my life be full of gray
No Fifty Shades of Gray, you sweet like creme brûlée
They tryna steal my swag, they tryna steal my sauce
I had to take a loss, that shit made me a boss
This journey took same time, we put in overtime
Make sure my brothers grind, so all my brothers shine
And they want me to fall, but I remain the same
I'd die for my bros, and that’ll never change

[Chorus]
You switched up for some hoes, but say you're with the game
I gotta keep my distance, ain't fucking with you lames
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I’m tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I'm tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit

[Verse]
I'll let you drive my car, make sure you drive it fast
We smoking please don't crash, the cops be on my ass
Oh, you gon' do the dash, nigga what you want
My nigga, what you want, you dont wanna front
Rolling up the wood, that's the stuffed crust
She said she fell in love, I thing we fell in lust
No I don't give no fucks, I been ‘bout my bucks
You know it's hard to trust, they want me to fuck up
That’s why I get so high, I’m working in my zone
What's real is hard to clone, my heart made out of stone
Put my life in these beats, make sure I bring the heat
They gon’ jump out they cheats, I'm building memories
‘Cause they want me to fall, but I remain the same
And I'd die for my bros, and that will never change

[Chorus]
You switched up for some hoes, but say you're with the game
I gotta keep my distance, ain’t fucking with you lames
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I'm tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I'm tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit




 [Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't think I love you, my emotions aren't the same
I'd rather be alone than go hangout with some lames
It's funny how they judge you when they see you made a change
I poured another four just to take away the pain
My friends weren't my friends, they was lookin' for some clout
I had what they wanted so they always came around
You told me you would be there but you never held it down
I'm out here bein' loyal, now I'm lookin' like a clown
I popped another Addy, now my heart is speedin' up
And I don't wanna love you, shorty, I just wanna fuck
Got angels on my shoulders, I got demons in my cup
I'm hardly ever out because it's hard for me to trust

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Bridge]
But I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos

[Verse 2]
Roll a blunt and relax, ease your mind (ease your mind)
I'ma be here for a while, take your time (take your time)
Lock the doors, spill your heart, never lie (never lie)
And they talk about me now 'cause I'm that guy (guy)
They say I needed help but I did this by myself (by myself)
Smokin' all the time, hardly thinkin' 'bout my health
I just been alone, I'm not thinkin' that it helps
They threw me in a fire and expected me to melt
I came out a warrior, I had to make it last
I'm not the type to worry 'bout a problem in the past
And I just keep on movin' knowin' that I made this path
These bitches say they love you but will switch up for some cash
I put myself in college, I was taught that that was right
Well, now I'm 18 and I see that's not my life
I'm under too much pressure, feel like I can't take advice
You only live once, fuck the rules, I'm takin' flight
My niggas in the cage, free 'em out, fuck the law
I swear when they get out, on my life, we gonna ball
You wanna be a great, be yourself, fuck them all
Explain myself too much, now I'm feelin' lockjaw

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Outro]
But I can't do no fake friends (fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake friends (fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake hoes (fake hoes)
No, I can't do no fake bros (fake bros)
I just need the pesos (pesos)




 **FULL SONG COMING SOON**

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I, write my checks in a, [??]

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Aye, aye
Make em spin around, we gon' make em spin around now
Ooh, aye, aye
I just bought a pound Ima break the whole thing down (thing down)
Ooh, aye, aye
She don't give no calls to my, my phone now
..




 [Intro]
Ayy, yeah yeah
Ooh, ayy, yeah yeah
Ayy, I hear you niggas talkin'
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 1]
What you know about pullin' up stuntin' on your ex
Niggas took me as a joke, now they take me as a threat
I ain't never givin' up because I knew that I was next
Bitches act like they ain't know me now they asking for the sex
When I come to the party everybody goin' wild
Play my song, go berserk, and then I jump into the crowd
If a nigga wanna try me, smoke him like a black and mild
I don't do the rap beef, tell these niggas watch they mouth
Call my brother, how you doin', put some money on his books
Mama told me play sports but I hung out with the crooks
Stay solid when it's scary, we don't do this shit for looks
How you rattin' on your mans, boy I swear these niggas shook
When I come to my shows everybody show me love
And my niggas in the field selling every type of drug
Boy I got it by myself, I give a fuck about a plug
Had to hustle with my brothers, now we up, they show us love

[Chorus]
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 2]
And I'm rollin' up the woods, feel the gas hit my brain
Girl your boyfriend is a lame, he ain't hanging with the gang
Nigga you don't feel my pain, double cup of purple rain
Boy I shine like Johnny Dang, pimpin' shit like where my cane
And I come from the seven, Jamesburg what I'm reppin'
Hard times had me stressin', I was quick to learn finessin'
I stayed down and count my blessings
That's why I don't come in second
Everybody stay confessin'
Fuck the cops, no I ain't tellin'
Rather see me dead broke with no money in my pocket
Niggas thought I wasn't shit 'til I stepped out, got it poppin'
If I want it I'ma cop it, tell 'em that's just how I'm rockin'
I'm a pilot in the cockpit with some foreigns in the tropics
And I'm the type to hustle, see me grind for my dreams
Need the guap, yeah the cream, get that shit by any means
Swear I pull up make the scene with a bitch you never seen
She a rider for the team, she want diamonds fuck the bling

[Chorus]
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch




 [Intro]
Woah-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Menoh)
Woah-oh, oh
Ayy

[Chorus]
Now they salty
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
Lil baby, why you fraudin'
Plant my seed, watch me grow a garden
Save your breath, I don't do the arguin'
We done came up, we worked the hardest
Why you salty?
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome

[Verse 1]
Run away, from all the pain
I tried so hard to change my ways, think I'm insane
She rollin' up my Mary Jane, she in love with me
And I'm rollin' off an Addy pill, think this controllin' me
And they said I wouldn't be shit, but I'm here
And you thought that I was up now, just wait 'til next year
I got people sendin' threats, I can never show no fear
Smoke 'em like a cigarette, see that smoke when I appear

[Chorus]
Now they salty
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
Lil baby, why you fraudin'
Plant my seed, watch me grow a garden
Save your breath, I don't do the arguin'
We done came up, we worked the hardest
Why you salty?
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome

[Verse 2]
I put my back against the wall and just scream, "Fuck 'em all"
Now that I'm up they like to call and try to get involved
I look my shorty in the eyes like, "I can't do you wrong"
You ride for me, I ride for you, that's how we get along
I see it in your face, yeah, got no time for the basic
I wish they could see it how I see it, but I'm famous
You can have my old swag 'cause every day I change it
I can't take no L's, I'm destined for greatness

[Chorus]
Now they salty
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
Lil baby, why you fraudin'
Plant my seed, watch me grow a garden
Save your breath, I don't do the arguin'
We done came up, we worked the hardest
Why you salty?
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome

When they ask me where I been my ass don't make a sound

Verse 1:
All these bitches playing games, I swear I'm not the one
And I'm manning up to all my problems, not the type to run
And I got people on my dick because I got thr funds
My exes getting jealous cause they see what I've become
Long nights hard work this is our year
I lost family to this shit, I didn't shed a tear
And I got ice all on my neck, feel like a chandelier
And when they see I drop a song their faces full of fear
And everybody thinks they know me but they not homies
I can't fuck with you if you just gon act fake amd phoney
Remember days when I ain't have it did it by my lonely
I always stood out momma said no other man could clone me
I was broke chasin' dreams, I had to make my way
I met the plug sold some gas I didn't fuck with yay
And all these niggas claim they hard but sweet like creme brulee
I didn't give a fuck cause they won't say shit to my face
I'm smoking gas, rolling wood to relax my mind
They say im different, paint my vision it just took some time
And you can judge me call me ugly but my money fine
I'm always on some flex shit she see it in my grind
And I don't know where im going, I'm just going through
She the type to say she love you then go fuck the crew
And like right to my face, I find it funny too
She tried to play me like a joke I told her april fools

Hook:
She said I just got to know
Why you acting like a hoe
Wanna keep me on the low
But im lettting people know (know)

Verse 2:
On the low, bussin' jugs wit the plug, yea

Turning up, where my gang? We go hard body
Hit the scene, take it over this is out party
Spanish john, make her wet so she call mr papi
Senorita call bonita giving sloppy toppy
Im like quavo I chase peso, only want dinero
Smoking veggie, roll it up that shit look like an arrow

Breaking hearts chasing dreams see the world different

Oh my god shawty a nudist that booty stupid
Broke her heart like I'm cupid, I've been a nuisance

[Hook]

Oh yeah, they don't understand I had to paint the vision

I got people sayin' sorry honestly I'm not forgiving
Honestly I've been a great repeat that shit in every sentence

[Verse 3]
I got bitches down to fuck me yeah they ready to go
I got people on my dick because I'm destined to blow
Can't forget when I was down that's why I sip purple rain
Niggas say I switched up, I think I needed a change
And I'm coming for revenge like I'm OVO
Coast to coast smokin' dope with exotic hoes
And I'm only 17 but I'm still the man
Don't fear man, get your bans, you don't need a friend
And yeah I'm tryna go to Texas just to vibe off the energy
Built a lotta enemies I guess it wasn't meant to be
Back on my grimy shit, she just want a wedding ring
I'm the type to lay low then pop out make the fucking scene, nigga




 [Intro: Lil Skies]
Ohh, ayy, yeah yeah

 [Intro]
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
[?]
Let me spit that shit
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Drug dealers, slug pillers, and young niggas
Sixteen in a world full of cold killers
Times are hard, moms stressing, the bills are due
We have problems with niggas who hated on my crew
Chuck Taylors and hookah pens with water vapor
Dress like a skater but smoking mics like a doobie paper
Ain't got no time for the bullshit so I let it fly
Family wanna see me go far so they yelling "Kie"
Sometimes I feel like I'm really fucking up
Then I fall back in my ways, just really depressed as fuck
Every day I wake up with a vision in my head
Tryna get my life right, I ain't worried bout the bread
It's like nowadays all I wanna do is write
And since I'm on now niggas really tryna fight
It's funny how you get cake and niggas wanna slice
Spend nights with my niggas steady rolling dice
And I say...

[Chorus]
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting

[Verse 2]
See I just can't live my life like this
That's when I wake up in the morning and I write this shit
These girls on my D cause they love the life I live
Radio shows and videos, I'm not that big
My fan base growing every day
Girls sending me nudies and I ain't even saying hey
It's like damn this is the life you get when you live this way
Niggas pull up on your side with that gun, don't play
It's crazy, I'm just so focused right now so take me seriously
Keep my head up in the clouds, there ain't no fear in me
God put me on this earth to spit this shit lyrically
Heart full of gold, music's really in my destiny
Lil Skies I'm a young legend
Praying to the lord on my knees to the reverend
I really wouldn't reckon, watch where you steppin'
Niggas tryna make hits but forgot the message
So I say...

[Chorus]
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting

Niggas be talking don't know how I live
Honestly I don't have no fucks to give, I might fuck his bitch Then send her ass back, she is a thot and that is a fact, she fucking with opps don't fall for the trap
The kitty was good till' she turned to a rat
We gon' get rich and travel the map, might just go shopping and blow a whole stack, trust me I got it don't worry bout' that, don't think shit is sweet just cause I can rap
I'm not for the talk and I'm not for the games

I wanna bitch that is more than a dame, she looking so good I'm like what is her name
Half of these bitches done been through my game
My niggas jiggy can't fuck with you lames
Niggas will switch up for money and fame
These bitches keep stopping that's part of the game
See me in public you know I stay fly
Shouts out to much like I got to get high, my money straight, but my bitches all bi
Wrap the game up I caught y'all by surprise
Lil Skies be balling I'm ready to kill

Step in this bitch, me I don't sleep cause I wanna be rich

Look at me now like I can't even trip, my heart is mellow, I ball like the Knick's
John is my shooter, he shoot and don't miss
Treat him my brother, and that is a fact
He get to work and take down to the track
Get some more work and turn that to a rack
He add it up he just never subtract
Oh my god, who are you, little bitch you're a fool
Shawty like a swimming pool, she just wanna wear my jewels
I just wanna see you dance I don't want to see your pants
Oh, she wanna touch my bandz,yeah, my jacket came  from France
Feeling like I'm Billie Jean , Moonwalk on your main hoe
If she say she feeling lucky fuck her by the rainbow  I just spit Those flames though reeboks and a raincoat
Goosing up the rango, hop out like a kango
Niggas don't want no one, and niggas don't want no beef , anybody any beat, can come and get deceased, oh my god

[Hook: Lil Skies]
I got the money and I got the music I feel so excited
My city told me I got it so I can not sit back and hide it
I'm smoking this weed now I look at the sky and I feel like i'm flying

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Shorty lookin' picture perfect, say she ready, never nervous
I wanna know like its urgent, give her good pipe when in person
You want the cars and the purses, baby girl, tell me is it worth it
I'm in a spaceship, get ready for takeoff
Can't fuck with lil' shorty, I know that she basic
She makin' my dick soft, these niggas hatin'
Said I wouldn't make it, I shine with a new floss
I got his girl in a room gettin' naked, she fuck with a real boss
When my gang walk in it's lit (it's lit), legit (legit)
Give her the D then she dismiss (dismiss), no kiss (no kiss)
You test me then you getting hit (hit), lil' bitch (lil' bitch)

And girl that's funny 'cause I know you

Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 2: Yung Pinch]
Look, she want the money and the fame, told her you gotta go
I ain't gon' give your ass a thing, she want a pot of gold
Back when I was young I had a lot of hoes
I'm talkin' back before I got this dough, now I see how they rockin'
I know how you roll now, ain't no need for talkin'
That shit gettin' old now, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these goals down, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these hoes down (hold up, wait)
Gucci down to the socks (ho yeah), that's a beach boy, baby
Pull up to the party, shawty all up on me, now she wanna date me
Said she wanna have my baby
I ain't know that was your lady oh no
I've been workin' off the clock for this shit, did a lot for this shit
Please don't expect me just to give it up
Shorty wanna rock with the kid
I gave her cock then I dipped, told lil mama go ahead and live it up

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me cause the diamonds on my chain

Rollin' dope, got the shooters in the black Explorer (how?)
She on a mission, I don't trust her, bitch's look like Dora (oh no)
I'm on a flight, met the plug, he was by the border (the border)
You say you need it, come and get it, yeah I got your order

 [Intro]
Ayy, she said she wanna roll, high
Ayy, roll one and touch the sky
What a lie
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I live a dark life, I don't let people in
They say I smoke too much, but this my medicine
Don't get the wrong impression, I'm 'bout my presidents
Rockstar my life, look at the evidence
And would you shoot for me? 'Cause I would kill for you
I like the way you dance, you got no point to prove
I shine just like a jewel, my baby that's my boo
We both is off the goop and swerving in my Coupe

[Verse 1]
Depression settin' in, so grab my medicine
The cops lookin' for it, I hide the evidence
Bitch, I'm intelligent, they say I'm heaven sent
Life feel like Hell on earth, I fly high like a blimp
Girl, why you fuck with him? You know that nigga sell
He said he got a bag, that boy is not a pill
All of my niggas up, I did this for my team
Bitch, I'm a young boss, didn't have anything
I'm tryna own a house, you tryna own a chain
Omertà still the code, I won't tell on my gang
I used to dream about it, made it reality
And you are not my friend, 'cause back then you was doubtin' me

[Chorus]
I live a dark life, I don't let people in
They say I smoke too much, but this my medicine
Don't get the wrong impression, I'm 'bout my presidents
Rockstar my life, look at the evidence
And would you shoot for me? 'Cause I would kill for you
I like the way you dance, you got no point to prove
I shine just like a jewel, my baby that's my boo
We both is off the goop and swerving in my Coupe

[Verse 2]
Lil baby fuck me good, I took her to my hood
I wish that nigga would, would throw him in the woods
My life a scary movie, I never catch a break
How you gon' help me out, then throw it in my face?
This world's a different place, my mind is like a race
I'm always on the go, I gotta let you know
That I'm a lonely nigga, no, I don't need a hoe
I only need my dough, I'm talkin' bankroll
All of these bitches fuckin', all of these niggas lame
I can't fall victim to it, I'm in a different lane
You wanna see me fail, don't wanna see me change
It's funny how it works, now you are stuck in pain

[Chorus]
I live a dark life, I don't let people in
They say I smoke too much, but this my medicine
Don't get the wrong impression, I'm 'bout my presidents
Rockstar my life, look at the evidence
And would you shoot for me? 'Cause I would kill for you
I like the way you dance, you got no point to prove
I shine just like a jewel, my baby that's my boo
We both is off the goop and swerving in my Coupe

[Outro]
Swervin', swervin', swervin', swervin'

 [Intro Hook]
Aye, she say I'm the plug, smoke my drugs, get a lot of love, fuck me in the club

We messed up, shooters in the cut, they gon' wet you up, bitch

[Intro]
Ooh, you know what I'm sayin', niggas already know I'm comin' it's all we got, shit (yuh, ooh, yuh, woah, hey, woah)

[Hook]
Aye, she call me the plug, smoke my drugs, get a lot of love, fuck me in the club
Throwin' ones, we don't fuck with dubs, niggas know what's up
We messed up, shooters in the cut, they gon' wet you up
Throw some bands on your ass you better twerk hoe
I got my niggas rollin' gas in that benzo
And on my mother imma ride for all my kinfolk
She said she loyal fuck that bitch and all her kinfolk

[Verse 1]
Pull up smokin' gas kush fresh like listerine
If I see an Op posted Taydo go and get the bean
Niggas claimin' that they gang, they a bunch of wannabes
I put ice all on my shit I guess that's why my neck gon' freeze
Fuck that bitch 'cause I don't need her, shawtey knew I was a cheater
Need a bitch that's a believer, I ain't talkin' Justin Bieber
That's why all these hoes basic, I ain't tryna save a thot
I need diamonds on my wrist and forty bitches on my yacht
Neighborhood playboy imma glow up and just flex
Teachers told me go to college but I'd rather count these checks
Always practice safe sex, in the game I'm just a vet
I don't care about respect that's why these niggas so upset
Aye, thrasher on my shirt, dirty vans on my feet
Trap boomin' in the street, runnin' laps where my cleats
Niggas know how I'm rockin', I ain't gotta say it twice
I be posted livin' life, drop a four up in my sprite, just to get me through the night (hey)

[Hook]
Aye, she call me the plug, smoke my drugs, get a lot of love, fuck me in the club
Throwin' ones, we don't fuck with dubs, niggas know what's up
We messed up, shooters in the cut, they gon' wet you up
Throw some bands on your ass you better twerk hoe
I got my niggas rollin' gas in that benzo
And on my mother imma ride for all my kinfolk
She said she loyal fuck that bitch and all her kinfolk

[Outro]
Hey, hey, woah, ooh, yuh, yuh, ooh
Oh we got shit, ooh, alright that's it




 [Verse]
I'll punch you in the back, my hands come through your belly button
These rappers got dope beats but their lyrics ain't nothing
They talk about giving love for their town and think they stunting
My team hit it out the park when your team be bunting
See I'm a kid who's tryna live a dream
This lifestyle is a movie and I skip too many scenes
But when I look back it's not as good as it seems
But I started from nothing and turned it all into a thing
But Illuminati tryna tie me in a knot
But I'll never go to hell cause I don't want my soul to rot
Cause I'm only 13, in five more years I'll be a man
And I'm gonna work hard, there's no defeat in my plans
But I stand tall, stay strong cause I ain't done son
Cause I pray to God that he lets me be number one
Cause I give more time and I think with my head
I popped up in this rap game just like some toaster bread
But on these beats I devour anybody
Who thinks they're raw when they know they're sour
You work for a couple minutes when I work for 8 hours
Go home, eat my dinner, than I take a long shower
They ask me why I act gold, cause I feel I really am
I go past the limit, go up high like I'm Peter Pan
I go hard young bull homie and I never sleep
These rappers 14 days cause they all too weak
But I just give it my all and I hope I never fall
But I'm destined for up so my team we gonna ball
When you ask me do I want to be famous? No
I wanna be legendary, that is the kid who makes the changes
I studies all the greats and gave it a lot of time
To let my bars lock up, I ain't committing crimes
In these lines
Instead I'm sitting back putting my pain up in these lines
You feel the deepness in my songs as I flow along
But you can stand under me if you don't understand
Growing up so fast I swear it's hard to be a humble man
I'm wise, you could tell when you look into my eyes
You see nothing but stars that's way up in the sky
I worked hard in my academy, you see me building strategy
I give effort, I don't care who's mad at me
Cause all this rap music is really helping me
And one day I wanna be known as a prodigy

[Hook]
Forget being famous
I wanna be legendary, the kid who makes the changes
I'm going down in history
I'm tryna be a beast
When it comes to ripping beats
Lil Skies'll bring that heat
I said forget being famous
I wanna be legendary, the kid who makes the changes
I'm going down in history
I'm tryna be a beast
When it comes to ripping beats
Lil Skies'll bring that heat

[Outro]
Yeah, making good music from the soul
We don't believe in illuminati
Just keep it real and let the beat flow




 [Intro]
Yeah, ayy
Menoh!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Wrists, dancing, sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits, grind for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted, she thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it, live my life with no limits
I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage, just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it, man, 'cause I'm so relentless

[Verse 1]
You want to hang with a rockstar, live a fast life and get high
We 'gon come through, shut the block down
Make 'em lay low like drive-byes
I don't fuck with them, they don't fuck with me
It gets to their heads but not mines
I'm my own man, I don't need no hands
Who go switch with me and change sides
Ooh, it's lit, milk the game like a tit
I put my bitch in Rick, now she 'gon ride this dick
My gang, official, no, you don't want this issue
Blast off hard like a missle, real diamonds these aren't crystals
Lil' shawty, go crazy, pull up in black Mercedes
Thank god my momma made me, boy, you's a momma's baby
The throne was set for taking, I press reset on patience
The Percs makes her amazing, soak it up like a raisin

[Chorus]
Wrists, dancing, sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits, grind for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted, she thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it, live my life with no limits
I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch, I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage, just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it, man, 'cause I'm so relentless

[Verse 2]
Senorita, she a eater, my bitch a queen like Latifah
Roll ten woods of that reefer, smoke KK Wiz Khalifa
Got music blastin' through my speakers
In the game you was on the bleachers
I don't text her back, I don't need her
You really thought she was a keeper
Woah, not sorry, flexed up with my posse
Tattoos all on my body, diamonds is playing hockey
Cold, brr, let me go up her skirt, Louis V on her purse
Sunday she go to church, she fragile, but worth it
I know nobody perfect, not lying in my verses
Take credit like a merchant
Yeah, Immortal, bandit, bitch I'm not from this planet
I need that lettuce sandwich, don't think they understand it

[Chorus]
Wrists, dancing, sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits, grind for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted, she thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it, live my life with no limits
I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage, just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it, man, 'cause I'm so relentless




 [Intro]
Uh huh, ooh

[Producer Tag]
You are watching a master at work

[Verse 1]
Look, my hard times with me and grown man
'Member when I used to hide the work inside a soda can
Cops pull me over, I ain't going, I ain't getting jammed
Stanley hitting licks just to get some money in his hand
Back on Garfield, I used to like those days
Hit the pool, fuck some hoes with my A.I. braids
Me and Cam fighting niggas, had our psycho ways
God had me in his plans 'cause my life done changed
I used to sit and think about how my ass could make a mil
I was working on the plan like, "fuck the critics and the deal"
Hate asking mom for money 'cause I know she got bills
So we started robbing niggas, but I didn't like to steal
Saw my uncle sell drugs, back then he was the plug
Everybody showed him love from the hood to the club
I used to think that shit was cool until he got locked up
And to me he was my idol, yeah, that shit fucked me up
My grandmother used to cry every time he had court
I used to hide behind the shed just to smoke a Newport
Stopped smoking cigarettes 'cause it was hard for me to breathe
Now I'm tearing down stages, making waves they believe
Fuck a trend, I don't need a friend, I just need a Benz
My loose ends knotted up, now they can't comprehend
Pray my shit stay afloat, but if not I'm gonna swim
I'ma ball on these niggas even if I'm wearing Timbs
And my mom go to work every night of her life
Her back fucked up, but, for us, she making it right
When it was dark and we ain't have it she still gave us the light
Smoking weed, hardly sober, but my future is bright
And I'm still making plays like I couldn't get a job
I ain't want no nine to five, tell me I'm my own boss
Fucked up my own bread so I had to take a loss
I ain't like these other niggas doing shit criss cross
Where I'm from it's hard to make it, but I know that I'ma make it out
Stay inside, stack my bread and figure out a safer route
Now these hoes wanna fuck me 'cause they see what I'm about
Tryna buy my moms a crib but you can sit and have your doubts
I got no time for the games, I got no time for you lames
I'm a soldier to this shit so I ain't fearing no pain
Had my head in the rain, no, we ain't feeling the same
I been working on myself, I feel I needed a change
I got shit to lose, but I ain't got shit to prove
These rappers is old news, paying for some YouTube views
(yeah, yeah, ayy)

[Chorus]
And this is what I call life
Roll my Backwood while outside
Let my shawty slide, watch the sunrise
She just wanna fuck and have a good time
And this is what I call life
Roll my Backwood while outside
Let my shawty slide, watch the sunrise
She just wanna fuck and have a good time
And this is what I call life

[Vers 2]
Tu a pris mon cœur et dit que tu m'aimais, est-ce que tu est celle que je dois vraiment croire?
J'ai dit que j'aillais m’arrêter, mais je reviens vers ce double vers
Wood après wood, je prends une taff', je peux à peine sentir mes poumons
Tu va oublier le passé et montrer a toi même que tu est fort
J'ai pas essayé de trop prêcher, j'essaye de te le faire comprendre
(j'essaye de te le faire comprendre)
Je te donnerai le monde si tu nous laisse grandir (tu nous laisse grandir)
Bonnes ondes, bons moments partout ou on va (partout ou on va)
Monte le volume, elle m'entend à la radio (à la radio)
Backrolls sur la côte est, ouais
Avec mon bébé on va trop haut, tout est sous contrôle
Nous serrons stuntin' donc vole
Je sais qu'on va attirer œil quand on marchera, mais ils savent que tu est à moi
Négro,ouais, elle est à moi

[Chant]
Besoin de ton amour, c'est ma drogue
Quand je tombe, relève moi
C'est assez (C'est assez)

 [Hook x2]
I'm at the bottom, I'm working so hard by my lonely
I look at these niggas then laugh in they face 'cause they phoney, yeah
Stressing on nothing, don't think that I know where I'm going
I saw that vision, they mad they don't like what I'm doing, yeah

[Verse 1]
Practice make perfect, thank God that I'm working
One thing's for certain, I'm living and learning
While hurting, just breaking my curses
I'm fighting my demons for reasons believe in
My life always changing like seasons
See me, I be scheming, y'all feinding
I'm sorry I'm dreaming, these goals I'm achieving
Reaching my goals
People be changing, I hate when they fold
Turn 17 now I feel like I'm old
Won't go for nothing, don't care what I'm told
I needed time, I don't do drugs
Where is the weed, Ma with some thugs
Got shooters with me, busting them slugs
I wanted peace but they don't show love
One time

[Pre-Hook]
One time for my city, hold up
Two times for my boys, hold up
Middle fingers to you fuck niggas, hold up

Ghost face nigga, I ain't talking killer
Smoke and nightmares like its MJ Thriller
She gon get freaky when I take her to the villa
Stuck up in my ways, I'm just tryna get paid
Looking back at my life, never had it made
Clean cut dude, smoking cigs in the shade
Got a clean fade now I'm always getting laid
Niggas getting jealous, I'm just getting money
Girls hit my phone while my dick up in they tummy
Step my game up, now a nigga ain't bummy
Is you gon hate me or is you gon love me?
I couldn't change
My dad acting like my manager, nothing's the same
I wish he could see the rain from all of my pain
Lost more than we gain, I'm in another lane
It is what it is, promise I'm doing my thing

[Pre-Hook]
One time for my city, hold up
Two times for my boys, hold up
No times for you fuck niggas, hold up

[Verse 1]
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu, villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah
I'm tryna cop a Benz, yeah, pull up and drop like ten, yeah
You tryna chase the life (what?) well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Verse 2]
Not a lot of love
Rollin' in the coupe and she was rollin' off the drugs
Lookin' for the one, girl, you know that I'm the plug
I be booted up with my shooters in the truck
Ayy, and broski keep it and it's tucked
Nigga talkin' 'bout it, but he never runnin' up
Put this shit in motion, so I'm never stayin' stuck
Don't be actin' starstruck every time they show you love

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup

 Part I: Money Trees Remix

[Chorus]
Me and my niggas stayin' hungry, ya bish, ya bish
Out here workin' for our money, you bitch, you bitch
Niggas prayin' I fall off, ya wish, ya wish
Gettin' full off success, no dish, no dish

[Verse]
I want gold models with gold bottles
Two fast cars at full throttle to drive me through my fantasies, uh
I need good rhymes, no dried lines
And 30 cups of red wine to understand my destiny
See me I'm floatin' in the ocean
Never coastin', they can't hold him
Fast life in the slow lane
Running'through the bread so fast they say I'm loafin'
Came up from the bottom
Young kids, we didn't really even have no options
Now thots be thottin' and all of you foo foo niggas plottin'
Came up from a came up

Part II: All of My Remix

[Verse]
Look, okay I'm all about my peso, nigga who are you?
Always gotta hustle so I watch where I move
The bills past due, the money on the table
We couldn't pay for cable, now all my niggas stable
I used to sell shoes, I used to sell hats
I tried to make that come up, but never ever trapped
These niggas straight wack so I can't trust 'em
Turn a good girl bad, had to adjust 'em
Money, power, fashion, my only motivation
Niggas tryna test me, deep down they hatin'
People quick to judge me, somethin' like I'm Satan
I've been at the bottom but I'm patiently awaitin'
To smash you nigga, I'ma nigga trash you nigga
You be rappin' like you nice, boy you ass, my nigga
Ask around boy, they tell you Lil Skies that nigga
I been grindin' too hard to come in last my nigga

Greatness they know
I'm a prodigy
Probably rocking everybody in the crowd
And I'm known to be wild so I'ma be here for a while
Chambersburg born legend
I'm bringin' niggas down like 9/11
And my verses pop off like MAC-11s

[Outro]
Uh, and it's love

Wood after wood, I take a puff, can barely feel my lungs
You gotta move on from the past and show yourself you're strong
I ain't tryna preach too much, I'm tryna let you know (tryna let you know)
I would give the world to you if you would let us grow (you would let us grow)
Good vibes, good times everywhere we go (everywhere we go)

Shawty, I could really change your life (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Shawty wetter than a forest, she gorgeous
Back it up, that thing enormous, I'm on it
I can never say it's not mine, she too fine
Shawty always let me wine and dine, like every time
Hit the mall, we buyin' Gucci, she boujee
Chain colder than a smoothie, like ouuiee
Me and shawty off that good gas, grade A
Every day it's fuckin' pay day, can I say
I been flexin' on my old hoes, it feels good
I just had to set some new goals so I could
Stunt harder than I ever have, it's so sad
Pussy niggas out here getting mad, I'm getting cash
Look at life, I'm workin' hard now, hands down
Feels good makin' my mom proud and see her smile
Boy, I'm aimin' for the stars now, no lookin' down
Since I'm up, they wanna come around, I shut 'em down

[Chorus]
I get love on the east side (yeah)
I get love on the west side (yeah)
I get love on the north side (yeah)
I get love on the south side
Thirty deep, you know how we ride (yeah)
Oh my god, she is not my type (yeah)
I just get her wet like Slip 'N Slide (yeah)
Shawty, I could really change your life (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I had to go get a check, yuh
That why these hoes gimme neck, yuh
All of my bitches finesse, yuh
In the game like the ref, yuh

She gon' do it for the team, ayy
Shawty loyal to her dreams, ayy
Like she Martin Luther King, ayy
Margiela on the feet, ayy
Shawty style too elite, ayy
She my beauty, I'm the beast, whoa
We gon' eat like a feast, whoa
Better yet, think again, ayy
Joker and Harley Quinn, ayy
Screamin', "Fuck fake friends," ayy
Me and shawty need a Benz, ayy
And it's alright
Watch my friends turn fake as they see me on the rise
I remember being broke, used to have to sacrifice
Now I'm always on my vibe even through my hard times
I know niggas ain't real
I know bitches ain't real
I can never ever lack, I just had to bring it back
We was runnin' after rags, dodgin' cops, sellin' pack

[Chorus]
On the east side (yeah)
I get love on the west side (yeah)
I get love on the north side (yeah)
I get love on the south side (yeah)

 [Intro]
Yuh, woah, hey, hey, hey, hey, yuh
Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
Aye, look at life like it's so amazing
Half famous but I knew the fame wouldn't change us
Lil Skies what they call me yeah that's what my name is
And niggas still want beef but where the fuck an angus
I'm peepin' all the fake shit, I got my eyes open
They see I play for keeps like I got the wooden token
My life fast, I'm outgoing, guess that's why I'm open
I'm single for a reason, fuck havin' my heart broken
I turned nothin' to somethin' it's crazy how it goes
From same clothes, to now I'm fuckin' the baddest hoes
From bein' lazy, to now I'm focusin' on my goals
From bad grades, to finally makin' honor roll
I made my mom proud it feels good
My chest hurts, guess I smoked too many backwoods
I'm tryna blow up do an interview with West wood
Until then I'm workin' hard because I know I should (nigga)

[Hook]
(Yuh, yuh) It's okay, and it's alright (yuh, yuh)
I made my way and still I fight (yuh, yuh)
All the pain and all the lies (yuh, yuh)
I spread my wings and still I fly (yuh, yuh)
Tell my momma, yuh, tell her, yuh, no bad vibes (no bad vibes, yuh, no bad vibes)

[Verse 2]
Look, fuck your feature I don't need your clout
'Cause to be honest I'm the greatest thing comin' out
I work hard when I say it I don't have no doubts
I took chances when they told me we was in a drought
My little brother looks up to me, gotta be cautious
I brought the wave to you niggas, made you all nauseous
My dad got himself a girl, glad he doin' well
Remember six years ago when he went through hell
As times change and my little sister is growin' up
It hurts my heart knowin' that I'm not around as much
Remember when she was little, was playin' barbies with her
Perfect Kodak moment, I wish I could paint the picture
But life's short so I'm livin' mines day by day
I'm askin' God to look over me so that's why I pray
And people look at my tweets like is that really you
Actions speak louder than words and here's my fuckin' proof

[Hook]
(Yuh, yuh) It's okay, and it's alright (yuh, yuh)
I spread my wings and still I fly (yuh, yuh)
All the pain and all the lies (yuh, yuh)
(oh shit I fucked it up) No bad vibes
No bad vibes, all summer '16, no bad vibes

Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Stay inside my house, dodgin' questions from the press
She gon' fall in love, my nigga, what did you expect?
Everybody love you when they know that you got next
Got my gang with me, we on that fuck shit
She didn't like me then, now she wanna suck it
I don't got no time, get my cash in abundance
Book me for a show, I hit your stage and get it jumpin'

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch, I got on Balenciaga
He said he ridin', I don't know him, that boy not my partner
My bitch a queen, she took a pic, look like the new Madonna
Hopped out the foreign, cracked his head, that boy look like piñata
Go crazy for them dollars, ayy, ayy

[Verse]
I don't got no time for these lames in my face
I'ma take the trophy and go put it in a case
You were talkin' down, but you just look like a disgrace
I'ma grab the choppa, get the bullets out the vase
'Fore them niggas talkin', they don't want no smoke
When I used to come around, they'd play me for a joke
Now she wanna suck and put my Johnny in her throat
I go barely in and shawty callin' me the G.O.A.T
I'm the big man, I count big bands
You sinkin', quicksand, she on a handstand
I got my brothers with me, try me, you actin' silly
Love me, but wanna kill me
Know they all gonna feel me, ah

[Chorus]
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Stay inside my house, dodgin' questions from the press
She gon' fall in love, my nigga, what did you expect?
Everybody love you when they know that you got next
Got my gang with me, we on that fuck shit
She didn't like me then, now she wanna suck it
I don't got no time, get my cash in abundance
Book me for a show, I hit your stage and get it jumpin'

Go crazy for them dollars, ah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Stay inside my house, dodgin' questions from the press
She gon' fall in love, my nigga, what did you expect?
Everybody love you when they know that you got next

She didn't like me then, now she wanna suck it

 [Intro: Lil Skies]
CashMoneyAP
Aye, aye, aye

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck
Want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin

I don't show love if you ain't showin' love
Balance my life the weed takes me above
Me I smoke weed I'm not poppin' a xannie
I fucked her sister think her name was Tammy
Tammy told Sasha now Sasha hate Tammy

 [Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
They come around me, they come around me
I don't ever doubt it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Paranoia (paranoia), yeah yeah
I can't never be there for ya, yeah yeah
But I'ma pull up on ya, yeah yeah
Just to show you that I love ya
I walk outside, throw my hands to the sky (to the sky)
Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries (hear my cries)
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise (in disguise)
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I walk outside
I just caught the wave, seen attention in their eyes
Flying like an owl, I stay confident and wise
Smoking all the time just to hide my bad side
Mama said that she gon'-gon' pray for me, but I know how that goes
I spent too much time around fake niggas and fake hoes
I feel like time flies when your life's on a tightrope
I see my problems and think I got the antidote
And yes I'm still faded
I wish I could make it but I ruined my relations
People think I'm playing when I tell 'em I'm the greatest
So much on my mind, it's hard for me to even say it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, wear my heart on my sleeve
Four grams in my leaf, blessed up like I sneezed
They don't know what I know and I know I believe
So I'ma go'n recieve, everything that I need, but my

[Chorus]
Paranoia (paranoia), yeah yeah

Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries (hear my cries)
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise (in disguise)
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm counting all my blessings
Praying every second as I fall in deep depression
And lately I been gone, feeling like I'm second guessing
Everything I worked for, is that even in the question
And I know they act like they care but they all show fake love
I need to get high so point me to the plug
I need a strong buzz so give me the right drug
I feel like nobody and that I'm good enough, huff
I had to make some changes
Wake up every morning mad because I haven't made it
See my family stressin' out, I'm working hard to change it
Go and get the stainless, take a shot until I'm painless

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, wear my heart on my sleeve
Four grams in my leaf, blessed up like I sneezed
They don't know what I know and I know I believe
So I'ma go'n recieve, everything that I need, but my

[Chorus]
Paranoia (paranoia), yeah yeah
I can't never be there for ya, yeah yeah
But I'ma pull up on ya, yeah yeah
Just to show you that I love ya

Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries (hear my cries)
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise (in disguise)
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah yeah




 [Chorus]
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi

[Verse]
Yeah, ooh
We lit in the party
I smoke a woods with your bitch
Cooling in the lobby
You see the grind, put in time
This shit never stopping
I watch my spine all the time 'cause these niggas plotting
Yeah, these bitches watching
The clock ticking and tocking
I like the way she drop it
And she let me milly-rock it
We swerving in the rocket
My bitch is too exotic
She hold her own pockets, money like ten wallets
Will you remember me, or will you let me go?
If I was 'bout to die, then would you let it blow?
This is the life I chose, can't ever trust a ho
'Cause pain is all I know
So you gon' have to go
'Cause I need all the dough
And she got all the snow
I see it on her nose
She mad she got exposed
Life of a dark rose
Don't ever hide the truth
How would I tell her different, if I was feeling you?
If I was feeling you
How would I tell her different, if I was feeling you?
If I was feeling different, how would I tell her different, if I was feeling you?

[Chorus]
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi




 [Intro]
Know
Girl, I just gotta know
Know, ayy

[Chorus]
Girl, I just gotta know, are you in it for the dough?
I'ma have to let you go, I can't trust you, little hoe
Live your life like a pop star, yeah she like to party with a rockstars
I'ma let her play and pull her strings like a guitar
Tatted on my face in Japanese, I got a cold heart
Drivin' in that foreign, there's no keys, you gotta push to start

[Verse]
Yeah, pockets so heavyweight (weight), chant me like Ali the great (great)
Love when she give me face, movin' in and outta state (state)
What I'ma do today? Hit the store, pick up lil bae (lil bae)
Shop like a holiday, these niggas can't hang with us
They tried to drop a bag and we left them in the dust
I got my brothers in this bitch and we don't talk too much
You get to fussin' out yo lip, get hit with uppercuts
We all around the map, nice cars we be swervin', I'm bossed up with a purpose
And they used to think I was worthless, now they all on me like I'm perfect
And she's not the type to be nervous, been gettin' money you learnin'
You stuck in a shell, I'm no hermit, I want more green but no kermit, huh

[Bridge]
It's your life, try to live it up in one night
Never let nobody change your mind
Sometimes you gotta make a sacrifice

[Chorus]
Girl, I just gotta know, are you in it for the dough?
I'ma have to let you go, I can't trust you, little hoe
Live your life like a pop star, she like to party with a rockstars
I'ma let her play and pull her strings like a guitar
Tatted on my face in Japanese, I got a cold heart
Drivin' in that foreign, there's no keys, you gotta push to start




 [Intro]
Ayy, yeah yeah
Ooh, ayy

[Chorus]
Nigga, I'm the one in fact, I put my town on my back
They'd rather see me broke but I'm thumbin' through a sack
They never show me love, I don't know how to react
So I always gotta keep my eyes open for the rats
I came up from the bottom, I ain't even gotta lie
I scream, fuck a job, I don't do no suit and ties
I'm always with the guys, rollin' dope, gettin' high
If a nigga think I'm lackin' then he's in for a surprise
Smokin' Pump 93, that's that fire flame
Shawty say she fuckin' with me, I don't know her name
Niggas beefin' over bitches, they some fuckin' lames
Shawty wanna take a picture wearin' all my chains

[Verse]
In Morgantown, hit the club, blowin' hella dubs
And I'ma turn his girl down if she ain't tryna fuck
And niggas hate but when they see me tryna dap me up
I got my brothers with me, they be on that savage stuff
Two pills in the hills with a foreign jawn
Shawty say she really love me but I know she don't
Countin' money, layin' low, the type of shit I'm on
She like the way I freak a beat and how I make a song
And I'ma always be that nigga, they don't understand it
Crash Bandicoot in the whip, I'm a bandit
Fuck her good, before she go she make me a sandwich
She call my phone like beat it up, I come and do the damage
Niggas talkin' like they know me, they don't really know me
I be ballin' left hand up, I hit the Ginobili
Twenty-four step back, they thought I was Kobe
I'm to myself, I can't trust you, you is not my homie
And every time I wake up I see some fuck shit
Check my phone, roll my dope, start the function
Nowadays everybody so reluctant
I can't blame you, got no time for that fuck shit
'Cause I remember back then, mobbin' on the low
We still hustle, we still grind, I ain't never goin' broke
I got people talkin' down on me like I wouldn't know
I confront them every time and they mad 'cause they get exposed
Boy you know we got it goin' on, my niggas gotta eat
I'll be damned if I'ma starve so we can take it to the streets
Niggas foldin' under pressure, swear these rap niggas weak
I ain't changin' for nobody, when you switch you get deceased
And I ain't gotta flex, I got money in the stash
You say she hard to break, bro, I already smashed
2017, I need a Rari, do the dash
The real gon' survive and the fake will never last
I pull up in that coupe, I'ma flex with your ho
I swear I'll never fold, on my brothers that's a no
We smoke it by the O, get the package for the low
Westwood with the flow, countin' up my C notes

[Chorus]
Nigga, I'm the one in fact, I put my town on my back
They'd rather see me broke but I'm thumbin' through a sack
They never show me love, I don't know how to react
So I always gotta keep my eyes open for the rats
I came up from the bottom, I ain't even gotta lie
I scream, "Fuck a job," I don't do no suit and ties
I'm always with the guys, rollin' dope, gettin' high
If a nigga think I'm lackin' then he's in for a surprise
Smokin' Pump 93, that's that fire flame
Shawty say she fuckin' with me, I don't know her name
Niggas beefin' over bitches, they some fuckin' lames
Shawty wanna take a picture wearin' all my chains

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

 [Intro]
Menoh

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skrrt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki yeah she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
Imma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Now purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that wood now she goin for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
And she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more

 [Intro]
Yeah yeah, ooh ayy
Man I just woke up like fuck it
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Wake up getting this cake
Oh she love me, no I can't relate
And they hate me cause I made a way
If you try me, I go where you stay
With my brothers pull up to the land
She gon' see me and fuck for the bands
I can't love you cause you is a fan
See me dancing, that's my money dance
I'm Italian, my shorty from France
I'm in Cali just getting a tan
Say she love me but follow my mans
Shawty high must be off of the xans
Say I rock and play her like a band
Just relax shawty hear what I'm saying
I got brothers like it's taliban
It's a party, bring you and your friends
Need a coupe but my bro want a benz
Fuck her sister, I thought they was twins
Fuck it, I'll probably do it again
Count my blessings, wake up, and I sin
I sip Henny, can't fuck with the gin
Sending shots, he won't aim for the rim
Sending shots, he won't aim for my brim
He a loser, I know he can't win
In all black and my car got the tint
Everyday I wake up and get bent
My life's crazy but I don't repent
Say he loyal, I know he gon' switch
Nigga either you real or a bitch
You a actor, just wanna be Mitch
Life's a game and my TV don't glitch
Rolling up watching Lilo and Stitch
I got juice and my shawty do too
She a rider, get high in my coupe
And I know niggas hate how I move
They be jealous and that is the truth
Boy I know I don't got shit to prove
She got blues, I ain't giving her clues
Pay attention, don't step on my shoes
I got swagger, don't mean to be rude

[Hook]
What, bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool
What, what
Bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool

[Verse 2]
Ayy, she wanna go to a party
She feeling good off the molly
She getting right off Bacardi
And now this girl acting so naughty
And I got my hands on her body
And she ride me, she feeling so jolly
And she know that these niggas can't stop me
I'm too humble for me to be cocky
I got a hoe up in aki
I got a hoe out the way
All these bitches be all in my face
Probably why they're easy to replace
Call my lawyer, I'm beating the case
I'm a loner, be needing my space
And these niggas want all of my plays
And these bitches be stuck in their ways
On my soul I don't talk to the jakes
You a rat then you hang with the snakes
Niggas change when they come to the cake
Say they down but they really be fake
Tell my brothers I got 'em always
We was trapping in all the hallways
And we had to learn the hard way
And my life they wanna take it away
I got your ho on a J, yaa
She be giving me neck, yaa
All of these bitches be pressed, yaa
I am not giving 'em checks, nah
She wanna ride for the set
And damn I hate when she upset
And she wanna make up with the sex
They some rookies, come fuck with a vet

[Hook]
What, bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool
What, what
Bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool




 [Intro]
I know I'm higher than a bitch, I can't even front
But I ain't never had shit, that's why I like to stunt
I know that nigga hating on me, this ain't what he want
I know he tryna knock me out because I'm Number 1

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk
I Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check

[Verse 1]
I'm bout to break the bank
I make the trap jump
I'm rollin up the skunk
Your boyfriend is a bum
He say he need that work
Like pull up what's your order
I save it like a hoarder
Then go right to the border
My bitch a dime piece
Yo bitch a three piece
My niggas sellin piece
Y'all fuck with kill piece
Remember being broke
They took me as a joke
Now treat me like the pope
My life's so fucking dope
Bitch I came up, I don't flex for the Gram
Boy I ain't hiding you know who I am
Niggas be talking I don't give a damn
I text her the ??? I feel like Uncle Sam
Bro she like Curry, that 30 don't jam
I got it back now it's all in my hands
Stayed on my toes I ain't switch on my mans
Kill em, be humble and stick to the plan
I'm in the cut, I don't fuck with the VIP
These females ain't loyal, they always on dicks
Stay in the job, I can't be in the mix
They want me to fail but instead I took risks
Look at me now like I'm making them sick
Fuck all the diamonds, I shine regardless
I got the vision, yes I'm an artist
I tell em pull up cause we got the bargain

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk
I Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check

[Verse 2]
That nigga talking, I know he ain't real
Say he won't switch, bet he will for the deal
Work my ass off till my hands touch a mil
Rollin up dope, getting high for the thrill
Gave her the D now she all in her feels
Hitting my phone all the time cannot chill
I do not love you, ain't paying ya bills
She want some clout but I ain't Dr. Phil
We got in late when we came in the door
Hoes in the couch money all in the floor
Ain't running out keep the bag in galore
I shine like a star in the clouds where I soar
Funny thing is I was just by the store
Trapping with bro making plays to get more
Now I'm on flights taking trips to explore
Give me two years and I'm going on tour
It's all we got, bitch you know what it is
Now I'm the man you can't call me a kid
No looking back on the shit that I did
Hitting them licks, laying low from the pigs
Rolling up gas drinking lean like i'm sick
Bro trappin hard making plays out the whip
I'm in the studio making these hits
Chasing my dreams while they sit back and wish
Nigga you know what it is (Woah)
Nigga you know what it ain't
And these niggas ain't felt all my pain
Tell that nigga just stay in his lane
Smoking gas and it's smelling like dank
And my shooters pull up in a tank
And she love me, I'm fresh out the bank
I can't save you, girl I ain't no saint

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk
I Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check

Niggas in they feelings they be acting like they drake
I can never hesitate when it comes to the cake
I always been humble you can see it in my face
Used to pray for better days now i'm running relay
Around everybody out here acting cliche
I've been ballin on these niggas dunking like i'm MJ
I jumped in the water and I swam with the sharks
Momma told me stay inside I went out after dark
Kept a couple niggas with me riding by my side
I just want to get high, stack money, stay fly
Boy you know it's going down
Boy you know it's going down
Tell her that I need her right now
The industry full of fake smiles, everybody run they mouths when you ain't around they some fuckin clowns

[Hook]
My niggas struggled now we love to hustle, i'm flexin on niggas I might pop a muscle, ahead of my business I feel like im russel

 [Intro]
Ayy, ayy, yuh, yuh, yuh
(Menoh)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

[Bridge]
Ayy, Why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

[Verse 1]
Getting money, I'm gone on a chase
Fuck a ho, I be stacking my cake
I'm no hero, they gave me the cape
First place when I finish the race
In her room and she giving me face
When I nut, she gon' give me my space
You a lame so you cannot relate
Hittin' licks, had to hide from the jakes
Crack the code, then I open the safe
Get my money, then go out the way
Charged up, I feel like triple-A
Think she loyal, I'm fucking your bae
Let 'em talk, I don't care what they say
Niggas pussy, be riding my wave
Ain't my nigga, then get off the stage
Kick that boy in his shit, Johnny Cage
Pom-pom ass nigga
Ol' Uncle Tom ass niggas
Boy, I don't wanna take a picture
All these niggas talking all on Twitter
Talkin' 'bout pulling up with hitters
You a goofy, just look at your image
I'm in the game like a scrimmage
Stack it up, I can't let it diminish

[Chorus]
I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

[Bridge]
Ayy, Why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

[Verse 2]
Ayy, and now you're my enemy
You said you was down to ride
But you're not a friend of me
In the game like a referee
I'm just getting what's meant for me
And they love to hate all the time
But these niggas pressed on me
And they tryna copy the swag
But they cannot get it from me
In the kitchen with recipes
Money long like a centipede
I got up and got it on my own
Be faited with destiny
And I'ma go get all the money
And do this for my family




 [Intro]
Yea
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Aye

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been trippin, I've been going through some bullshit
I don't care if bitches leave me 'cause I always got my music
I remember when they'd judge me, used to say that I was stupid
Now these people say they love me, I just find it as amusement
(aw, yeah)
We can go there
We don't think the same, we don't feel the same
I remember when they used to doubt my name
Sunny days, full of rain
Ain't no shame in my game, Imma bring that pain, knock the beat out with some Novocaine
I just hit a left hook, god why did you do that?
Always been a cool cat, I'm hanging with the Rugrats
My mom on some other shit, she don't seem happy now
I just wanna get this money so I can buy her a house
I don't know what Imma do, I don't know where Imma go
Too much hurt in my chest I feel like I should let y'all know
When it comes down to this, I'm grindin' for my family
At the end of the day nobody's understanding me
Cigarettes and weed always seem like my remedy
When I'm down in my feelings they just always there for me
But I know it's killin' me, but it makes me feel alive
Never been the type of guy to feed into all the lies
I just want a hunnit mill, I just wanna live life
Stressin out like every day, lately shit don't feel right
We could say it's all good, but I know it's all bad
I just wanna speak the truth that's why I'm always in my bag
Used to gettin' no girls, yeah that shit was so funny
Now I got a white girl, she my little snow-bunny
She my Lucky Charm, she would never split that pole on me
All these niggas switched up, went and sold they soul on me
I remember cold days, I remember dark nights
Say I'm movin' too fast, mix that lean with the sprite
Searchin' for some paradise, in the field with my guys
We just tryna make it out, and we ain't comin' for the ties
(for the ties)

[Chorus]
Middle-fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
Middle-fingers in the air, no
Fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air

[Bridge]
I'm just out here grindin' I just wanna make it far
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas cause I know who we are
Mama told me "dream big" so I'm shooting for the stars
Fuck your opinions 'cause I know who we are, who we are, yea

[Verse 2]
Look, I scream "fuck you and your speculation"
My dedication got me shining with no hesitation
I'm nobody yet, but I know it took some patience
Catch me writing music, focus on my education
People bashin' me, people steady harassin' me
I'm tryna be the best and they just wanna see a casualty
No picture perfect nigga, but I know I'm worth it nigga
Thankful for a father figure, he just made me see it clearer
Damn, times change, and my friends too
All this shit I been through make me jump out a window
See the man in the mirror lookin' lost, I'm just tryna live life
Not worried about the cost, to me I'm my own boss
I hope you niggas get the message, I'm just speaking from my heart I'm tired of all the regret
And used to wake up every morning
Get to yawning, get to stretchin'
Now I wake up every morning thanking god for all my blessings

[Chorus]
Middle-fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
Middle-fingers in the air, no
Fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air

[Bridge]
I'm just out here grindin' I just wanna make it far
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas cause I know who we are
Mama told me "dream big" so I'm shooting for the stars
Fuck your opinions 'cause I know who we are, who we are, yea
(yea, yea, yea)

She gave me head like a Medusa
My mom want a house and my bro want a Rari
And I'ma cash out at the jeweler
Ah-what? she wanna go on a date, huh

Oh yeah, it's goin' down

Two hoes going crazy
Niggas actors, Pat Swazey
Sippin' lean, feelin' lazy
If you want a show you gotta pay me
Gold Rollies for the team
Fuckin' hoes, never seen
Keep a shooter with the beam
Straight head, she a fiend
This rap shit too easy
She text my phone like she need me
I cut her off 'cause she greedy
I swear these hoes acting needy
Ayy, she gon' roll my kush nigga
Keep it real with me, why you beat around the bush
I just had to flex on 'em, now they all know who we are
Rockstar lifestyle, she wanna come play my guitar, ooh

[Chorus]
I had to go make a way, ayy

Fuck her, she can't get a date, ayy

 [Intro]
I, I, I, I, I, I

[Chorus]
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart

[Verse 1]
Runnin' bands up with my bros, we be gettin' the dough
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes, keep my head on my goals
We was ridin' down the street makin' plays at the post
I can't even sit and count all the grams that I sold
Young nigga made a way, now they hate that we win
Try to stop me, I ain't cocky, you ain't boxin' me in
I got bitches say they love me and they still got a man
I stay focused, never fold, this shit a part of my plan

[Chorus]
I wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart

[Verse 2]
I made my own wave, I'm with your boo thang
She havin' mood swings, she need a mood ring
A boss, she know I be, so run it up with me
I got the recipe, make you hit melodies
Get high and feel the breeze, I know it's feelin' nice
You wanna live this life because it's feelin' right
And when I'm feelin' down, will you still be around?
Or will you shut me down? Grab the gun and load a round

[Chorus]
I wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start

 [Chorus]
Ayy, I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry

Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm Jon Gotti
I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm Jon Gotti

[Verse]
She a model girl, I put my hands all on her body
I don't do average, girl, she ride me 'cause she feelin' gnarly
I got a Backwood, I be smokin' like I'm Bob Marley
Take a puff, skrrt off fast like I'm in a 'Rari
I be on some shit that people never seen before
He said he down to ride but switched up, that is not your bro
She said she fuck with you but talkin' 'bout you on the low
I'm just sayin' shorty choosin', gotta watch your ho
Takin' chances that they told me that I shouldn't take
Now I sit back and laugh at them 'cause they was full of hate
And time is money, we can't talk if it ain't 'bout the cake
Now you an actor, fake, bitch just get out my face

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm Jon Gotti
I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm Jon Gotti

[Hook]
Count my cash then I dip off
I'm just in my own trance like I'm criss cross
I just fucked a foreign bitch wearing lip gloss
She just wanna be a boss like she Rick Ross
Ima go and get that bag, why they pissed off?

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, shorty you ain't gotta lie to me
Must be doing something right, see all my enemies
I be turnt up on these niggas like I'm Mr. T
All my bitches stay on fleek, they don't need maybelline
Backwoods look like fingers that's that gasoline
You hit it once boy I promise gon' be hard to breath
Bad bitch, fuck me good don't do wedding rings
And that's my baby, you fuck with her then you fuck with me
I hit a lick with my bitch, she with anything
Raf Simons, Rick Owen, she a fashion queen
I don't judge her 'cause i know some things just meant to be
And she drink henny out the bottle, that's a remedy
Purple sprite, baby you know i'm in slow mo
Oh she bounced up on my dick like a pogo
So you know I had to beat it like a bongo
Call me sylvester, in that pussy I go rambo

[Pre-hook]
Outsiders catch the wave, watch out for the tides
Catched a vibe, took some time, now we in the light
Me and my baby chasing money got no time to cry
They be jealous, we don't care, we just [?]

[Hook]
Count my cash then i dip off
I'm just in my own trance like I'm criss cross
I just fucked a foreign bitch wearing lip gloss
She just wanna be a boss like she Rick Ross
Ima go and get that bag, why they pissed off?

[Verse 2]
Ooh, diamonds shining like a chandelier
I ain't ever really worried i don't show no fear
Bad bitch taking trips out the MIA
I think I like her, I don't trust her, I went MIA
All these plays, winning chips, that's that Frito-Lay
And Ima ball, never fall we gon' make a wave
I pull up on a nigga like i got some shit to say
And we like bands, fuck a friend they get in the way
True like religion, see no difference, where my competition
I had to hustle off the muscle just to say i'm livin'
Momma said it's green lights, so its time to get it
Bad decisions, fuck opinions why your boy so vivid
Not with the bullshit, like a nigga name with Scottie Pippen
I cut you off, baby I don't do no reminiscing
Oh you know she gonna have this shit on repeat
I feel like john cena you can't even see me

[Pre-Hook]
Outsiders catch the wave, watch out for the tides
Took some time, caught the vibe, now we in the light
Me and my baby chasing money got no time to cry
They be hating 'cause they see we out here on the rise

[Hook]
I'm just in my own trance like i'm criss cross
I just fucked a foreign bitch wearing lip gloss
She just wanna be a boss like she Rick Ross
Imma go and get that bag, why they pissed off?




 [Intro]
Yeah, I'ma ride or die for the clique
Boy I swear to God that I would die for this shit
That be Maaly Raw

[Chorus]
I'ma ride or die for the clique
Grind with my brothers 'til we make it out the sticks
You a broke nigga, prolly switch up for a bitch
I was in the game, you was sittin' on the bench
Chillin' with my woes like we came up from the 6
I don't fuck with girls that be all up in the mix
Hear he sendin' threats and I ain't even hear the diss
I know I'm the one 'cause I got these niggas pissed
Make the shit look easy, I ain't have to make a wish

[Verse 1]
Ooh, do the dash in the whip
Got a .30 out like Curry, I just aim and I swish
Make her sing like a birdie, she take flights for the dick
Hit her with the long pipe, now she tryna have my kids
Ooh, lil' ho, I'm too legit
Caught up in this fast life, I don't ever wanna quit
You can save the sad stories, I ain't fallin' for that shit
I got diamonds, see me shinin', they all hittin', I don't miss
Ayy, Maaly Raw, we made a hit
Now they see me out in public, run up on me, takin' flicks
Nigga pressed about his shorty, I ain't worried 'bout his bitch
Boy you better get some money 'fore you end up in a ditch

[Verse 2]
Hop in the coupe like oh, yeah
Turn on the radio, yeah
Baby just let me know, yeah
I wanna bank the roll, yeah
I want the guap, the green, yeah
I want the purp, the lean, yeah
She wanna top the team, yeah
That is a thot to me, yeah
I got a Glock, a beam
I live the life you dream
I had to do it myself
'Cause these niggas not for me
These bitches make believe
Play games like hide and seek
I'ma keep bein' myself
'Cause that's how it's meant to be

[Chorus]
I'ma ride or die for the clique
Grind with my brothers 'til we make it out the sticks
You a broke nigga, prolly switch up for a bitch
I was in the game, you was sittin' on the bench
Chillin' with my woes like we came up from the 6
I don't fuck with girls that be all up in the mix
Hear he sendin' threats and I ain't even hear the diss
I know I'm the one 'cause I got these niggas pissed
Make the shit look easy, I ain't have to make a wish

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah I ain't have to make a wish




 Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out the shows
She tell me that she love me, 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people faking and people [?]
You not in my position, I went for this, I was choose

[Verse]
Sacrifices made me the man that I am
If I had to do it, I would go back and do it again
I got money, now they love me, be acting like they my friends
Fuck that shit up, like I'm [?], I'm not letting them people in
Red eyes, layin' [?]
Remember times running from the cops like jump a fence
Now it's not a problem 'cause I made my mama rich
Fuck them niggas hating, we gon' throw em' in the ditch

[Chorus]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out the shows
She tell me that she love me, 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people faking and people [?]
You not in my position, I went for this, I was choose




 [Verse]
Flexing on these nigga, now I think that I'm Hulk Hogan (yeah)
I don't care about you, bitch the money is my motive (yeah)
She just want attention, say it's easy to expose her (yeah)
I'm all in her pussy, you would think I was a Trojan (yeah)
2016 (yeah) I'm coming for the win
And I smoke a lot of weed, I think it is my medicine
If the cops pull me over, Imma hide the evidence
And the way she gave me top, she was so intelligent
I want hella bands, I want hella fans, I smoke hella grams
I'm just on some different shit, she like the way I hit my dance
I just fucked a foreign hoe, got a few out of state
I can never save these thots, I just gotta say my grace
Call my nigga Rahi, said lets go get it poppin (ooh)
I can never switch up, I remember how I got it (ooh)
I just spread the love, all these hating niggas toxic (ooh)
When you on your grind, you can't let nobody stop it (ooh)
Paradise and a pair of Nikes, shawty very nice
Blue berry ice, she the cocky type, she can't stay the night
Diamonds piss yellow, make it rain like the umbrella
(oh) She say she like my sauce, guess I am a jiggy fella (ooh)
Mind state like Kanye, but I'm on another level (ooh)
Niggas want to be alike, like that shit ain't very clever (ooh)
Plug put me on, now my lifestyle is so better (ooh)
Shawty like my voice, it's the type to make her wetter (ooh)
Tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo
Have a closet of designer and a bitch to roll my dope
I don't really need much but my fucking studio
I'm tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo

[Refrain]
And I'm tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo
Have a closet of designer and a bitch to roll my dope
I don't really need much but my fucking studio
I'm tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo




 [Intro]
Ya yuh, aye, these niggas must've thought I was a one hit wonder or something, haha, ay
Aye

[Verse]
She layed on me like a futon
I ain't worried 'bout that bitch I got a new one
Stacking money, smoking gas, what are you on?
Always been a real nigga, you a fool one
All these bitches wanna fuck me 'cause I'm up now
Bought a Sprite, I pour the lean up in my cup now
I was looking back, I got it out the mud, wow
You funny style, boy, you knowing I'm a cash cow
I just wanna get the top, she can't stay the night
I went and bought the Bape, I ain't care about the price
They see we eating, all we got, they cannot take the slice
I learned from my life, I don't ever take advice
I was up with my niggas, steady rolling dice
Why these bitches acting funny?
Tell me, is you in it for the money?
Ain't taking nothing from me
Making sure my brothers never hungry
All about my carrots like a bunny
She want it in her tummy
Mama told me wrap up like a mummy
Smoking Grade-A I'm not no dummy
I just find it funny
Friends always changing over money
2016, I'm that motherfucking nigga you should worry 'bout
I was riding through the 7, bro tote them Mac-11's
He'll squeeze it any second, I'm like, "Oh, yeah"
Tell them niggas back up off me now they see my flow is cold
So I play 'em like it's hockey, they're like, "Oh, no"
Good grades and bad habits
Now my niggas living lavish
Money turned me to a savage
I don't give a fuck
And I need that new Mercedes
They look at me like I'm crazy
But I'm screaming, "Fuck you, pay me"
On my own shit
Yeah I put that shit in motion
Niggas hating 'cause I'm loafing
Better watch how you approach us
I am not the one to play with
Everybody on my dick 'cause I ain't on the same shit
I just had a different vision, y'all be on that lame shit
Shawty fucking with a winner
She just wanna smoke my drugs
I can't take her out for dinner
I just gave her bomb D
Cheeks blow like TNT
If you ain't in my circle, nigga you a enemy
2016 I got a lot of goals
Aye, only 17 with a lot of hoes
Aye, asking who you are, boy nobody knows
Aye, I just kept it real, I can never fold
Nigga




 [Intro]
Ay, I said do you understand me (yeah)

And I was (ay, ay, ay)

[Chorus]

I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

[Verse]
Oh yes going down they see me turning up
Get that bag and lay low I don't know who to trust
I had nothing now for fun I like to run it up
I'm tatted on my face I beat myself don't give a fuck
And I stay down even when them hoes don't show me love
That nigga flexing with no money guess he thought he was
I was driving down the street I had to meet the plug
I'm at the crib smoking pack cuz I don't do the club
Let her roll my Backwood, she want the lavish life
I just bought a pint of lean so lemme grab a sprite
In the cloud with the stars like I'm taking flight
Up all night working hard tryna find the light
Lifes a gamble when its ready gotta roll the dice
Now if I like it imma cop screaming fuck the price
Cops lock my brother up they tryna give him life

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand me
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

[Verse]
Waking up chasing money its a new day
These niggas fake I see right through them like its Blu-ray
And I aint never paid attention to what people say
When you don't have it you gon get it so I made a way
In the field like a quarterback was making plays
Three seconds left I'm shooting I aint fade away
I'm serious about my art you see it in my face
I put my money in my craft now watch me elevate

[Pre-Chorus]
But do you understand me (yeah)
I said do you understand me (no)
I said do you under (ay)
And I don't think they understand me
Imma really go and get a grammy
Imma imma imma do this for my family
And you on me when you know I got a

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand me
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

[Outro]
Nigga why you just pretending
Shawty why you just pretending
All of these people be pretending
And I don't think they understand me
No, no they don't understand me
I said they don't understand me
Like do you under
Do you




 [Verse 1]
Look, niggas hatin' on me I'm just trying to make a way
My bible and my demons make me pray for better days
Dark liquor, cigarettes, and some purple sprite
My life's a gamble, roll the dice, I had to pay the price
Cold hands, foreign bitches doin' slow dance
She a freak but I don't like the way she romance
Poppin' pills, catching chills from these xanny pills
Shawtey say she get a thrill, love the way it feels

[Hook]
Sippin' forties, rollin' doobies, man my life's a movie
I fucked a groupie, got the nudies, handprints on her booty
And niggas say I'm actin' different boy you never knew me
And bitches say I'm actin' different but you never knew me
Sippin' forties, rollin' doobies, man my life's a movie
I fucked a groupie, got the nudies, handprints on her booty
And niggas say I'm actin' different boy you never knew me
And bitches say I'm actin' different but you never knew me (huh)
Let me light another newport, dinner by the food court, ballin' I need two courts (huh)
Let me light another newport, dinner by the food court, ballin' I need two courts (huh)
Cigarettes, and henny bottles (yuh)
Cigarettes, and henny bottles (yuh)
Cigarettes, and henny bottles (woah)
Ciga... woah

[Verse 2]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, menace like I'm Dennis
Lil Skies I'm in it, want green I'm talkin' spinach
See this is the beginning, the story that I'm livin'
I'm makin' bad decisions, still in my mind I'm gifted
I come from Chillenburg, crack needles on the curb
My niggas servin' herb, cops come don't say a word
This is the life I chose, I'm juggin' with my bros
And we don't love these hoes, they all about that dough
And she use me to get high but that ain't catch me by surprise
Used to hide her from my guys 'cause she was always tellin' lies
And the way she rolled a blunt bro she had me mesmerized
Used to look into her eyes and thank God she was mine
Now I'm smokin' good livin' great, took some time to concentrate
Rollin' up, takin' flights, Superman without his cape
Pourin' up, double cups, gettin' rich and buy some bape
Yuh, imma get rich and buy some bape

[Outro]
Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all
Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all
Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all

Gold diggers and a bunch of broke niggas
I took some time to realize I was a born sinner
Now wash my hands before I sit and thank God for dinner
I know my heart is cold but it's shining like some spinnas
I told myself that I would make it if I stopped gettin' faded
Screamin' fuck my education boy I'm on my way to greatness
Victim of the slave ship, work harder for a better payment
Trying to find my placement in a world full of basic

Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all
Until we end




 [Intro - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million

[Hook - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
Getting money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazilian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate cause we the villains of the village

[Verse 1 - Lil Skies]
With my new bitch, she wearing foreign
And she don't fuck with him because he boring
I be in the clouds, bitch I be soaring
Off the ENG then I just pour it
Smoking loud, she just wanna party
She drank too much and now she actin naughty
I let her hit the [?] and now she floating
Her friends fuck with the gang because we [?]
Cooling with some older niggas who gon ride for me
I had to get it by myself and now they copy me
Them snakes maneuver through the grass just like a soccer team
Niggas changing over green, I seen some crazy things
And I'm a young nigga, I got no regrets
I never trust an opp, especially when they tryna flex
I got people hit my phone like I was dropping next
My gang the coldest, bitch we flyer than a fucking jet

[Hook - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
Gettin money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazillian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate cause we the villains of the village

[Verse 2 - Neek]
I'm tryna stack a million, so you never catch me chilling
Don't give a fuck about nobodies opinion
He say, she say shit, but I don't ever hear them
Can't fear them, riding with a bad bitch, she steering
Riding by, these niggas mad you could tell by the way they staring
When it comes to me and these niggas, there ain't even no comparing
Yo gang got the city popping, we got them bitches cheering
Every time I step out I be looking like a billion
I be killing, give a fuck about your feelings
Way these niggas copy you would swear they were our children
These niggas swear they rapping but on the real these niggas squealing
I come from a real small town where everybody is drug dealing
I was taught from a real young age, that street shit ain't appealing
Ever since that day I knew I had to make some millions
There's people out here killing, they stealing for the million

[Hook - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
Gettin money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazillian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate cause we the villains of the village




 [Verse]
I'm swagging out the building, swagger on a hundred trillion
A lot of people talk but Lil Skies be chilling
I'm writing rhymes til my hands ain't got no feeling
I been writing dope flows and now these rappers I'm killing
So I don't plan to stop
You'd rather see me at the bottom but I'm at the top
I always told my bros "Homie one day we'll make it"
But we wanna be legendary so forget famous
I told you dudes I hit this mic just like an uppercut
And half of y'all are fake like Nicki Minaj's butt
I try to keep it real but half of y'all are phony
And I normally spend time writing rhymes but that gets lonely
But man these dudes have no clue what hip-hop is
It's not about the drugs, girls, or the money kid
Dog it's about that realness coming from the heart
See these rappers is all talk but they stink like fart
Illuminati getting trapped inside your brain man
Y'all stand tall but sink fast like it's quicksand
I don't understand where we went wrong dog
But you rappers are wood then I'ma saw off
See homie Lil Skies I probably be that man
To take your Tinkerbell but I ain't no Peter Pan
I'm growing up now so I really understand
That I'ma write real hip-hop and I don't need a hand
I love this music but I don't love the rap game
Cause all of you rappers are talking bout the same things
Nobody cares about the girls and we don't need the chains
We just need a little help where we could make a change
But Lil Skies dog I'm lyrical, people say I'm a miracle
Cause I'm making them spiritual
No need to get technical like I was digital
Physically and mentally eating them like it's cereal
Only time will tell who's the best and that's the deally though, for really though
This is how I do
I am chemically combined to this game like an atom to a molecule
People try and challenge but it's nothing to a boss
When I'm on this mic I'm killing rappers like the Holocaust




 [Intro]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

[Verse 1]
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
19 with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, "Broski you a star"
I said brother hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage
Now I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

[Verse 2]
I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation
I could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated
For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated
Five racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas
Gnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb
Young niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo




 [Intro]
Ayy, ayy
This that shit like
This that shit like where you just talk your shit like... haha
Go 'head O
Ayy, I told them niggas like, look...
Danny, I see you

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, I need 20 for a verse, I need 40 for a show
I got bitches gettin' naked, throwin' money on the floor
Big Patek bust down, pussy hatin' 'cause he broke
I ain't never played the bench, I'm in the game and that's for sure
Claustrophobic, dropped the top, I had to switch lanes (skrrt)
My bitch is crazy, in her purse, she keep a switchblade
I'm out of town, still wear the chain like I'm Johnny Dang
I make it rain in your city, bring the world rage

[Verse 1]
Lifestyle on 300, Sparta's how we comin' (we comin')
Loverboy like I'm McLovin, I got bitches in London
You gon' take a chance and get nothin', niggas fake and be frontin' (they fake)
Whole crowd lit, fist-pumpin', on the stage, I'm jumpin' (jump, jump)
I get cash in abundance, know I made it from my grind
I was waitin' patiently, I knew this shit would take some time
She be sniffin' too much coco, she can't read between the lines
Fell in love with all the hype, now she don't wanna go outside
I bust down the wrist, now my time is full of ice
I bust up my clique, now my niggas livin' life
And you are full of shit if you think I would take advice
You were doin' all the wrong to make sure I was never right

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, I need 20 for a verse, I need 40 for a show
I got bitches gettin' naked, throwin' money on the floor
Big Patek bust down, pussy hatin' 'cause he broke
I ain't never played the bench, I'm in the game and that's for sure
Claustrophobic, dropped the top, I had to switch lanes (skrrt)
My bitch is crazy, in her purse, she keep a switchblade
I'm out of town, still wear the chain like I'm Johnny Dang
I make it rain in your city, bring the world rage

[Verse 2]
Ayy, and I can't be tamed, put this shit on replay (replay)
Run her hand all through my braids, she know I'm the new wave (the wave)
Lately I've been on this chase, dark shades, Blu-Ray (Blu-Ray)
You will never take up my space, I don't care what you say (you say)
I had to run it up
Don't think that you've done enough, I blew up like Mrs. Puff
Now they all wanna fuck with us, and these girls fall in love with us
Like no, no, no, no, no
I gotta let you go, go, go, go, go, for real
