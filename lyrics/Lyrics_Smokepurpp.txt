Leave, then I'm back up in here wildin', baby wipe off your
Nose, what you do with that white girl, the Lord, the only one
Knows, 'cause you claim you don't know her, man, that's how you get
Exposed, actin' like you too concerned, baby, just lose
Control, but not enough control to make the car crash
To the fence, where I'm finna take it
Once I hit it, I touch all the bases
Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey, Mark McGwire with it
Yeah, that boy is frigid
But niggas' hotter than the summer, what you wanna know, yeah yeah

Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the baby, no family
I got the racks that you talk about
Stay in the trap, I'mma break a pot
Rollie water, real deal
Drink, pour up the whole seal
Mama, I made it like Mike Will
Trippin' on lean and two pills
Pull out the choppa, do damage
Ride with the baby, no family

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Hurricane, rollie wrist
Diamonds piss on a bitch
Get the pack off the ship
Racks fatter than a brick
I'm pourin' the tech and it's red
I'm leanin', I can't feel my head
My phone, I can't talk to the feds
The Glock is right under the bed
Stand in the kitcken, I break a pot
I'm geekin' off pills and I'm sippin' wok
Doin' donuts in the parkin' lot
Maserati and its push-to-start
I already fucked on your main
She already fucked on the gang
She takin' pictures of my chain
She takin' pictures in the Range

[Bridge: Smokepurpp]
Rollie water, real deal
Bitch, I'm geekin' off a pill
Got soo many pints, I'm just crackin' a seal

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
(Money soo long, money soo long)
Stain, catchin', money, stretchin'
Dumb, rich, pull up, blessin'
Pull out the choppa, I ride with the llama
So hot Benihana, still pourin' the wok
While I wipe the whole block
I'm juggin' and robbin', got rich off the pot
I'm up, I'm up, got racks, but I'm fuckin' 'em up
These niggas gon' hate, just know that I don't give a fuck
Draw down with the K, I bet that lil boy give it up
She eat it like lunch, she suckin' so long, but I won't bust a nut
My pockets on stuffin', thanksgiving dinner
I go so deep in her, I'm breakin' her bed, hear it crack when I bend her
Lord knows I'm a sinner, bitch I came out a winner
New audi, no roof, it cost me a check

I'm smoking dope, got a cup full of lean
Hit this bitch on the low, like what's up?

Got the guys in the cut, toting guns
Bitch I'm playing with them racks, with them stacks
Bitch I'm playing with the, keys make it back

We gon' pull up to your hood, where you say you from
Got my niggas wildin' out in the trap

[Hook]
Tell that hoe "I don't want you, bitch, we done"

Diamond teeth (shine), diamonds white and pink (it's lit)
Yeah, back in sync, just in time to drink
Still strawberry smooth, still, roll off the blue
Hit her off the view, top floor aerial
Yeah, all she do is dance and take Xans, she too basic
If she ever plan on fall asleep, my hands replace them
Whole damn crew, off the zoot, pour the juice
Hit the jack and count the deads

Walk in the party and the bitches on smack

I got that Glock on my lap
Trappin' in the kitchen with a bitch, whippin' up crack
Whippin' it, till it turn black
Don't need a pound of the gas, needed a pack, (uhh go back)
I'm in the trap, feel like 5 xans
Woke on a xan, shot yo' man
Look at my diamonds, like lightning, they dance
Go to the jeweler, 100k in the van
Look at the diamonds, they wet
They wavy, they splash, they move like the ocean, uh

Documented baller, diamonds on my collar
Caller ID says Lady Gaga
Rose gold Rottweiler when I pop bottles
Jump out the Chevy Tahoe look like Johnny Bravo
Lemon berry locket froze up my esophagus
Now it's noon, I'm moonwalking on my tour bus
Only Wock lean in my white cups
Oreo blunts, double stuffed
Moonlight reflects up off the cobblestone
I got Pirate blood in my chromosomes
Oriental blue on the sapphires
Maroon moon, cranberry vampire
Diamonds dancing like a campfire
Thunderstorm Mercedes, out in Red Rock
I drop my top, smoking Lamborghini leg lock
Green bean diamond look like avocado, sweet pea
Pour a 3 in my Strawberry Kiwi
I 3 wheeled with the Cherokees
Weave through wigwams in the tipis
My pinky ring look like a lego block
Pull up at the Grammys in a helicopter

[Hook: Smokepurpp]
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Fuck one time, then I fuck her sister
Bitch give me neck and I don't even kiss her

Bitch, I'm greedy, I started off humble
Nigga, you can get yo' ass dropped like a sunroof
Feds tryna solve a young nigga like a puzzle
Cause it can go pop and it won't be a bubble
Change my identity, I wouldn't be in trouble
Got the blickies on us, then it wouldn't be a tussle
Big bread on me and it's ready to crumble
Shorties hop out dressed up like plumbers

On her face I spilled my babies
Pop out with them sticks, look like the navy
Lean lean Wok, lean lean wok, sleep like a baby
Wake up every morning, Glock, no safety
Dirty cup, in that bitch yeah that's my baby
Keep that fuck shit from 'round here, I'm bussin' daily

No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety

[Chorus]
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety
No safety, no safety, no safety

Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped a whole show on my new shoes
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped a whole show on my new shoes

Ridin' 'round the block with a freak bitch
Ridin' with the Glock and the tree, bitch
And my hundreds blue but I ain't a Crip
She say she like my sauce and the way I drip

Sippin' on the lean got me fallin', I feel like James Jones the way I'm ballin'
Sippin' on the lean got me fallin', I feel like James Jones the way I'm ballin'
I just want the neck from a freak ho
I don't trust a soul, so I keep a pole

Nigga talkin' down I'ma blow his nose, blow his nose

I don't want friends, I want Audi's

Lil Purpp just came in a Masi
Bust down, just caught me a body
Young Purpp flex like a wrestler
Get the work straight from Mexico
Got a foreign bitch, do a lot of coke
And she countin' money by the peso
Diamond on my neck and it look like glitter
Gucci Gang fuck twin sisters
When I get a check, yeah, they call me mister
Call Mary Kate, wanna fuck her sister
They like, damn, Smokepurpp, how you do that?
You just flow on a track and you kill that
And you thought you had the sauce but you spilled that
Put a hundred in the safe like at Chase Bank
Nigga, run up on me, see my bad side
Got a bad bitch and a backside
All this water on me like I'm baptized
They be switchin' gang, stay on that side
Bitch, I'm Lil Purpp, do a lot of fraud
I be road runnin', crack a lot of cards
Go to Saks Fifth, spend like thirty bands
Walkin' out of Gucci with a Louis bag

Smokin' on a doink, can ya smell that?

Snow, for the crack rock
Snow at the trap spot

Niggas talking on me cause I fucked they hoes
Who you be, don’t know
And your swag is old
Lil Purpp Bless Yo Trap
Lil Purpp Bless Yo Trap
You can have that bitch
I don’t want her back
Lil Purpp Bless Yo Trap
Lil Purpp Bless Yo Trap
You can have that flow
I don’t want that pack

[Outro]
Give me brain like a psychic
Riding round with P90
Bitches thinkin that we ISIS
Hi-Tech bloody cup
I just spiked it
Put these diamonds on my neck
Cause a nigga priceless
