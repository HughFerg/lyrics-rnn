[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)
Going so fast, hope I don't crash (skrr, skrr)
One false move, that could be my last (yeah)
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)
Going so fast, hope I don't crash (skrr, skrr)
One false move, that could be my last (yeah)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I just pulled up in the Benz
It was just me and my mans
Fishbowl, no tint
Scooping your hoe and her friends
Won't take that bitch to the movies
Ain't got no love for the groupies
Seat back while she do me
She get wetter than Jacuzzis
She on go like a green light
She get ran through like a red light
If the head right, then the bread right
Shawty know I be there every night
Rollin', rollin', whip A1 like steak sauce
Zero to sixty, I take off
Can't see me, looking like Ray Charles

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
They tell me slow down, I'm goin' too fast
Young nigga, I just wanna do the dash
I'm so reckless, hope I don't crash
'Cause I'm ballin', like the whip stolen (yeah)

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
All big bankrolls, I got no hoes
I just left my girlfriend, I'm in love with the Ghost now
She's full of emotions and now she's my old bitch
'Cause my 'Rari knows how to ride, when it goes down
And my watch on froze, watch it glow, when the lights out
If it's hot or cold, we gon' still bring the bikes out
I jump out a Rolls-Royce and I hop in a Lamb' now
When I push the button, they like, "What the fuck is that sound?"
Damn, I'm the man now
Only pulled up in this whip, so I could stand out
Bought a icy ring and told 'em it's no handouts
Started up a label, 'bout to make a band now

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)
Going so fast, hope I don't crash (skrr, skrr)

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)
Going so fast, hope I don't crash (skrr, skrr)
One false move, that could be my last (yeah)

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Tryna figure out what you tweaking for
Everything was all good just a week ago
Now you tryna act like I'm creeping though
Told you I had hoes, but you must ain't believed me though
Questions, like why I don't answer my phone
Shawty, you tripping, I'm busy, you always wanna fuck up my zone
Texting me paragraphs and textbooks, girl just leave me alone
You ain't my mom or my PO, ain't got to answer you, I'm grown

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 2]
I been touching hoes the same way that I touch you
Fucking hoes the same way that I fuck you
Treating hoes the same way, but I trust you
I don't love you, but I love you
Do you get it? Do you get it?
This here's something different
What we share is something different
I don't care girl, I'm different
I ain't like these other niggas
I don't care if you was strippin'
Throw it back girl, I'm tippin'
I can't lie girl, I miss it

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Hook]
'Cause I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go

Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Spoken Skit]

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know

[Verse 1]
Who am I to say no?
To all these bad bitches on my timeline
Telling me that they in love
And they always ask me at the right time
When it's night time
Yea its dark out
Sneak, creep out
Yea thats what i'm talkin' 'bout
Naked pictures in my DM's
Wit' a number and a address to they house

[Bridge]
Maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong head
But I remember

[Hook]
Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

[Verse 2]
But don't you act like
You don't miss the old times
And I don't ever control mine
Don't act like you just dont care
Don't you act like
You don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had
All those good old times we shared
Don't you act (Don't you act)
You don't miss me girl
When we see each other
You don't wanna kiss me girl
I done blown up, I done blown up
And you 'sposed to be with me girl
But people grow, times change like the seasons
And right now I need something to believe in
And for those times that you caught a nigga cheating
For what it's worth it wasn't for no reason

[Bridge]
Cause maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong hitta
I remember

[Hook]
Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gone waste no time now that we're all alone
Girl, I'm so glad you're mine and you know

'Cause it ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Loving you isn't easy
The thought about it make me sleepy
I was gone call then I got the wrong impression while thinking
Maybe I'm bugging, am I tweakin'?
Now that I'm on, it's gon' be a long time 'till they reach me
I left 'em hanging just for reaching
Picture going hard for somebody then they end up leaving
That mean you did it for no reason
Baby I'ma cuff you if I want to, fuck a season
If I cut you off, I swear you won't stop bleeding
I'll treat you how you want, show me how you want to be treated
If I touch you there I bet you won't stop leakin'

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gon' waste no time now that we're all alone

You make all these hoes nervous
Get it all 'cause you deserve it

Girl that pussy get so wet, be like a rain storm

It's so easy now
Women multiplying off my clout
To tell the truth, though, I had hoes when I was sleepin' on the couch
That's the sauce, that's the sauce
Always had it, always will
To the ones who got my real number, let me keep it real
Pour out my exes, I pour up some new ones
Please do not take pictures, you doing too much
Fuck talking, I keep it short like a crew cut
I can't fuck you if you let the whole crew fuck

In your hand all day, on the 'gram all day
You been tweetin', Snapchattin'
And I feel like I just got to ask you
Do you notice me?

If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Yeah, yeah
Halloween

Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to somethin', they just not just bluffin'
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo!
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo!
I hit that Ginobili with my left hand up like woo!
Lobster and Céline for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, french fries for them hoes that wanna diss
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
Uh, uh, uh, I think I need some Robitussin
Way too many questions, you must think I trust ya
You searchin' for answers, I do not know nothin', woo!
I see 'em tweakin', they know somethin's comin', woo!
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin', woo!
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, fuck was you expectin', woo!
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Michael Jordan just had text me, woo!

[Verse 2: Future]

I just seen the jet take off, they up to somethin'
Them boys just not bluffin', them boys just not bluffin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
She was tryna join the team, I told her wait
Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates
Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu
I just threw a private dinner in L.A.
Trappin' is a hobby, that's the way for me
Money comin' fast, we never gettin' sleep
I, I just had to buy another safe
Bentley Spurs and Phantom, Jordan fadeaway

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, Jumpman, Jumpman, I don't need no introduction
Jumpman, Jumpman, Metro Boomin on production, wow!
Hundred cousins out in Memphis, they so country, wow!
Tell her stay the night, valet your car, come fuck me now
Jumpman, Jumpman, live on TNT, I'm flexin', woo!
Jumpman, Jumpman, they gave me my own collection, woo!
Jump when I say jump, girl, can you take direction? Woo!
Mutombo with the bitches, you keep gettin' rejected, woo!

[Verse 4: Future]
Heard they came through Magic City on a Monday
Heard they had the club wild, it was star-studded
A bunch of girls goin' wild when your chain flooded
And I had 'em like wow, cup dirty
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Money on the counter, choppers on the floor
I just copped that tempo, DJ Mustard, woo!
Way too much codeine and Adderall
We just count up big racks, whoa!
I know I'ma get my bitch back, whoa!
I count all these racks that I have on me now
I'ma have you like whoa
Chanel N°9, Chanel N°5, well you got 'em both

Them boys up to somethin', they just not just bluffin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'



[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang
See, he did come back though)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Whats up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup?
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'mma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah
Golf Wang

Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'

Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous

Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC 10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

Dress it up and make it real for me, hahaha
Whatever that fuckin' means
808 Mafia

[Chorus: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse 1: Future]
Dirty muddy in a cup
The .45 by my gut
My young nigga in the cut
Taking you out for some Jordans
Let's count this money, no rushin'
I'm on a one way, flushin'
Loud pack smellin' musty
These fuckin' police can't touch me
These bogus police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me (Freeband Gang)
Apply the pressure with the VVS'
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (skrrt)
Lift it up and gon' and offset it
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry
Future Hendrix, Dirty Sprite, legendary (Dirty Sprite)

[Chorus: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse 2: Future]
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gon' wake up and smoke us a blunt and fuck
She gon' keep it so real with a nigga that
I'ma come back and always gon' fuck with her
Bend the curve in a Spur like a MARTA bus
I was workin' and servin' in Nautica
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury
Fuck around, teach you that recipe
Fuck around, you gon' be out of here
Make her say huh like a nigga was Juve
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Take the tool inside the club
And just in case a nigga ever gotta use it
Get a pint of code' an pour it up, nigga

[Chorus: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Bridge: Future]
These bogus police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me
Apply the pressure with the VVS'
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Lift it up and gon' and offset it
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry
Future Hendrix, Dirty Sprite, legendary

[Chorus: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie

I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average
Even though she average

[Intro]
I don't wanna hear at that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' to cameras like "What you need?" and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 2: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we’re paying back dues
Where were you? When all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary ain’t gon’ pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain’t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I’m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I’ll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 3: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don’t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I’m here today cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion



[Intro: Future]
I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Drake]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

Talking to your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time, we been

[Pre-Chorus: Future with Drake]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason

Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want 'em
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

But that nigga can't save your soul, nah
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Ungrateful, ungrateful
Your momma be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful
I'm too good for you, too good for you
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful

High Klassified な音楽
I got the truth in me, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I take (still comin')
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 3: Future]
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't never answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(so familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong

[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance

Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance

Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it
No sleepin' in the streets!
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Part 2]

[Beat Switch]

[Chorus]
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
Yeah, and you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

[Outro: Popcaan & Drake]
...Shell out, all if yuh eye nuh big
Always haffi look out, yuh no know if yuh head book out
Dun know, a de Unruly boss, dis man

And if a boy nuh like OVO or Chromatic
Yuh can jus suck yuh mada!!
With no apology, if you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO Unruly
(Machine gun shots)
With my woes



[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring—dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do



[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Outro]
Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up



[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Bitch, I'm drownin'
Bitch, I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
Drownin'
I'm drownin'



[Intro]
Now I'm saying, "What's good with you"
I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only thirteen when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Hook]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

[Hook]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me

But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs

But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up

You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'

You lied I should’ve knew better

[Hook]

Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me

Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

[Verse 2]

Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a ménage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it

Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm

In the club love to make it rain

[Intro]
Bitch, I'm really timeless

[Verse 1]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Hook]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you," I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more
We switch the flow up, if you a busta I'ma cut you off
Bitch I'm goin' up
Gettin' money, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, hold up it get ugly
I'm a fuckin boss, hah
Good now but I started off
Just a young nigga runnin' 'round and the butter soft
Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless



[Intro]

Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now

Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And I know she know wassup, baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist

[Verse 2]
They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section, fill it up when my cup empty

All about my F, can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me, it get ugly
If I wasn't gettin' money would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke would you start actin' funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song, she say "This is my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist

They not loyal, they happy they looking down on you

Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no i don't trust bitches

[Verse 2]
What the fuck im supposed to fall in love with you?

But when you fucked up, nigga they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her

I love money I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don’t fuck… wit ya
So why you fuck wit us?
I believed in you, should've told me you had a seed in you
This whole time you was frontin' and I ain't see it in you
Now I'm thinkin' what was you doin' when I ain't sleep with you
Now your tooth brush is my new Jordan cleaner
I know who the Ten is, you not Serena
You was supposed to be my dream girl, two-seater
For me and you in a Beemer
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Now you showed me not to trust bitches
Fuck bitches, just hit it, never run wit it
Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch you did it
Really thought that i was losin' it, now I’m losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosing
I don’t know how I go through wit it, I go through wit it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches. Fuck bitches, Fuck bitches
My nigga we don’t fuck… wit ya
So why you fuck wit us
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches



[Intro]
(Ness on the beat)
I'm not a regular person

[Verse 1]
Done with the perkys
I don’t even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don’t even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I’m still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain’t never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin’ and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won’t nobody tell you what happened
I’m good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I’m speeding
Nigga you wouldn’t believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I’m living everything I was dreaming
I’m killing, I feel like I’m cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can’t nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything

[Hook]
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
My nigga it’s just us now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain’t no pounds or “what’s ups” now
Pretty bitches hit me up now

[Verse 2]
I got on Saint Laurent, come here baby
I just wanted some company baby
I don’t want you to feel like I’m playing
Can I fuck you without you complaining?
Got no time for a lunch with you baby
I get bread, what the fuck is you saying?
I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations
I can't stop, I put on for this
Swear to god I put on for this
Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this
I can brag cause I’m confident
I’m the man, ain’t no stopping it
I don’t got to wait for a shopping list
I want to body a fit then I'm copping it

[Hook]
I fuck it up, fuck it up now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Ain’t no pounds or “what’s ups” now
My nigga it's just us now
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person



[Intro]
Wasn't I good to you?
Cardo got wings

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, "How to make a milli'" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a key
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, "Bring the studio to everywhere we go" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you



[Intro]
Another one, it's another one
And another one
Huh?

[Hook]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone

[Verse 1]
Two doors, black on black whip
Told that bitch that I'm from New York, she like my accent
Every time I get a new jawn, she the baddest
All these zippers on my Balmain, I feel like Jackson
Every time she give me good head, I give her backshots
Man that pussy so good, I don't wanna back out
So I gotta strap up, just to blow her back out
When she know I'm 'bout to nut, she don't tell me back out
She put her ass out
That's what happened before I passed out
She really got me in my bag now
She got me in my bag now
Huh?

[Hook]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone
Huh?

[Verse 2]
I laughed with her, smoked gas with her
When I showed her I can rap, she said, "You a bad nigga"
I said, "What about your man?" She said, "Fuck that nigga"
You must have been doin' bad with her
She said she only let me hit to get you mad
Oh, it's so sad, nigga
Takin' niggas bitches back to back, yeah I'm that nigga
A-Boogie on her titty, took my autograph with her
Whoever she goin' home to, I feel bad for that nigga
He gon' be a mad nigga
He won't even wanna talk about it
When we started fuckin' she promised we never talk about it
Bitches be for everybody, nigga why you trippin' 'bout it
Fuck a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
He a bitch about it
Yeah he a bitch about it it
Fucked a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
Yeah he a bitch about it

[Outro]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Ah! Another one

Pullin' up and they be in they feelings
It was all good when we was in the Civic
Sick jewels make your bitch choose
They all stare when the wrist move
And it all came from that raw cane
In the kitchen with the wrist moves
Give a fuck about your rap deal
I could show you how the cash feel
Run it up until the bags fill
Safe spot, keep stash sealed
Money money, I don't sleep without it
Couple hundreds, I don't leave without it
All my niggas got to keep it solid
Then if not then I don't want to be around it
Now my bitch bad, got a C around it
I just took my neck and put a key around it
Money piling, I can't see around it
So the pocket rockets, got to keep around it
We couldn't just settle, my foot on the pedal
I come in Hell's Kitchen and cook with the devil
I'm good in the ghetto, for real nigga
I be in the trenches with the night riders
And the pack pushers and the white buyers
I'm like Mike Myers with a knife by him
I could bring it to you but the price higher
Bust down, make the ice brighter
We ain't really on sight typers
We the serve you on sight type of
Give it to you in a white Viper

Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo

Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like—

You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (rain) pourin' (pourin')
All my cars is foreign (foreign)
All my broads is foreign (foreign)
Money tall like Jordan

Ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
First niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock, Rollies that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose, I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Hook: JAY-Z and (Kanye West)]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me

[Verse 2: Kanye West and (JAY-Z)]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all."
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it Jay?
(Ball so hard)
What she order, fish fillet?
(Ball so hard)
"Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard)
Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I’m in France, ahah, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
‘Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my dealer? What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
‘Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude: Blades of Glory sample]
“I don't even know what that means
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not, it's gross (Gets the people going)”

(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it; how you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone (I’m definitely in my zone)
(zone zone zone zone...)

[Verse: Kanye West & Kelly Price]
Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt

She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'

You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...

[Verse 1: Kanye West & The-Dream]
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace

Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, Natalie Is Great & Choir]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
(B-I-G, oh God! Go)
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me, like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, she tryin' to get me that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin' with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin' villain
Man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
That's killing everything that he see for the dough

Yeah, I'm talkin' Ye, yeah, I'm talkin' Rih
Yeah, I'm talkin' B, nigga, I'm talkin' me
Yeah, I'm talkin' bossy, I ain't talkin' Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talkin' LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told—who he gonna tell?

It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green, it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin' with the clique

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Outro: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique

I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?"
Whatever I want to do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One & Brenda Lee]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, & Brenda Lee]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Uh-huh, honey

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual

Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more

And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for

Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)

Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big when we pull up give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mix this pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don’t follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these o's I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said "Where we goin'?" I said "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (Someone said)

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Big Hawk, & Swae Lee]
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl—playin' for keeps

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, it's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week (alright, alright, alright)
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe
Yeah, this right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

[Chorus: Gunna]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shells for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when they end with a S

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Couple of angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm

[Chorus: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes (flawless baguettes)
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (yeah!)
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag and get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shells for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when they end with a S

[Outro: NAV]
La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CC's you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking where the codeine at
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet



[Intro]
(Harmonizing)

[Hook]
I try it if it feels right
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets brighter, the night gets nighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Harmonizing)

[Verse]
We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'
I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose

[Hook]
I try it if it feels right (ohh)
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets brighter, the night gets nighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Harmonizing)

[Bridge]
Shit, I try it if it feels nice
Shit, this kinda feels nice
Mm-mhm, mhm, ay
Miles and miles away

[Outro]
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you gettin' ready to
Take the night away
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you’re gettin' ready to
Chase the night away (ooo)

Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet pap-er
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' door

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions!"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

Project Baby, y'all was skipping in the hallway, I was skipping school
On my Ps and Qs,  on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleeding concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you, so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissing on nobody B, I'm vibing on the beat
Honestly, I'm just trying to be, I just gotta be
Trying to get over on anything, they telling lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't getting on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli

Yeah, that money's what I play for, call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Milds with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You getting skinny, I'm getting chunky, getting money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds, hundreds

Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked
You would think I'm 'bout to smack your bitch, I made her hit her knees
Met this plug, I was talking 'bout he put that thing on me
I finessed him, ain't got time to let you run no game on me
Like i'm working out, life done dropped a lot of weight on me
I've been busy, I've been working hard so don't you hate on me
You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
Don't you switch, don't you change on me, no switching lanes on me
I was in that Jag, now I'm pulling up in that Range on me
I ain't in no gang, but if you run up I'm gon' bang homie (kodak let it spray)

[Hook]
Girl I'm done with you
Girl we done it's through (girl we done)
I hit that nigga for the work (I finessed his ass)
Stick and move, then I SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT (Ooh I'm gone)
What is up with you (what is up with you?)
I thought I said I'm done with you (I though I said it's over)
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher too (I will fuck you over)
Sniper on the roof, he playing peek-a-boo (he will knock you over)
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT (I SKRT, SKRT)
Jump in that Jag, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
(Ooh Kodak, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT)
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, Kodak
Glee

[Chorus]
Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, hoe
Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Beamer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?
She know a nigga be stuntin' like a Power Ranger

[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 2]
These ain't Ray-Bans, these Saint Laurent shades, hoe
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

[Hook]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up

[Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas, man
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Bridge]
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zircon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (yeah)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming)



[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I just pulled up in the Benz
It was just me and my mans
Fishbowl, no tint
Scooping your hoe and her friends
Won't take that bitch to the movies
Ain't got no love for the groupies
Seat back while she do me
She get wetter than Jacuzzis
She on go like a green light
She get ran through like a red light
If the head right, then the bread right
Shawty know I be there every night
Rollin', rollin', whip A1 like steak sauce
Zero to sixty, I take off
Can't see me, looking like Ray Charles

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
They tell me slow down, I'm goin' too fast
Young nigga, I just wanna do the dash

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
All big bankrolls, I got no hoes
I just left my girlfriend, I'm in love with the Ghost now
She's full of emotions and now she's my old bitch
'Cause my 'Rari knows how to ride, when it goes down
And my watch on froze, watch it glow, when the lights out
If it's hot or cold, we gon' still bring the bikes out
I jump out a Rolls-Royce and I hop in a Lamb' now
When I push the button, they like, "What the fuck is that sound?"
Damn, I'm the man now
Only pulled up in this whip, so I could stand out
Bought a icy ring and told 'em it's no handouts
Started up a label, 'bout to make a band now

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind

Ten bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock, them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard, then your money start expandin'
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Savage, bitch, but no I'm not Randy
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a Plan B
And I'm sippin' on that Codeine, not Brandy

[Hook: 21 Savage]

I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch

Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me

[Verse 1: 21 Savage + Future]
Flexin' on that bitch, hold up
Bought a necklace on that bitch, hold up

Hold up, hold up, bitch I like to ball
Hold up, hold up, without no weave, you bald

[Hook]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma "at" your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one
Savage I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

[Hook]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?

They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Numb the pain with the money and I ride 'round with that Tommy
And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"

That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song
It goes like

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 1]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
Oh get over it

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 2]
I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no,no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)

[Outro: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]

My crown won't fit on your bum-ass lace fronts (uh)
You bitches catchin' a fade, shout out my nigga Lil Boosie
All of your friends'll be dead, you can get hit with that Uzi
I call him Ricky, he say he love me like Lucy
Get you a straw nigga, you know this pussy is juicy
This Givenchy is custom made, now you can't get it at Saks though
I don't work in no office, but they copyin' and that's facts though
I ain't tryna be violent, but if Nicki on it, it slaps, ho
Get you lined for that paper like a loose leaf when that strap blow
I'm with a couple bad bitches that'll rip the party
If Quavo the QB, I'm Nick Lombardi
Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty
I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti
"Ayo Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?"
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti
It's a wrap, like the things on the head of a Saudi
Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty

[Verse 5: Takeoff]
Brand new Chanels (Chanels)
I scuffed 'em runnin' from 12 (12)
Ain't make no commitment with none of you bitches
'Cause money is treatin' me well (uh uh)
If Nicki should show me her titty
Right hand on the Bible, I swear I won't tell (swear)
If I get to play with that kitty
I wonder how many platinums we gon' sell (albums)
Pop a Perc and catch a feel (I pop one)
Now I cannot feel the wheel (woah)
My chest bad, give me chills
And the left hand on Richard Mille (ice)
Not the watch, but the price on the ice
If you don't know what that is (huh)

Abort the mission, that's a kill (pew, pew, brrr)

[Chorus: Quavo]

Pull up, woo, woo, jumpin' out the court (jump)
Cotton candy (drink), my cup tastes like the fair (cotton)
Straight up there (where?), we didn't take the stairs (where?)
Faced my fears (fears), gave my mama tears (mama)
Shiftin' gears (shift), on the Nawf, get serious (serious)

[Outro: Quavo]

I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga
Don't ask for my take on it (don't ask for my opinion!)
Speakin' in lingo, man, this for my nigga

This for my niggas that call up Fernando
To move a piano (brr, brr, brr!)
Fuck all your feelin' ‘cause business is business

Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace (Versace!)
Word to New York ‘cause the Dyckman and Heights girls

Fishbowl, no tint
Scooping your hoe and her friends
Won't take that bitch to the movies
Ain't got no love for the groupies
Seat back while she do me
She get wetter than Jacuzzis
She on go like a green light
She get ran through like a red light
If the head right, then the bread right
Shawty know I be there every night
Rollin', rollin', whip A1 like steak sauce
Zero to sixty, I take off
Can't see me, looking like Ray Charles

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
They tell me slow down, I'm goin' too fast

All big bankrolls, I got no hoes
I just left my girlfriend, I'm in love with the Ghost now
She's full of emotions and now she's my old bitch
'Cause my 'Rari knows how to ride, when it goes down
And my watch on froze, watch it glow, when the lights out
If it's hot or cold, we gon' still bring the bikes out
I jump out a Rolls-Royce and I hop in a Lamb' now
When I push the button, they like, "What the fuck is that sound?"
Damn, I'm the man now
Only pulled up in this whip, so I could stand out
Bought a icy ring and told 'em it's no handouts
Started up a label, 'bout to make a band now

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Tryna figure out what you tweaking for
Everything was all good just a week ago
Now you tryna act like I'm creeping though
Told you I had hoes, but you must ain't believed me though
Questions, like why I don't answer my phone
Shawty, you tripping, I'm busy, you always wanna fuck up my zone
Texting me paragraphs and textbooks, girl just leave me alone
You ain't my mom or my PO, ain't got to answer you, I'm grown

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know

And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 2]
I been touching hoes the same way that I touch you
Fucking hoes the same way that I fuck you
Treating hoes the same way, but I trust you
I don't love you, but I love you
Do you get it? Do you get it?
This here's something different
What we share is something different
I don't care girl, I'm different
I ain't like these other niggas
I don't care if you was strippin'
Throw it back girl, I'm tippin'
I can't lie girl, I miss it

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Verse 1]
Who am I to say no?
To all these bad bitches on my timeline
Telling me that they in love
And they always ask me at the right time
When it's night time
Yea its dark out
Sneak, creep out
Yea thats what i'm talkin' 'bout
Naked pictures in my DM's
Wit' a number and a address to they house

[Bridge]
Maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong head
But I remember

[Hook]
Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

[Verse 2]
But don't you act like
You don't miss the old times
And I don't ever control mine
Don't act like you just dont care
Don't you act like
You don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had
All those good old times we shared
Don't you act (Don't you act)
You don't miss me girl
When we see each other
You don't wanna kiss me girl
I done blown up, I done blown up
And you 'sposed to be with me girl
But people grow, times change like the seasons
And right now I need something to believe in
And for those times that you caught a nigga cheating
For what it's worth it wasn't for no reason

[Bridge]
Cause maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause i'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong hitta
I remember

[Hook]
Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Loving you isn't easy
The thought about it make me sleepy
I was gone call then I got the wrong impression while thinking
Maybe I'm bugging, am I tweakin'?
Now that I'm on, it's gon' be a long time 'till they reach me
I left 'em hanging just for reaching
Picture going hard for somebody then they end up leaving
That mean you did it for no reason
Baby I'ma cuff you if I want to, fuck a season
If I cut you off, I swear you won't stop bleeding
I'll treat you how you want, show me how you want to be treated
If I touch you there I bet you won't stop leakin'

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gon' waste no time now that we're all alone
Girl, I'm so glad you're mine and you know
That I'ma treat your body right from head to toe
Cause it ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
It ain't nothing like lovin' you

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
You, you, you, you got me
I ain't gon' lie, you poppin
Anything you want, you can have it
Girl, you know that shit is automatic
Swerving, swerving
Girl, I swear you're so perfect
You make all these hoes nervous
Get it all 'cause you deserve it

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Yeah, I might put you on
Be my main jawn
Beat that thang down
Yeah, you love it when I fuck you with my chains on
Girl that pussy get so wet, be like a rain storm
Yeah, when I, when I skrr skrr
Yeah, I know you wanna ride when I skrr skrr
It don't matter where I'm at, you could be far from me
I'll be there in a minute if you callin' me, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Shawty, you been on my mind for so long
That I ain't gon' waste no time now that we're all alone
Girl, I'm so glad you're mine and you know

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, twenty women gettin' added to my roster everyday
Some from Texas, some from Cali, some do not live in the states
I'm ashamed, no I'm not
Who am I kidding, man I love it
24 with like 24 reasons to say "Fuck it"
It's so easy now
Women multiplying off my clout
To tell the truth, though, I had hoes when I was sleepin' on the couch
That's the sauce, that's the sauce
Always had it, always will
To the ones who got my real number, let me keep it real
Pour out my exes, I pour up some new ones
Please do not take pictures, you doing too much
Fuck talking, I keep it short like a crew cut
I can't fuck you if you let the whole crew fuck
It's been too long, I've been fucking you since I was tryin' to get on
And now you got a husband, now you got kids
They don't gotta know, fuck thinkin' 'bout this, yeah

[Chorus: PnB Rock]

Them boys just not bluffin', them boys just not bluffin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
She was tryna join the team, I told her wait
Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates
Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu
I just threw a private dinner in L.A.
Trappin' is a hobby, that's the way for me
Money comin' fast, we never gettin' sleep
I, I just had to buy another safe
Bentley Spurs and Phantom, Jordan fadeaway

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, Jumpman, Jumpman, I don't need no introduction
Jumpman, Jumpman, Metro Boomin on production, wow!
Hundred cousins out in Memphis, they so country, wow!

A bunch of girls goin' wild when your chain flooded
And I had 'em like wow, cup dirty
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Money on the counter, choppers on the floor
I just copped that tempo, DJ Mustard, woo!
Way too much codeine and Adderall

[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang
See, he did come back though)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Whats up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup?
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'mma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah
Golf Wang

Porsches in the valet, I got Bentleys, I got 'Raris
Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'
Bitch, I got the juice and the carbine
Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty
Runnin' with the wave, get you killed quick
Shoot you in your back like you Ricky
Lil Mexico, from no life to afterlife

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC 10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

[Chorus: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse 1: Future]
Dirty muddy in a cup
The .45 by my gut
My young nigga in the cut
Taking you out for some Jordans
Let's count this money, no rushin'
I'm on a one way, flushin'
Loud pack smellin' musty
These fuckin' police can't touch me
These bogus police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me (Freeband Gang)
Apply the pressure with the VVS'
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (skrrt)
Lift it up and gon' and offset it
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry
Future Hendrix, Dirty Sprite, legendary (Dirty Sprite)

[Verse 2: Future]
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gon' wake up and smoke us a blunt and fuck
She gon' keep it so real with a nigga that
I'ma come back and always gon' fuck with her
Bend the curve in a Spur like a MARTA bus
I was workin' and servin' in Nautica
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury
Fuck around, teach you that recipe
Fuck around, you gon' be out of here
Make her say huh like a nigga was Juve
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Take the tool inside the club
And just in case a nigga ever gotta use it
Get a pint of code' an pour it up, nigga

[Chorus: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)

[Intro]
I don't wanna hear at that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' to cameras like "What you need?" and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 2: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we’re paying back dues
Where were you? When all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary ain’t gon’ pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain’t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I’m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I’ll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 3: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don’t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I’m here today cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Drake]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

Talking to your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time, we been

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want 'em
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

You doing me dirty

But that nigga can't save your soul, nah
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Ungrateful, ungrateful
Your momma be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful
I'm too good for you, too good for you
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful

I got the truth in me, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I take (still comin')
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 3: Future]
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't never answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(so familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Outro: The Weeknd & Future]
Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss
Kindness
Down, like a nigga, she lie
Kindness, she lie
Kindness, oh

[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

And that's why I need a one dance

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Part 2]

You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here

I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
Yeah, and you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes

[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring—dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got

Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do



[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Outro]

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up



[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Bitch, I'm drownin'
Bitch, I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
Drownin'
I'm drownin'

Now I'm saying, "What's good with you"
I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only thirteen when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Hook]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

[Hook]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"

Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you

Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 3]
But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'
I shoulda known better
You lied I should’ve knew better

[Hook]
But still I'm saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Outro]
Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?"

Everything was always understood with you
Even bust a couple juugs with you

I look back and I laughed when I noticed it
I still think about you, you, you, you

(Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?")
I still think about you
I look back and I dab when I noticed it

[Verse 1]
Yeah I started in the back, had to skip the line though

That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me Rondo, now that nigga John Doe

[Pre-Hook]

Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

[Verse 2]

Making bitches go retarded with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a ménage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic?
It go dumb like a drum, hear the beat blastin'
When it come to that fire, I'm a fucking dragon

[Hook]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do

Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm

In the club love to make it rain
Like what nigga, we don't fuck withcha

Ever since I was a young nigga coming up nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas

[Intro]
Bitch, I'm really timeless

[Verse 1]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Hook]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you," I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go

Bitch I'm goin' up

Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off

Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this

I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless

[Verse 1]
Brought the MAC out, niggas sat down

Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now

A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And I know she know wassup, baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist

[Verse 2]
They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section, fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F, can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me, it get ugly
If I wasn't gettin' money would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke would you start actin' funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song, she say "This is my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist

Bitch, I should've never even fucked with you
Trust issues, that shit made me feel uncomfortable

I love money I don't love bitches

[Hook]
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no I don't trust bitches

Fuck bitches, D.T.B, no i don't trust bitches

[Verse 2]
What the fuck im supposed to fall in love with you?

But when you fucked up, nigga they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her

[Verse]
I love money I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don’t fuck… wit ya
So why you fuck wit us?
I believed in you, should've told me you had a seed in you
This whole time you was frontin' and I ain't see it in you
Now I'm thinkin' what was you doin' when I ain't sleep with you
Now your tooth brush is my new Jordan cleaner
I know who the Ten is, you not Serena
You was supposed to be my dream girl, two-seater
For me and you in a Beemer
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Now you showed me not to trust bitches
Fuck bitches, just hit it, never run wit it
Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch you did it
Really thought that i was losin' it, now I’m losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosing
I don’t know how I go through wit it, I go through wit it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches. Fuck bitches, Fuck bitches
My nigga we don’t fuck… wit ya
So why you fuck wit us
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches



[Intro]
(Ness on the beat)
I'm not a regular person

[Verse 1]
Done with the perkys
I don’t even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don’t even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I’m still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain’t never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin’ and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won’t nobody tell you what happened
I’m good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I’m speeding
Nigga you wouldn’t believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I’m living everything I was dreaming
I’m killing, I feel like I’m cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can’t nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything

[Hook]
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
My nigga it’s just us now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain’t no pounds or “what’s ups” now
Pretty bitches hit me up now

[Verse 2]
I got on Saint Laurent, come here baby
I just wanted some company baby
I don’t want you to feel like I’m playing
Can I fuck you without you complaining?
Got no time for a lunch with you baby
I get bread, what the fuck is you saying?
I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations
I can't stop, I put on for this
Swear to god I put on for this
Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this
I can brag cause I’m confident
I’m the man, ain’t no stopping it
I don’t got to wait for a shopping list
I want to body a fit then I'm copping it

[Hook]
I fuck it up, fuck it up now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Ain’t no pounds or “what’s ups” now
My nigga it's just us now
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person



[Intro]
Wasn't I good to you?
Cardo got wings

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, "How to make a milli'" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a key
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, "Bring the studio to everywhere we go" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you



[Intro]
Another one, it's another one
And another one
Huh?

[Hook]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone

[Verse 1]
Two doors, black on black whip
Told that bitch that I'm from New York, she like my accent
Every time I get a new jawn, she the baddest
All these zippers on my Balmain, I feel like Jackson
Every time she give me good head, I give her backshots
Man that pussy so good, I don't wanna back out
So I gotta strap up, just to blow her back out
When she know I'm 'bout to nut, she don't tell me back out
She put her ass out
That's what happened before I passed out
She really got me in my bag now
She got me in my bag now
Huh?

[Hook]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some

After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone
Huh?

[Verse 2]
I laughed with her, smoked gas with her
When I showed her I can rap, she said, "You a bad nigga"
I said, "What about your man?" She said, "Fuck that nigga"
You must have been doin' bad with her
She said she only let me hit to get you mad
Oh, it's so sad, nigga
Takin' niggas bitches back to back, yeah I'm that nigga
A-Boogie on her titty, took my autograph with her
Whoever she goin' home to, I feel bad for that nigga
He gon' be a mad nigga
He won't even wanna talk about it
When we started fuckin' she promised we never talk about it
Bitches be for everybody, nigga why you trippin' 'bout it
Fuck a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
He a bitch about it
Yeah he a bitch about it it
Fucked a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
Yeah he a bitch about it

[Outro]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone

Dreamt about it, then we went and did it

Pullin' up and they be in they feelings
It was all good when we was in the Civic
Sick jewels make your bitch choose
They all stare when the wrist move
And it all came from that raw cane
In the kitchen with the wrist moves
Give a fuck about your rap deal
I could show you how the cash feel
Run it up until the bags fill
Safe spot, keep stash sealed
Money money, I don't sleep without it
Couple hundreds, I don't leave without it
All my niggas got to keep it solid
Then if not then I don't want to be around it
Now my bitch bad, got a C around it
I just took my neck and put a key around it
Money piling, I can't see around it
So the pocket rockets, got to keep around it
We couldn't just settle, my foot on the pedal
I come in Hell's Kitchen and cook with the devil
I'm good in the ghetto, for real nigga
I be in the trenches with the night riders
And the pack pushers and the white buyers
I'm like Mike Myers with a knife by him
I could bring it to you but the price higher
Bust down, make the ice brighter
We ain't really on sight typers
We the serve you on sight type of
Give it to you in a white Viper

He said-

[Pre-Estribillo: Anuel AA]
Mi diablita (-blita)
Ella se pone pornográfica en la intimidad (baby)
Y su marido no la valora y la deja sola (la deja sola)
Y yo siempre la estoy esperando con mi pistola (-tola)
Y conmigo ella siempre se moja

[Estribillo: Anuel AA & 6ix9ine]
Bebesita (uah)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (bebé)
Porque tú ere' una diabla dentro de una mujer (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Y cuando se esconde el sol tú quiere' beber, hija 'e Lucifer

Bebesita (mi baby; uah, uah)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (¿por qué-é-é?)
Porque tú ere' una diabla dentro de una mujer (muje-e-r)

¿Pa' qué? ¿pa' qué? ¿pa' qué?
¿Pa' qué vas a serle fiel?
¿Pa' qué? ¿pa' qué? ¿pa' qué?
Baby, olvídate de él
Tú ere' mi diablita y yo soy tu demonio
Un amor de manicomio
Y si te veo con él, yo te odio
Siempre me tiene' en insomnio

[Verso 2: Anuel AA]
Medusa, Versace (Versace)
Siempre hacemo' la 69 como Tekashi (yeh-eh)
Y yo te rompo to' en secreto, Illuminati (-nati)
Y ella se baja conmigo en la disco en el Ferrari (-rrari)
Fumando Mari' (uah)
Y tú te hiciste tu cuerpo, bebé, en R.D
Y chingamos y siempre nos venimos a la vez
Te hice el amor y en tu piel me enredé
Y mi bicho en tu totito te tatué
Oh-oh-oh (uah)
Bebé, tú eres mía, ese hombre olvídalo-o-o
Y rebota esas nalgas bailándome reggaetó-ó-ón

[Estribillo: Anuel AA, 6ix9ine]
Bebesita (uah)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (yeh-eh)

“We're going to skate to one song, one song only”
Ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
First niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock, Rollies that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose, I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Verse 2: Kanye West and (JAY-Z)]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all."
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it Jay?
(Ball so hard)
What she order, fish fillet?
(Ball so hard)
"Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard)
Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I’m in France, ahah, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
‘Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my dealer? What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
‘Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude: Blades of Glory sample]
“I don't even know what that means
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not, it's gross (Gets the people going)”

You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling

You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone (I’m definitely in my zone)
(zone zone zone zone...)

Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe

[Verse: Kanye West & Kelly Price]
Now, if I fuck this model

She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you some'n
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...
I wanna wake up with you in my...

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi, Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir & Kelly Price]
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Chorus: Kanye West & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands



[Intro: Samoria Green & Natalie Green]
(Yes, God)
We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord)
We want the lord (Yes, Jesus)
And that's it (Yes, God)
Hallej- hand over Satan (Yes, Jesus)
Jesus praise the Lord (Yes, God)
Hallelujah, God (Yes, God)
We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West & The-Dream]
I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Verse 1: Kanye West & The-Dream]
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
That's why we need you now, oh
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is a God dream

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything (Thing, thing, thing)

[Refrain: The-Dream & Choir]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, Natalie Is Great & Choir]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, ‘cause I want some

[Big Sean]
B-I-G, who fuckin' with me?
Oh, God! Okay

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
(B-I-G, oh God! Go)
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me, like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, she tryin' to get me that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin' with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin' villain
Man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
That's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique

(Click clack, stick 'em up!)
Yeah, I'm talkin' Ye, yeah, I'm talkin' Rih
Yeah, I'm talkin' B, nigga, I'm talkin' me
Yeah, I'm talkin' bossy, I ain't talkin' Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talkin' LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told—who he gonna tell?
We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green, it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin' with the clique

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Outro: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the
Go!



[Intro: Bon Iver]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?"
Whatever I want to do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Bound to fall in love

Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One & Brenda Lee]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, & Brenda Lee]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)

Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine

Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual

Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more

And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for

Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said "Where we goin'?" I said "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (Someone said)

Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, it's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week (alright, alright, alright)
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe
Yeah, this right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

Pull up on the scene, yah (yah)
Sip my tea, lean no Hennessy (yah)

[Chorus: Gunna]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shells for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when they end with a S

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Couple of angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm

[Chorus: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes (flawless baguettes)
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (yeah!)
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag and get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shells for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when they end with a S

[Outro: NAV]
La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CC's you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking where the codeine at
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet



[Intro]
(Harmonizing)

[Hook]
I try it if it feels right
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets brighter, the night gets nighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Harmonizing)

[Verse]
We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'
I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose

[Hook]
I try it if it feels right (ohh)
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets brighter, the night gets nighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Harmonizing)

[Bridge]
Shit, I try it if it feels nice
Shit, this kinda feels nice
Mm-mhm, mhm, ay
Miles and miles away

[Outro]
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you gettin' ready to
Take the night away
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you’re gettin' ready to
Chase the night away (ooo)

Glee
Southside
Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions!"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions!"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet pap-er
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions!"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' door

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions!"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission

Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass
I got Prada on my hoe ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the pole at, where your clothes at?
I ain't talking 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all tripping, too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skipping in the hallway, I was skipping school
On my Ps and Qs,  on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleeding concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you, so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissing on nobody B, I'm vibing on the beat
Honestly, I'm just trying to be, I just gotta be
Trying to get over on anything, they telling lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't getting on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you falling off your feet
I will trick your ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play for, call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Milds with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You getting skinny, I'm getting chunky, getting money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds, hundreds

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
I ain't gon' do the nigga shit 'cause I’m too good for features, huh

Last time I wifed a bitch she told the world I beat her, huh
And when they locked lil' Kodak up, my nigga I couldn’t believe it, huh
Ayy, lil' shawty, pop my whoadie
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking yuh
Hit her from the back, damn that bitch bleeding

Instead of looking over my shoulder, huh
Forces with a nigga, no Yoda, huh
That mean a young nigga got woo on me (Ayy)

When I say keep the poker, I ain't talking 'bout no beans
Project Baby, you know I got baby bottles full of lean
I've been through so much of shit, this shit'll' make a nigga sing
I remember rocking bugle boy, now rock designer jeans
God dang, you just like my chain, you just like to swing
It's 1k, I got 22k and all my niggas bling
Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked
You would think I'm 'bout to smack your bitch, I made her hit her knees
Met this plug, I was talking 'bout he put that thing on me
I finessed him, ain't got time to let you run no game on me
Like i'm working out, life done dropped a lot of weight on me
I've been busy, I've been working hard so don't you hate on me
You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
Don't you switch, don't you change on me, no switching lanes on me
I was in that Jag, now I'm pulling up in that Range on me
I ain't in no gang, but if you run up I'm gon' bang homie (kodak let it spray)

[Chorus]
Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, hoe
Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Beamer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?
She know a nigga be stuntin' like a Power Ranger

[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?

[Verse 2]
These ain't Ray-Bans, these Saint Laurent shades, hoe
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

[Hook]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Bridge]
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zircon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (yeah)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming)



[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I just pulled up in the Benz
It was just me and my mans
Fishbowl, no tint
Scooping your hoe and her friends
Won't take that bitch to the movies
Ain't got no love for the groupies
Seat back while she do me
She get wetter than Jacuzzis
She on go like a green light
She get ran through like a red light
If the head right, then the bread right
Shawty know I be there every night
Rollin', rollin', whip A1 like steak sauce
Zero to sixty, I take off
Can't see me, looking like Ray Charles

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
They tell me slow down, I'm goin' too fast

All big bankrolls, I got no hoes
I just left my girlfriend, I'm in love with the Ghost now
She's full of emotions and now she's my old bitch
'Cause my 'Rari knows how to ride, when it goes down
And my watch on froze, watch it glow, when the lights out
If it's hot or cold, we gon' still bring the bikes out
I jump out a Rolls-Royce and I hop in a Lamb' now
When I push the button, they like, "What the fuck is that sound?"
Damn, I'm the man now
Only pulled up in this whip, so I could stand out
Bought a icy ring and told 'em it's no handouts
Started up a label, 'bout to make a band now

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast

[Hook]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard

I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma "at" your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one
Savage I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

[Hook]

They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

[Hook]

Can't fake love, I just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare

Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin'
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain’t on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up
Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no pictures, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot

Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah

My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song
It goes like

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 1]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
Oh get over it

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 2]
I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather

Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)

Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

Took her to the room, in other words, kept that private (kept that private)
She was my heartbreak, I told her keep those violets (ooh, ooh)

Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Then you're left in the dust unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh), you don't make it easy, no (No, no)

'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I can feel the weight of what you say (ooh, ooh)
I had explanations for days (ooh, ooh)
Don't think you're the only one that's sane
It seems like we're not on the same page
All I do is think when I'm away (when I'm away)
Colors burst and all I see are shapes (hey!)
Sun goes away and that's when I call your name (your name)
She's here for good, and I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
She said the E was for missin' my embrace (yeah, oh-oh)
So yeah, I feel so out of place (woo, oh yeah)
I was meant to love and protect you
You know what's on my mind, but not what's in my heart
Give me someone to connect to (to)
Because these drinks are hitting me a little hard

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)

And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels

[Verse]
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel
You're still a bad girl after all these years
Yo, didn't I give you the NyQuil?
So you're on home base and I'ma steal
I picked you up, your chest like the Man of Steel
I might just save that girl like the Man of Steel
I might just pull up on stainless steel
Don't gotta question, 'cause I know she will
Only someone involved can stay the night until (ooh)
But I think we both know how it feels (ooh, yeah)
This morning when we took shots and cheered
You just realized that you had somethin' real (ooh)
But I'm the one that don't know how to deal
I'ma a-a-always seal the deal
I'ma womp, womp, womp then seal the deal
With them diamonds that you can see from here
If they aren't A-list, just leave 'em there
'Cause you'll be hearing about us everywhere
When the squad roll up, they couldn't help but stare
Ayy, I'ma just sit that there
She got a ass, she gon' just sit it right there
I like a bad bitch when she long hair, no care
I won't ever go on no cab
I said, "You wanna take a shot?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Other niggas over there disrespect, yeah
I say, "You tryna be down?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Off the drink, baby, I'm a wreck, yeah
In the backseat, when I get the neck, yeah
Got me runnin' to you for some sex, yeah
But for one night, don't know how to feel
About a heartbreak story in Encino Hills

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel



[Intro]
What's in these drinks I spilled?
Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this
Drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out

[Chorus]
What's in this cup for real? (For real?)
What's in this cup for real? (for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
Was this chick for real? (For real?) Was this bitch for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? (For real?)
What's in your heart, for real? (For real?) (for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? (Is in your heart for real?)
What's in your heart, for real? (Is in your heart for real)
(what's in your)

[Verse]
I'm gonna pass this time I wouldn't want you to find (find)
I left the house last night 'cause there was too many vibes (too many vibes)
Drivin' me while she wild, I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come be near (wanna come near)
Drivin' me while I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come near (come near)
But my eyes criss and cross and I'm already gone and it's not hard to see (to see)
Plus that over-the-counter was put to good use, yeah, that's just what I did
I could tell she ready when she came up out her shirt and she laid up on me
Do what you feel and I feel what you say and I see what you mean

[Chorus]
What's in this cup for real? What's in this cup for real?
Was this chick for real? Was this bitch for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)

[Bridge]
I already told you, you already froze up, I am really frozen
I already told you, I already rolled up
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)

[Outro]
What's in these drinks I spilled? Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this, drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out
What's in these drinks I spilled? Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this, drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out



[Verse 1]
Winter's over, let the sun in
Wife-beater on me, let's pour the rum
Wife-beater on me, I'll take you on
I'm the closest and you're shinin' like a summer solstice
Everyone's tryna figure you out
On the patio and we're just strung out
And I know what you're into
Fortune tellers couldn't tell you what to do
If I seem like I'm bad news

[Chorus]
Then hide from me, girl
I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria
I'm fuckin' takin' you serious
Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl)
In love, no typical love
I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run

[Verse 2]
Tan Jeep out front with the Rollie on
Nine deep and we've been away from home too long
I'ma make your bitch choose
Five liters in the cooler
Five liters in the cooler
You can pose with your poodle
Drive fast in your new car
Drive fast in your new car
I'ma give you that bling
Kiss the big face that I love dearly
That nigga ain't near as cool as me
Hate with all your might, I'm coolin', b
And I'm sure you've never had this experience before
Helicopter on the roof, let's soar
And I'm out on the west like Schwartz
Niggas fuckin' up the golf course
So that's what rich niggas are doin' these days
Yeah we get money like 10, 12 ways
And on a restless night
She gon' take me where I need to go
In the backseat of the Maybach, where we used to get on
And you want real love
One that'll make you feel like you just woke up

[Chorus]
I think you better hide from me, girl
I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria
I'm fuckin' takin' you serious
Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl)
In love, no typical love
I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run

[Verse]
I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I've been broken, heart's contentious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave

[Chorus]
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty—
I know you so well

I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear

And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot

[Intro]
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the sun don't shine
The tears don't show, won't hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I hate myself, but
It won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer,  now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's
Word of a pacifist to war of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to Eden, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"

Part I

[Intro: Kris Wu]
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, oh it's a vibe
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, vibe

[Verse 1: Kris Wu]
When I jump into the temple (when I)
Prefer a local mental
Bending knees and wishing place inside to hide low, go
Took a beer I need a 这个beat让你倒地
能力超出你底线
帮助你觉醒
或是打听你的一字一句
都已经到期
都是我玩具
都对我赞许
所以才会把你领地占据
Yeah, like I'm running the game (game)
Don't you fuck with my fame
Light it up, spark it up, burn it into flames
I'm the one and only motherfucker from the East
All them bitches lining up to feel me, spit it then I peace
Gettin' in my zone (gettin')
I do this shit alone (I do)
I'm the Yeezus of the East
You need to Watch the Throne (yeah)

[Chorus: Kris Wu]
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I’ll be on your labels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'
When you peep me, I’m at the top
Ayy, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'
I ain’t never, ever doubt what I’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I be fallin' but they see me flyin'

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah, tell your chick I like her, take it on my Leica
And I'm always stacking paper, but my name ain't Michael
Got a crib in Indo, it's tall just like the Eiffel
I could get her number if I put it on my rider (yuh)
God damn legit, told me that she liked my fit
When I take her out to dinner, man, the check ain't gettin' split
Don't look like I'm getting thinner with the chickens and the ribs
Man, your bitch is what I say
One day, I saw her and got the kiss
Don’t say my name, I never wanna breathe your air
Coke and Kool-Aid, there’s just some shit you don’t compare
I got a x-ray and I just saw my old girl there
She was my ex babe, but now I really just don’t care
I'm so tired, but my mind is racin'
Fuck with me and see what kinda problems you'll be facin'
Friday 13th, I make you look like you met Jason
Like a damn femur poppin', just what I’ve been cravin'

[Chorus: Kris Wu]
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I’ll be on your levels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'
When you peep me, I’m at the top
Ayy, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'
I ain’t never, ever doubt what I’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I be fallin' but they see me flyin'

Purple body like a Saint
Ooh, big body coupe just like a tank

I'm just tryna fucking ease the pain
‘Fore I blow my mind like Kurt Cobain
No I won't change

Yeah, and I promise I won't change
And I promise I'm the same
Trippie Redd, you know my name
Bitch, they say that I'm insane
I might blow your fucking brain
Bitch, I'm fly just like a crane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
And that bitch got angel wings
And just spitting all these flames
And it just 'nnihilate the lames
And it annihilate the lames

[Chorus: Joji]
They said that I won't make it
They said that I won't change

Now they say why you changin'
Yeah, they ask why you've changed

Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit

[Verse 2]
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane at that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want – fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

[Chorus]
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah
Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah

[Verse 3]
They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead



[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you

Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow
Yeah, that's good

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry—I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

[Bridge: Both]
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight

[Verse 3: Pharrell (Tyler)]
C'mon baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look. I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Wolf and Salem]
"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"



[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Anytime I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
(Uh, switch it up)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like a alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yeugh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?



[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets
On my waist, there's a black Glock
New girl moved on the block
She been plottin' on my brown cock
Last night I slept over hers
During sex, I overheard
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn
From Adventurin' Time

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

[Bridge 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
He's at your window

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous



[Intro]
Swag, 2011
Young Nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 2]
So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet
(No homo. Too soon.)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 3]
Wait a God damn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Outro]
Cut it out! I said I didn’t want no goddamn lettuce. I don’t want that shit! I don’t want your goddamn lettuce. He-he



[Intro]
"I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!"

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

[Sam]
Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?



[Intro]
Yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

[Verse 2]
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them

[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport, go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses, take this shit to school

[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught, go to sleep

[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal play this shit in church

[Verse 7]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I’m bad for you kids to listen to
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?



[Intro: Tallulah]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? (Umm)
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigga
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I'm calling your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned

[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48", motherfucka I'm great
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike tire
Never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now!"

[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch Suck Dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

[Hook 2: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na na na na na na na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na na na na na na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
Can't agree? Bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
Shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a squeaky sound, the shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing like...

[Outro]
[Wolf:]
Oh, shit, aw fuck
[Clancy:]
What the fuck!
[Wolf:]
Aw, I'm sorry
[Clancy:]
Is that my shirt?
[Wolf:]
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
[Clancy:]
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!



[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone



Part I: 911

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me)
(Call me) How you doin'?
(Call me) My name is Lonely, nice to meet you
Here's my number
You can reach me, woo!

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me)
911, call me some time
(You should call me)
911, call me some time
911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Anna of the North]
Call me
911, call me some time
You should call me
911, call me some time
911, (you should call me, oh)
911, (you should call me)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

Part II: Mr. Lonely

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!

Tay-K & BlocBoy JB — «Hard»

Раз, два, три, Baby варит dope
Пять, шесть, семь сук на мне, они все hoe
Pull up — это ghost, Lil Jon — Get Low
Tappy курит пон, и мой gas э-рон-дон-дон
Носки под сандали, да, я posted up на трэпе
Еду-еду-еду с glock'ом — это human traffic
Парень, ты не трэпер, ты даже не рэпер
Dimebag тебя скурит, просто сунет в rolling paper
Я рано проснулся, просто трэпил по утру
Да, я трахал твою boo, потому что я могу
Ябба-дабба-ду, я бы трахнул Лободу
Lil Tape bless yo trap и Benzo shooters coming through
Я миксую лин, Xanny и Syrup
Нахуй мусоров, это Москва, а не Chiraq
Pull up на твой block, я танцую Diddy bop
Ты много пиздишь, по-любэ поймаешь shot
Шатаут Любэ, калаши на мне
Залетаю в клуб и все hoe сказали: «Уэ»
Залетаю в бендо, кирпичи сказали: «Йа»
Fast Food Music, блять, Benzo Gang, гррра

Madvillain — «Accordion»

Е, окей, йе, е, а
Hold up, у микрофона rainman
Не трогай майк, это святое дело амен
Джи, мне нужен пастор, бэндо паранормален
Приходил Хесус, оттуда вышел GG Allin
Я играю с рифмой чаще, чем сука на снэпчат
Та же сука пишет, но Тэйпу не нужен читчэт
Oh shit, rhyme gun издаст клик-клэк
Я так давно в рэпе, что помню что такое снэпбэк
Стэпбэк, ведь в толпе нету врача
Я въебал игру и сделал лямчик с горяча
Cash rules everything around me
Tape get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all
Хэй, эй, dollar dollar bill y'all
Хэй, е, Benzo Gang, хоу
Е, хэй, Baby Tape в этой суке, е
Fast Food Music, bitch

Каспийский Груз — «Табор Уходит В Небо»

Молодой ублюдок
Мое блюдо — твоя сука
На мне тысяча патронов
И в моем бэге базука, ну-ка
Бейби Тейп, Бейби Тейп, Бейби Тейп
Это Брахма, или это Будда?
Поджигаю прах, эта урна с BackWood'а
Тема Deep Shit, когда [?] - это пудра
После пару зэнов я в дзене — это мудро
Бошки дымятся
Для Crips'ов и для Bloods'ов
Я не рад стараться для вас
Не доебаться до нас
И еще раз, и ещё много-много-много-много раз
Я передал OG напас
Боря, wassup?
Fast Food, nigga, non-stop
Я показал им два, но отдал десять
У меня есть бэг и он очень много весит
Хуй мусорам
But I get you some
У меня есть план

First day back up on the block, it's still murder on the opps

When you see me in the street, my nigga you don't know me
It's my first day out, it's my first day out
You ain't beefin' 'bout no money then that shit is played out
I got the bald fade now, I can cop all J's now
Man I came a long way from the halfway house
Back on the block, twenty-three Glocks
Watching for cops, I got gas in my sock
The way that I'm flexing, you'd think I'm The Rock
I load up my weapon and aim at your top
Teach a nigga lessons with the Smith & Wesson
I send them bullets at you like a message
I do not love 'em, I work 'em like peasants
I'm at your house like I'm Santa with presents
Laid in a Phantom
I stitch it up like a nut to a hammer
I move that white, call it Hannah Montana
Come in your house with them purple bandanas
Bet you can't handle
Make that boy strip like a dancer
Kidnap your mama for ransom
Your bitch she love me, I'm handsome
Thirties on forty, turn him to a phantom

[Chorus]
BlocBoy be the next to blow, I serve you gas like Texaco
We don't smoke no Reginald, you can't beef with a vegetable

You shining, that's how I spotted you
Them diamonds I gotta get off you
That's a closed casket, put him in a basket
Headliner, it's breaking news

[Verse]
Smoking on dope, chilling with the guys
While you at work pullin' five to nines
I'd rather go pull me a crime
Or hit the club throwin' up signs
Nigga diss crip then he dying
I got two white hoes snorting up lines
But I don't do dope drugs
But I'ma fuck on both of 'em
Stack my hundreds, nigga no ones
I don't really fuck with no one
Super Saiyan on these niggas
I might turn into a Gohan
Got my hand on the trigger
Nigga playin', shoot both of 'em
Nigga playin', shoot both of 'em
Nigga playin', shoot both of 'em
Shoot a fire with both arms
What is you sayin'?
Can't make demand, we used to do store runs
And your daddy is a bitch
'Cause he got his ass kicked by Grandpa Joe's son
Young nigga you a ho's son
And you gon' have a ho's son
And it's really fucked up
When y'all getting locked up, y'all can't make no bond

[Chorus]
Who is you talkin' to, turn into barbecue
Keep talking shit, I'ma spark at you
Lie to my face like you getting cake
Pussy boy, show me a dollar fool
You shining, that's how I spotted you
Them diamonds I gotta get off you
That's a closed casket, put him in a basket
Headliner, it's breaking news

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & (Meek Mill)]
Yo, he was the realest, I was the baddest, we was the illest
When he approached me, I said, "Yo what the deal is?"
In and out them dealers, rockin' chinchillas
I got him in the back of that 'bach, I think he catchin' feelings
Now it's all eyes on us, and this all lies on trust
And if them bitches wanna trip, tell 'em they tour guide's on us
This kitty cat on reclusive, he duck, duckin' them gooses
I put him on to that new new, now he only fuck with exclusives
He was like (What's your name?) My name Nick
(Where you from?) New York in this bitch
(Choose and pick) You got the right one
All them hoes, ain't nothin' like them

[Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do."
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm a artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without a album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari – hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented?
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin'
We young niggas, we mobbin', like Batman and we're robbin'
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block, bike on twelve o'clock
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo friends turn in yo enemies
And when there’s beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich, love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' about that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move in to Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man
Woo! We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echos from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

[Outro: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Intro]
I just wanna know how niggas going to jail
Telling on niggas, coming back home and it still being cool
I just wanna know how a nigga on Instagram and Twitter with fifty thousand followers
Ain’t got no money in real life, but still popping, I just wanna know
I wanna know, if a nigga ain’t really putting it in, but acting like he putting it in
Niggas still letting it fly like it’s cool, I really wanna know man
This shit getting different out here it’s getting spooky

[Verse 1: Meek Mill + Quentin Miller]
Now when that shit went down with Chris, you wrote a check
In New Orleans wore my chain to get respect (you a fraud)
So what that tell me? You a pussy and a fed
Say the wrong shit you know the shooters at your neck
I just wanna know, if you ain’t write that running through the six shit
Tell us who the fuck was Quentin running through the six with?
"Running through the six with my woes
Counting money, you know how it goes
All the real live forever, baby
And the fake get exposed"
Niggas writing for you cause you know you never did shit
When I threw that hook out, I was tryin' to catch a big fish
We the type of niggas to tie your mother up
Fuck your sister in the ass and hit your brother up, pussy
You really sweet, I call you buttercup
You fucking dork you changed the style because you studied us
Coming with the same flow
Switching up your lingo
We just want a refund, this ain’t what we paid for
Every time that we come, we get what we came for
Spitting another niggas shit, but you claim you king though?

[Hook]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
How these niggas acting like they trill but really fake
And people acting like it go
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Was it Quentin Miller? Was it Hush or was it Detail where you really got your flow?
(Milli Vanilli that nigga)

[Verse 2]
Money make a fake ass nigga look real again
Money make a sucker that told look trill again
Says a lot about all the people that's feeling him
But I'ma show you bitch ass niggas what's real again
Heard that other nigga talking we ain’t get back yet
Let’s keep it short, nigga you ain’t get your chick back yet
And now she rocking with the chaser and now you missed that check
You went from Clear Port to boarding pass you miss that jet, hold up

[Interlude 1: Sample]
"Cat, I got to take them off of here—that's right—I got to take them off of here, there’s only one, and that’s me, you understand?
'Fore all that fighting, you understand? Sucka thinks he good—sucka thinks he can whoop me, And I know he can’t whoop me and I—Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand, let me get mines first. Then after I get mine, y’all can do what you wanna do."

[Verse 3]
You know you fucked up right?
You shoulda just said nothing
Now you're going to have to give me a check to stop
All I hear is platinum that platinum this
Meanwhile I’m on the carpet with a platinum chick
I got a platinum rollie, platinum whip
Niggas frauds I told the truth, don’t ask me shit
All this industry fake enemy and rap shit
It’s never really my style we got cash to get
I really started from nothing now it’s back to shit
Puffy almost caught a domestic when he smacked that bitch
Hold up, let that bitch breathe

[Interlude 2: Diddy]
"Yeah, this is called poppin' shit. There’s no cut on it. There’s no cut on it. If your feelings get hurt, you feel like, "Oh, that’s an arrogant little comment—" no, this is the truth and the truth hurts. Haven’t I paid my dues? Haven't I weathered the storm? Didn’t I weather the storm? Niggas is gone and I'm here."

[Outro]
You let Tip homie piss on you in a movie theater nigga, we ain’t forget
Real niggas back in style this shit is lit
This that Ja Rule shit and 50 Cent



[Intro: Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God

All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)

Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'mma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and Jeremih]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You ready? You ready?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips

With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
And a nigga fuck around get the R.I.C.O Act
Shoot shoot, and one, where my free throw at?
And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats
Like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They know Meek Milly, I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money I'm getting my nigga
I swear I don't know what to do with it
Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers
I really don't give a fuck who with 'em
Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time
And ya'll forgot about me
Acting like I don't really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling, let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill & Big Sean]
Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B.X
Skinny nigga but I do it large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong, umm he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the p-jects
Or probably catchin' mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
Cause we next and we flex like
90PX, working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me... I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S. bitch you know it's B.S. boy I run my city
End of story, nigga P.S
All white Maybach, Green Bay they packing
Y'all niggas was slackin' 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say life's a game of chess you can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all big rappers
I say yeah nigga I murder that Panamera turtle back
Niggas say they want beef, well where the fuck is my burger at?

That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that Cujo

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk what they gon' say (gon' say)

Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn
Let that shit burn I'mma let that shit burn let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Bitch, I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it

D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra
Burn bitch, I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn shit (swerve, swerve)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit
Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga, you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit

Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit different day I ain't broke no more it's a different day
Don't turn me down I got shit to say my purp strong like it's lifting weights

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk what they gon' say (gon' say)

[Intro]
Sound M.O.B

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woo!
I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a bullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A "QM," that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop "6," fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again

All of my niggas is way up
These niggas is haters, I know that they haters (Suckers)
I score your bitch like a layup (Score)
I make a mil' like a layup (More)
I pop a pill just to stay up (Woo)
I sip the lean just to slow it up (Slow it up)
I'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)
All of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Like the coca when we mix the soda up (Whip it)
Perfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)
Fuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)
Shorty fuckin' for Chanel!
I ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)
Push the 'Rari 'til the motor bust
Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper
I be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred
They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money
And fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)
I bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money
I act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad
They don't wanna see the Wraith
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
‘Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him

Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi the way I'm flyin' round
And I don't fuck with no niggas

[Intro: Solange (Sampled)]
You and me will always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you start acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get with ya
Told me I could never get with ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
I was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby
You name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things
My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
And I'm not proud and always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right with ya
You always picked me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
And I'm not proud and always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

Te juro que lo vi corriendo, wacho, y quiero que corra de nuevo
El barrio lo sabe, lo vieron running tres cuadras del ghetto
Sigo esperando ese tiro, digo, me lo prometieron

Y quiero money, dinero, para mamá el mundo entero
En el hood me las cogí a todas, debo cambiar de hemisferio

Muchas putas quieren pipa pero nunca compran nada
¿Por qué? Loca, viniste a comer

Crack that seal and take a whiff and I come back alive (die)
Niggas commit suicide when they don't got mob ties
Flip it like it's Five Guys, I'm 2Pac, get all eyes (all)
Look at the bitch, she a dime
So many watches, a nigga can't run out of time
They get out of line
The gang in your yard with the strap like the Uber driver with the sign (brrt)

[Intro]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows—
—out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved



[Chorus: J. Cole]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (uh-huh), got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd; totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'...

[Refrain: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Bridge: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me 20 dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game, like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but...

[Refrain: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Bridge: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Got me up all night (all night), all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (all night), constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (all night), down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (all night), drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (uh-huh), got me open all night, hey

Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it
If she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before"—knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby"—knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth—I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher—please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool—sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause…"

[Hook]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no



[Hook: TLC]
Even though I
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked – look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (this crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail, wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, I'm well now
If you askin' will I tell now – ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' because man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (that crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Intro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Hook]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

[Hook]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

[Outro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Intro]
Hollywood Cole, go
Ay Hollywood, ay Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done went Hollywood

[Verse 1]
You wanna know just where I'm at, well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "Man that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

[Pre-Hook]
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Hook]
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, woah
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick woah

[Verse 2]
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
(This is the part that the thugs skip)
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through (The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singing

[Pre-Hook]
To the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Bridge]
Get off my dick

Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Sing this song yeah, song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah

[Verse 3]
(The make up) This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho



[Intro]
Love yours
Love yours
No such thing

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Bridge]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived

[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved



[Produced by Vinylz]

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

Bang that other side, nigga curb

37 cameras for the sneakers

And beat 'em, they ain't my people

Don't do no talkin', when you see him, you better shoot in his face
I got a hundred bitches that can't wait to replace
Michael Jackson, nigga, Thugger Jackson moon walkin'
The S.L.I.M.E. army tool shoppin'

No I can't get arrested 'cause I'm talkin' 'bout my necklace

Bicking back, being bool like a uncle

Betting on me like I'm Vegas
Stick to the code man, there won't be no trace
Thugga Thugga, tell me what would you say?

No J Money, but my gun say, "Bow"
Pop a molly, look at her then fiend

Sandwiches, you know you in between
And you gotta know we at the green
You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yo, now

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'
Like, fuck it, we ballin'
Now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling
I'm chilling, just living
I'm burning away
Conversations we having
I'm getting too static
Too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

[Hook: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browsers
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

[Hook: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m in, gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it
But, baby, it’s gon be alright, ha, alright



[Intro]
Some people, oh, whoa, oh-oh...
Yeah, people say, people, oh-oh, say...

[Verse 1]
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking 'bout her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What do I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry

[Verse 2]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shooting stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry



[Part I]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Mhm, mhm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & J.I.D]
Yeah, well, climbing over that wall, mm (Yeah, wall, wall)
I remember, yes I remember, yes I remember it all
Swear the height be too tall (Yeah), so like September I fall
(Down, down, down) Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
It's feeling like you hot enough to melt, yeah
Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself, yeah
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah

[Bridge: Mac Miller & J.I.D]
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere (Yeah)
Self care, I'm treatin' me right, yeah
Hell yeah, we gonna be alright (We gon' be alright)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out

[Interlude: Devonté Hynes]
Been on the road, I don't see it
Out on the road, I don't see where I'm going

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & J.I.D]
Yeah, I been reading them signs (Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I been losin' my, I been losin' my, I been losin' my mind, yeah (Yeah)
Get the fuck out the way ('Kay), must be this high to play ('Kay)
It must be nice up above the lights
And what a lovely life that I made, yeah (Uh)
I know that feelin' like it's in my family tree, yeah (Wow)
That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'
Somebody save me from myself, yeah

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, we gonna be good
Hell yeah, they lettin' me go

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home with my eyes closed
But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out

[Part II]

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know, hey
Well, didn't know what I was missing, now I see a lil' different
I was, thinking too much, got stuck in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling
Plus I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling, in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay I ride around my city when I come home, yeah
The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah
My disconnect and upload
Watch it spin around, we just spinnin' round, yeah
Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah
We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love so
Tell me are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safer there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oohhh
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling, in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah



[Intro]
Hey! Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man is kinda high over here

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest motherfucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public
And you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Hook]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take them to the pad, it's a wrap

[Verse 2]
And motherfuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

[Refrain]
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Hook]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take them to the pad, it's a wrap

I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sipping
Groupies fall in love, I'm like bitch you must be tripping

Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck and nothing 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't make a difference if you crying in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'mma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more, play a number one spot on the Billboard

[Bridge]
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup

[Verse 2]
I'mma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine

When I went to every high school class would be
Tryna fuck the female faculty

I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah I got raps, tryna talk shit what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I'mma lay low chill, 'til I let that stack

[Bridge]

Keep me high, drugs is close

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no ($ign)
Aye—

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay your legs like a store they open up
And you got people in line
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
The type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a rebel, go a second and a third time
Left you up a verse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate  yah third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music, started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sake I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

[Hook: Ty Dolla Sign]
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home

Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS

Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Hey now, I'm saying
My only way out is the way in
I won't stop 'til you're mine, no way
Well, all my days now, they changin'
I got angels, no more Satan
Looks like God's on my side, this time
Well, I been meanin' to tell ya
You lookin' better every day, write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
If it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain, yeah
Ooh Cinderella, don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been taking all day
Wherever you came from, wherever you going
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah
So don't you dare throw this away
I been meanin' to tell ya
You look better every day, write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
And if it's forever or never it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain



[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Think I can see a fucking halo, about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano, some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches
He got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the Republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick!
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

[Chorus: Action Bronson & Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam
Don't hold your hand out for nothing
If you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them chips, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma
My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy
‘Cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game
Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

[Chorus: Action Bronson & Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement, now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka
Leather to the foot, horses, I lead 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks
I hold the multi-colored flavored gat – blat!

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

[Outro: Loaded Lux]
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealing trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You who I'm finna murder, this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you, Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were strucking blows, bloody nose for your honey rolls
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever with them Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps – who the fuck is Mac Miller?



[Intro: Mac Miller]
Close your eyes...

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Iman Omari]
So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women
And suspicion got me lookin' at you different
How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just (downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that, but (now I'm aware)
When you a youngin
You just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gonna show you what the love is...

[Pre-Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high, go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It won't stop!

[Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, and I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, cause we comin' for you anyways

[Pre-Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high, go for what you know
Yeah, Macadelic...
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop cause

[Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
I told you it won't stop cause
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed
Soon as she’s gone and take up
Hours out my day just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it
Even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean the sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh you left your phone behind?
Identity crises break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, choking
Or soaking up game, I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding
You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia
Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather, you

[Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Outro]
(women moaning)



[Verse 1]
It's the, rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rapping head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g pass, none of your fucking beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish them
Tryna find a balance reaching from my equilibrium
Fools I pity them, I'm not a human I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'till the angels come and skipping all the famous functions
How do the famous function?
The A list can't be trusted
I strong arm them like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich this is piracy (piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me

[Hook]
Cause everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies

[Verse 2]
Uh, okay
My mind is Yoda I'm on Ayatollah
These other rapper just a diet soda
I find Jehova in the darkest places
Empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen go ahead and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
Don't come up missing
Tell your bitch that you've been trippin' now you on vacation
Rapping like it's automated
Lights I keep em' on like Vegas
Love I'm making so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star I'm way farther with the constelations
Contemplating suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind it's a prison homie leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets
Ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewriting history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Running to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle I'm a show you the commercial
I've been popping like a kernel
Reading Justin Beiber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope

[Hook]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

[Hook]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy,only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever



[Intro: Chris Brown]
Lil Dicky, ooh
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I woke up Chris Breezy, oh my god I'm the man (oh shit)
I’m so fly and I can dance (whoa, whoa shit)
There’s tattoos on my neck (oh, oh)
I just FaceTimed Kanye (blip, blip)
I told him I’m his biggest fan, yeah (yeah)
Got all these hoes in my DM (yeah, I do)
Holy shit, I got a kid (oh)
Ohh, I can sing so well
Wonder if I can say the n-word (wait for real?)
Wait, can I really say the n-word?
What up, my nigga? (woo) What up, my nigga?
Big ups, my nigga, we up, my nigga
You pussy ass nigga, man, fuck y’all niggas
'Cause I’m that nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
I’m that nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can’t believe that it's Freaky Friday
Yeah, it’s Freaky Friday
I’m in Chris Brown's body
I drive his Ferrari and I’m light-skinned black

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
(Ring ring) What the fuck?
I woke up and I'm Lil Dicky (Lil Dicky?)
Ugh, what the fuck?
This shit is real weak
How his dick staying perched up on his balls like that?
Walking down the street and ain’t nobody know my name (whoa)
Ain’t no paparazzi flashing pictures, this is great (whoa)
Ain’t nobody judging 'cause I’m black or my controversial past
I’ma go and see a movie and relax (woo)
Ayy, I’m a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch
Wait, if I’m in Dicky’s body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter’s in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can’t believe that it’s Freaky Friday
Yeah, it’s Freaky Friday
I’m in Chris Brown's body
I look at my soft dick with delight, it’s my dream dick

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky & Chris Brown]
If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I’m tryna to find myself like an introspective monk
I’m balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter? Fuck
Now I’m at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won’t let me in
I don’t know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(I can't believe)
I can’t believe that it’s Freaky Friday

[Outro]
Lil Dicky: Wait, what the fuck?
Ed Sheeran: And now I'm in Ed Sheeran’s body
It’s way less cool than being Chris Brown was
Lil Dicky: What the fuck again?
DJ Khaled: I’m DJ Khaled
Why am I yelling?
Kendall Jenner: Huh, I'm Kendall Jenner
I got a vagina, I’m gonna explore that right now (woo, woo)
Holy shit, I got a vagina (uh), I'm gonna learn
I’m gonna understand the inner workings of a woman



[Intro: Lil Dicky & Fetty Wap]
LD, AKA The Independent Variable
Trap God, and we servin' out the hallway

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Fuck I need gold for man?)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Fuck I need clothes for man?)
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow dat, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ayy, we gon' save that money
What we doin'? We gon' save dat money

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
The rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on 'em
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed (No)
Those margaritas not goin' on my card (No)
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L the Jew biz major?
Fuck you know about the world he raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday (It's true)
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away (It's true)
Book flight December but I leave in May (I do)
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby?
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby?
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I’m so Jewish)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I’m so frugal)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm so imprudent)
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin' like a preacher
I can take his ass to church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I could...

[Interlude: Lil Dicky]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know what a full verse would have been too expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie (Please)
Hair cut several months in-between, homie (Always)
Hit the mafuckin' lights when I leave, homie (YOLO)
Single ply TP, ass bleed
Airbnb the motherfuckin' lease, I'm never there
I'm out in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
At happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
And that applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees, phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it (All the fam)
401k, rollin' over bands on it (Ayy)
Coppin' sweaters in the summer when the sale on 'em (I'm hot)
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpaying for it

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby?
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby?
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I’m judicious)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I’m cost efficient)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I do it different)
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover (Never)
Low thread count, hard with the covers (Woo)
Free trial memberships, doe
I never join the shits doe
Fuck you think this is doe?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch though
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite a bit
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans though
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands, though
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
My dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me, well I fuckin' don't!

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby?
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby?
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (1738)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I'm a kike)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (I eat figs)
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Every time these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up 'cause all about the bands, baby
800k underneath the bed baby

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Vs the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [sniff]
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed



[Intro: Lil Dicky & Juanita]
Hello, how can I help you?
Hi, my name’s Dave Burd. I have an appointment today
It’s probably under 'Lil Dicky,' actually. I’m a… I’m a rapper, so…
Okay, and who are you here to see?
Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here 'Snoop D-o-g-g'
Oh, yeah. He’s right down the hall. First door to your right
Give him a knock and he should be right with you
Thanks. It’s uh, this door right here, right?
Mm-hmm
Thank you

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky & Snoop Dogg]
Grab a seat
Thanks I’m Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I’m a big fan of the shit that y’all make
I can’t lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there’s a reason that we called, Dave, let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much
I wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain’t never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I’m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
When you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Ha, look at that, I can say there’s something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my god, it’s the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It’s never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It’s kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn’t do shit
And I don’t even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that’s my niche!
Don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed
That’s the target I’ll hit
And that’s the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don’t know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don’t mean any disrespect by that
I’m just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky & Snoop Dogg]
So what are your biggest strengths?
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain’t nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer
All right, all right, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I’m pretty damn clever (Go)
Got a long bottom bitch, call the hoe Neville (Whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh)
You can say I’m pretty smart how I know better
And y’all been winning like Pistorius, it’s no feat
Bro, I can go on and on
I’m taking over and they mad like father-in-laws
OK enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different than the other guys
Well I don’t know if they can run it like that
But ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap
What’s that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?
I don’t get it
Nah it ain’t like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like, as a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain’t finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?
Yeah, I guess... so what you tryna do
Five years from now, tell me 'bout the dude
Well, I don’t care about the money
Like, it’s the respect that I’m wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don’t wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what’s your legacy?
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
Put the random rap in demand like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap start to recognize that anti-rap
Is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain’t mad at that
Well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I’mma rap the plaques
And I ain’t about to win them back to back
I’m bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain’t even sold a damn album yet
True
That’s a lot of talk from a wily vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain’t a book nigga
Well that’s one of my flaws, I’m too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddar's involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain’t done shit
Think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I’m like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don’t know if it’s your worst shit
You don’t think finding out would be worth it?
It might be, it might not
But I’mma put your ass to work, kid
Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together
What would you do for the hook for this song?
You want me to make a hook up right now?
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
All right, uh, okay
Man do the hook!
I’m bout to be professional
Homie, I’m professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?
Nigga, that shit is garbage man
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah, you know, I’m just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?
Right now?
Yeah
Sure

[Outro: Lil Dicky, Snoop Dogg & (Juanita)]
Dope. Juanita, bring some weed in here, please. Thank you
(You got it, Snoop. I’ll be right there.)
Thanks, Juanita. Super nice woman
Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?
Uh, I really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so…
Whatever. Thanks
(Hey, I got y’all y’all weed.)
Damn, that’s some great looking weed. It’s just so early
(Can I get you guys anything else while I’m here? Coffee? Tea? Head? Bottled water?)
D-Did you just say head?
(Yeah. You ain’t never got no head before?)
I mean… Just feels like… A lot, right now
(Ok.)
But what kind of tea do you guys have?
(We got mint, raspberry, Earl Grey, English Breakfast...)
Actually, I’ll take head
(I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head.)



[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Ayy, ayy, damn
L tapped twice on some ass, like grams
I just fucked, ay
Now what I'm doing?

[Chorus: Lil Dicky]
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy
(Do you fuck with the war?)
I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch, ayy

[Verse: Lil Dicky & Brain]
I'm like, "Girl, that was great, talk about a connection
Am I alone in my praise, do you share my assessment?"
She like, "Yeah, that was nice, I enjoyed myself"
"Great", "Yeah"
She like, "Can you reach that shelf for my phone?
I'll take care the alarm"
I'm like, "Oh, for the morning, like, to sleep?"
She like, "Yeah, we just had sex, what did you think?
I was just gonna fuck you and leave?"
"No, I— I hadn't thought that far ahead
But of course, can I get you a t-shirt—
Oh, can you not tickle my hair?
It's just a personal thing, it's not you"
"Okay, sorry for doing it"
"No, no, it’s just a personal thing, it’s not you"
"Okay, cool"
"Yeah, uh, so, you're from Minnesota?
Only thing I know is that it's colder
Break it down, how's it compare to living in LA?"
"Well, I can't compare them, they're so different
You know what I'm sayin'?"
"Yeah, for sure"
She like, "Apples to oranges"
"Well, you can still compare them, but I hear you
What's the deal with your family? Got any siblings?"
She like, "I have a brother"
I'm like, "Oh, what he do?"
She like, "He in the Army"
"Oh, true
Uh, do you fuck with the war?"
She like, "Huh? What did you just say?"
"Huh? Like, just now?" "Yeah"
"Do you fuck with the war?"
"No, I don't fuck with the war"
I'm like "No, I don't fuck with the war!
Just don't know how to react to the forces
I should have just thanked you, of course—"
"Uh, why would you thank me?"
"Uh, I guess I assumed it extended to families
But, okay
While we on the topic, I been actually thinkin' about some shit
About the Army and Navy
What if tomorrow is the day
That the fucking aliens came
And invaded our nation?
Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit?
Like, do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?
Or not at all, like, would they just walk up in this motherfucker
Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate
Without a hint of intimidation?
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race?
Granted, I don't know the alien heart
But, you get what the fuck I'm saying?
Like what the fuck would it be like?
Would they be like "Earth go hard"
Or is it just another conquest?
Or would they be like, "Damn, Earth go hard"
"They was harder than Simian"
You ever talk to your brother about this, uh, type of stuff?"
Then she like, "No"
I'm like "Well, what you think?"
She like "I don't concern myself
With hypotheticals that couldn't be"
I'm like, "Girl, what you mean?"
She like, "I don't believe"
"In the war?"
"In aliens"
"Oh, hold up, hold up, wait
Girl, what you sayin'?
That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?"
"I guess"
"What an enormous coincidence that shit would be
Do you see what I'm sayin'?"
"I can't hear what you're sayin'"
"Well, the universe always expanding
There are infinite galaxies (infinite)
Why would we be the anomaly?"
She like "That's no coincidence, I call that shit God"
I'm like "Oh, you're religious, bitch
You think it's all God?"
"No, I know it's all God"
"No, I know that there might be a God
First off, nobody knows there's a God
Girl, I think we should drop this"
"No, what's goin' on in your brain right now?"

(Brain) Ayy, Brain on some other shit though
I been all up in the club for a year, hey (Brain)
I been killing shit, don't mind me
Uh, I'm just top flight
Uh, I could sure use a Sprite
I'm thirsty as fuck
Who getting money? That's Brain (Brain)
Who make decisions? That's Brain (That's Brain)
Who make the hits? That been Brain (Oh, that Brain?)
Who run this whole operation? That been Brain since—
"Brain, can you just get back to the issue here?"
Uh, "Really?" Can you just remind the Brain?
"You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if He exists"
Don't call Brain names
The Brain couldn't recall
But if I'm not mistaken, this bitch to my left
Guaranteed there's a God
"I believe in a God, yes"
So, God never wrong?
God never wrong, right?
"Yeah, that's, like, the whole point"
"Brain, just get there, please"
Hold up
So, God made the Earth
And God was like, hold up
This shit is boring
It need more shit
God was like, "I'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch
Dinosaurs on that bitch"
Then He like, "Why'd I put dinosaurs on that shit?"
"What is your brain even saying?
Can he get to the point?"
“Hold up, Brain, you just did it!
God ain't wrong, what the fuck was He thinking?”
”About what?”
“Bitch, the dinosaurs
He made the Earth for them
But then He like, 'Nah'?
'Dinosaurs are just blah'?”
”What's your point?”
“'I'ma cook up some blondes'?
Like, He was way off
I don't look like a dinosaur
Ho, them things thirty-five feet
I'm like five-foot eleven” (Up on Tinder, I'm six-foot)
“Seen that Bronchiosaurus?
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven (Good shit Brain)
And that's just an expression, bitch
There ain't no heaven”
”Ha, funny”
“I'm just messin', but if he ain't wrong
I guess this the exception”
”Can I talk now?”
“Go ahead”

”Look, everything in life has purpose
You, chickens, a midget at a circus”
“What? I don't interpret”
She like, ”That's not for me to determine”
“So dinosaurs' purpose was to just die?”
”That's not for me to determine”
“But—okay”
”I'm just a person”
“Okay, but think of the root of the argument, girl
View how we started this, girl
Like, you don't believe in the aliens"
"Yeah, I just—"
"You confine God to Earth, girl, I find that shit salient”
”I just don't presume to know the plan”
“Bitch, me neither, but that's not what I've been saying”
”But what are you saying?”
“Why can't God fuck with aliens?
Why can't Earth just be like
A fuckin' small side project for this guy?”
”Okay, look, we just don't see eye to eye”
“Yeah, but logically, like, you don't believe in your side”
”Well, you're bringing up fuckin' dinosaurs
Like, we could have shared the Earth with them, nobody knows”
“Yeah, there is hard soil evidence, girl
Like what's next, you don't fuck with Pangaea?”
She like, ”Let’s change the subject”
“Okay”
This bitch don't know 'bout Pangaea
"Brain, leave it alone"

“I'm starving, are you hungry, by chance?”
”Oh, my God, I'm so hungry”
“Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?”
”Fuck yeah”
“Fuck yeah, I'm on it
Also, I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing”
"Come on, dude, I'm a grown up
I'm capable of having intelligent conversations”
“Okay, I just—fuck it
Back to this pizza, I lean pepperoni”
”Ugh”
“Sausage?”
”How can you eat that shit?”
“No, no, no, this not Domino's, this legit
It's high quality meat and shit”
”No, no, I'm vegetarian”
“Oh, right, well, we can get half pepperoni
And half of whatever you like”
”Ugh, ew, I can't have that shit in the same box”
“Seriously?" "Yeah" "You're that against meat?”
”No, I'm that against us being gluttonous
Thinkin' that animals live on this earth to get eat”
“Okay, is it how we treat them?”
”Uh, that sure doesn't help”
“Okay”
She like, ”I'm not opposed to us hunting
But now we not trackin' them down
We just breed them to eat, that's disgusting
You should honestly read on the subject”

“All right, hold up
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens
We just set the place to do our hunting intelligently enough
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want”
”That's my point, we just incubate animals
Instead of just letting them live how they come”
“But, that's just your God at work, bitch
Why we go hard on Earth
What you think would happen right now if you left my place
And there were like three wolves waiting for you?”
”Wolves?”
“Bitch, they would tear your ass up!
Viciously, like, they would eat your titties”
And your pussy
“That's what they do”
And your face and shit
“Humans are smarter, bitch, that's what we do”
She like, ”Apples to oranges”
“Bitch, that phrase don't make no sense!
Why can't fruit be compared?”
She like, ”I'm gonna leave”
"There's just all of these conflicting principles"
”Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza”
“I will, that's my God-given right”
She like, ”Where is my bag?”
“Oh, that leather one next to the trash?
That's the one, right? Made out of cow, I think?”
”Ugh, why are there no Ubers in this area?”
“So you don't eat the meat, you just be wearing the shit”
”I'm not listening, dude”
“That's barbaric as shit
Do you come from the vikings?"
”Why are you even still talking?”
“Do you take peoples' land?”
”I'm not listening, dude”
“Do you fuck with the war?”
”How are there no Ubers anywhere?”
“Just download Lyft, they are bigger in presence out here”
”I don't wanna add shit to my phone”
“Okay, the choices are clear, ho
Ubers are not around here, ho
Taxis will come, but they real slow”
Ayy, the Brain gotta poop
T minus five 'til the Brain gotta shit
”I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitchy"
“Uh, look, do you just want to sleep here?”
”Uh, no thanks”
“It's past 2 am”
”I'm not sharing a bed with you”
“You can sleep in my bed, I'll sleep on the floor”
”Fine, you're sure?”
“Yeah, it's cool
I won't throw you out to the wolves”
”Oh, my God, you are so annoying”
“I couldn't help myself
But can you at least throw me a pillow?”

[Chorus: Lil Dicky]
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy
(Do you fuck with the war?)
I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch

[Outro: Lil Dicky & Brain]
Brain gotta poop, still
Please don't neglect the Brain
Please don't neglect the Brain
"Hold on, is that my Lyft? I don't know if I—"
"Nah, I got a pizza
Full pepperoni, too
So, you're not gonna wanna be a part of it"
But first you should poop
Please don't neglect the Brain



[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah... man, this is the softest thing I ever did
But... it's about something that's pretty important to me

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And that's you
And that's true
Really wish that I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Fuck it, I don't even know what I could've done
Looking back thinking, "That's what I should've done"
Wanting you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
But she knows what I'ma do with the new songs
And she know I'm pretty soon with your dude on, running the rap game
With that lane always gotta be up on that train
Or that plane, ain't nobody want to feel that pain
With that strain wishin' I ain't gotta get that fame
Or acclaim, you know I'd give you my last name
Put that blame on me, chasin' something, feelin' dumb cause you all I need
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I never know when that's gon' be
And I'm sorry

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
It's the hardest rule to follow
(I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you
(What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe
If I woke up and I called it quits
(I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this
(I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And that's you (that's you)
And that's true (that's true)
Really wish that I didn't
Care about you anymore (care about you anymore)
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life
(had life, had life, had life)

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
When I'm being dumb and stupid who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfuckin' jerk face?
Who gon let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who gon let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap
Ever since I been alone I've been thinking back
Listenin' to your autotune in my mike-phone making us laugh
You know the past was a blast but it never could last
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny, doing nothin's never nothin' when it's somethin' with you
You know I want to still talk, even text and call
Whenever something's going on I be pressin' "Mol" up in the phone
'Til I press the "x," stressed, the next one I'll best the ex and you'll forget, but it's best
You the best to me girl, always baked me something
And when it ripped off, you replaced my buttons
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
Cause even when I can't say "love ya," I love ya

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
It's the hardest rule to follow
(I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you
(What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe
If I woke up and I called it quits
(I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this
(I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow (oh)
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And that's you (that's you)
And that's true (that's true)
Really wish that I didn't
Care about you anymore (care about you anymore)
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life
(had life, had life, had life)

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
It's the hardest rule to follow
(I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you
(What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe
If I woke up and I called it quits
(I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this
(I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby



[Verse: Lil Dicky]
Ain’t no doubt about it, shit is coming
And I’m just praying that Lil Dicky love it
Always told myself that this the type of shit I wanted
I was being honest, even made a promise
Not with anybody else, this was inner conscious
Talking to my fucking self, das' a little bonkers
I know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer
I hope that ain't even my concern though
You know I’ll be working till I get what I deserve
Whatever totems I get personally you know I’ma earn those
This ain't even 'bout some shit up on a checklist
This about the fact that I’m about to test this
I’m about to figure out what my best is
I can't avoid it because now ya' boy invested
And I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it
Pretty reckless, pretty restless 'cause
I’ve lived my life expecting love
To come the second my attempt was done, and yeah, I guess
To some extent I was correct because I’m getting buzz
But now I’m 'bout to be ubiquitous, look it up
Yeah, or that’s at least what I’m assuming
But as alluded to reality is looming and
Now ya' dude about to make a move and take the truth
And hope to god that when he through
That what he thought about is proven
But honestly, I'm not afraid that it’s delusion
I’m hot enough to where I know it’s not illusion
But obviously I been finding this confusing
This ain’t even close to what I thought I would be doing
Don’t get me wrong, I was born to be big
But I always figured it would be the comedy thing
So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings
What big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me
And as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted
Was high class as I mastered my craft, and
Goddamn, who’da thought it get like this
Back in twenty-ten music wouldn’t make that list
I’m talking top five-to-ten strengths, with no winks
I would not lie, my pen dry, with no ink
Or, that’s at least what I thought 'til I clawed and scratched the pen 'til I saw a line draw
Then I coulda let bygones be bygones
But I really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn
Like where the fuck is my peak at?
Not Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that
Not crowned yet, but I don’t think I decreed that
Not loud, but you know I’m ready to tweet that
I just really hope I’m ready to be that
Now you seeing where D’s at
'Cause even though I’m softer than a tissue
I ain't nothing to sneeze at
I’m smarter, where fuck ya' degrees at
And I ain't harder but I’m hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at
I’m 'bout to come in and desaturate
The chic rap today and evaporate
The feedback I hate, I elaborate
At a later date
But I’m getting off the point with the player hate
What the fuck was I saying, oh yeah
I’m kind of a slave
To my ambition, I ain't quittin' till my shit is appraised
And I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy
But that just means that it’s further away
So, Burd about to work until he turn in his grave
It’s really burdensome when earning something’s fun for the day
But I’m concerned about da' burning out from upping the stakes
I’m always uppin' the stakes
I’m taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks
We exploring the discussion of great
They assuring me that when I’m more elite I’ll be secure and amazed
But this isn’t insecurity mang…
Like this the opposite of that, confidence in fact
My biggest problem is I can't honestly relax
Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts
And I made a promise that I can't be the body
That’s stopping it, think I need a lobotomy
Lil Dicky the prophecy, little bit of anomaly, not a commodity
Not a façade, or a lotta da Comedy prodigies
Commonly brought up wit Dicky
Feelin' weird, lemme think of an analogy
Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality
Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality
Was people that conform to the ruralest localities
To Russell though it was nuffin' but normality
And he really nice up on the plow in actuality
Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality
And so da mutuality was somewhat rationality
So then ya man made a plan of practicality
Not even a plan, it was more of a formality
Get a little land and attend to its vitality
Then raise a little fam 'til it all became finality
The strategy was just to stay in the course
And do ya chores, when ya' happy ya' ain't need to abort
Never explored nothing less he rollin' round on his horse
Then one day he was up on his horse
That’s when he went past the porch, the path he normally
Passes forth was fast and short, was after more
Went faster north, amassed a lure to master more
And then discovered the court
He like ya! Let me down Tim
Hopped off, lookin' puzzled at the round rim
Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then
Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded
Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it
And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin' sound friction
Up in a swish make and he was confounded
Because he knew that he had found him
But right now; it was still for the fun
Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done
Then the walking turned to running, and the hoppin' turned to jumping
And dunking, and Russell had to keep coming
Because the young’n was fucking disgusting and loving it
Running it, all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him
'Cause he was butter and hungry, hung jury
'Cause stories of glory, not normally for people like him
Then the word got around up to ESPN
And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym
Bunch a grown men lookin' to belittle the kid
Because to those men, ball was the reason to live
And the G.O.A.T.S. they been all in since they was kids
So this goat owning mafucka look like a dick
And even know Russell knows that, he doesn’t submit
He just chills with a grin
And then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge
Make it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men
Lookin' better than his predecessors ever could get
Turned the animosity to respect
And then the Thunder called him
Said they heard a lot about the ballin'
Told him that they wanna get involved and
Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it’s so appalling
Oklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty
Awesome, errbody laud him
Erry-bitty lookin' like they really fucking fallin'
Condominium is so legitimate it’s sprawling
And this muthafucka on the court straight ballin'
Cash all up in that ass, lol’ing at the past like
Where the fuck would I be at up on the other path, right?
If I never stumbled 'pon the game then think of that life
Shit, who taking care of my farm?
Who taking care of my farm?
Who taking care of my farm?
I really loved that farm, uh

[Outro]
CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE
Five-hundred million now that’s a pound cake
According to Jay Z, and Drake…
But greatness ain’t about cake



[Verse 1]
Drunk, faded
Browned out, looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady
Young Man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday
I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl look back at Dave
Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway
That's what I thought not what I said to her
'Stead I walk up to her like, "I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit"
She's like, "Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about?"
I'm like, "Aw..." Pulling out my phone like a boss
YouTube 'bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up
I'm like, "Hold up, how did... that's not even me
Like, I don't jerk off mobily..."
Then her friends coming up and wanna know if everything is okay
I'm like, "Naw, this a rape, you can't tell?
Gimme a break, please. Get the heck away."
I turned to her, "Let me buy you a drink," she like, "Fine."
Told the man, "Two Patron," she like, "Lime."
Said he tried twice, the card got declined
I'm like, "Alri—, is this a—
Could it be a machine issue?" He was like, "Naw,"
I was like, "Obviously there's something wrong
I got dough, like I'm not broke...
I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago."
He like, "Dude, I don't know."
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself
So I'm like

[Pre-Chorus 1]
"Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed
In my room I've got a TV, plus I recently did sheets
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door
Like with the crushed ice"

[Chorus]
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak

[Verse 2]
The girl from the first verse
Somehow let me fuck
Fast forward, seven months, we in love
Some real serious relationship type shit
Despite this, I ain't fucked for days
Tried last night, but was pushed away
But I've been acting well behaved today
I smell okay, Adele Pandora's playing
Now she laying on the floor
And I'm praying this bitch is horny, I go and give her a smooch
She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs
Bad move, she don't like that
Bad mood, her boss being mean to her
Via email, she wanna write back
I'm like, "Right now?"
She like, "Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?"
"Oh, okay, what's the context?"
Then she like, "Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me."
"Who's Jane again?" I said,  she like, "Wow, you should know that..."
"Okay, I guess I forgot," she like, "Dude, that's my other boss."
"Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss
Go to the other boss, before you? Right?"
"But Jane isn't hands on!" she yelled
"Okay, well I just don't understand the dynamic then
I don't work with these people." She started crying
"Wait stop, what the fuck is this?"
"Naw, you don't ever take my side."
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side
We in bed, hands on her good thighs
I try to kiss, she like, "Good night" but I'm like

[Pre-Chorus 2]
"Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet
And supportive aunt during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles
Now reward it."

[Chorus]
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak

[Verse 3]
Fast forward some more, June sixteenth, twenty seventy four
Old LD looking old as fuck, still with the same ho, holding up
But my life sucks, legs hurt, friends dead, real terse
My dick looking like it's tinfoil
Her tits looking like they hard boiled eggs
On top of that, she insane
Like, I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days
Maybe months, who knows, probably going to die soon
Pretty scared, I ain't even gonna lie to you
Think about it all day, on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in fifty seven
I took five, that's a bit excessive
I look high, take a look at my thighs
And good God that's a little erection, it'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho, I'm pretty much blind at this point
I don't know if I mentioned that yet, but I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is, I'm like

[Pre-Chorus 3]
"Look, I don't know if you're aware that
You've been throwing out my shoes
What I do know is, I'm sick of doing nothing here with you
All my blood is in my dick, I'm probably dying pretty soon
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying
Please acknowledge that you hear me..."

[Chorus]
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak



[Intro]
"Aye, what's going on man?
It's your boy Lil Dicky
Aka Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis
I got a story for y'all, man
Peep this
Yes sir..! Aiight, let's go"

[Verse 1]
Now I been dating this girl named Katie, she hot as hell
And her body crazy, vagina shaven and it don't smell
And I don't fall for chickens
But this one a little different, body sickening
Plus, she really good at making breaded chicken
Got me thinkin she the one, man
Even fully clothed, shawty really fun man
Get a lotta hoes, but none of those come close
I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposed
Oh yeah there's one more thing
And I know this shit gonna sound insane
But I still haven't hit it
I admit it, I wish I was kidding
Never been up inside before
Because she's only fucked one guy before
And though I really wanna boink this whore
She my sweetie 3.14
So I'm stayin patient and masturbating
And now my heart is sorta racing
Cause she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
Hell yeah, I'm down, I'm 'bout to go all out
I'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake
But on the way to crib, we pass this kid
And he seem to know who Katie is
So I say "Who this?" and she say
"Dicky, this is my ex-boyfriend Jim!"

[Chorus 1]
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at this dude, I can't believe my eyes
Cause he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
He's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod
Man, this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian god
And now I'm lookin at my chick, cause his dick's been inside her raw (fuck that!)
Aw, damn

[Verse 2]
Man this is crazy
I can't believe this guy used to fuck my lady
I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
Katie's hugging and squeezing his shoulder blades
And I'm buggin and queasy, this ain't okay
And then they say, "Let's get drinks" so I say "Okay"
Even though I was about to get laid!
Man this muhfucker look like Ashton
Combined wit a lil Hugh Jackman
In other words, he's so damn attractive
So damn tan, he gotta have a little black in him
Now I'm in the back wit him, sippin on some 'gnac wit him
And he payin for it all, he investment banking
I'm acting like I ain't distracted
But I'm reenacting him and Katie bangin'
And now I'm feelin' pissed, so I go and take a piss
Midstream, I look left and guess who it is
And I had to see, and I was mad discreet
And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
"Oh my god becky, look at that cock!"

[Chorus 2]
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm lookin at his dick, I can't believe me eyes
Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
And now I'm starin at this dude's soft dick with a lot of hate
Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
And I don't know if I can date my girl after tonight
Aw, damn

[Verse 3]
I don't know what to do, dude's dick is really huge
I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
I know she's missing that, my penis isn't that
I'm looking closer, I think that his dick has abs
Six pack on a dick, now what the fuck is that?
It's so long and thick, It's like a punching bag
I'm saying it's so shaven, head is amazing
Got my dick looking like a raisin
Skin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy
What the fuck should I do?
He gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive-thru....
I think it's time to tell Katie my goodbyes
Cause I simply can't survive
After seeing what was in between his thighs
So I tell her

[Chorus 3]
"That this dude's got a dick that I don't comprehend
I had to move my neck to see it end to end
I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
Because the sex with him must have been the best
And I would say let's just be friends
But I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye"
Then she told me, "Dicky, I don't really know what to say
Because I dated this dude in second grade
So I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid"

[Outro]
And then I took her to my crib, and you know that we belly slapped
And I gave her an O like I was selling crack, and when I came, I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh (Oh damn)
And upper mid-section region, you can call that the pelvis
Some would even call that the pubic bone
Leave the pubes at home, making this up on the spot
Fuck you know about it?
I'm about to go paper-mache my own dick and ride it



[Intro]
Bruh, bruh, bruh
LD, aka stem cells

[Verse]
Everybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em' buzzing off the crack like a dope fiend
They saw 'em come up with a Mac, yeah, I'm so Steve
Nowadays, bitches tryna crack, got 'em ODing
Like, how them hoes want to get it with L?
They know it's cold enough to charge, like a letterman sale
If they gon' stand behind the bars, I'm in federal jail
I'm going far like a general mail
On that note, I got the fellas saying "What up," the tape, what up?
The same motherfucker playing with his steak cut up
I'm great, shut up, the flowing, no debate, just us
I'm out of shape, but I'm straight to fuck
Yeah, you know I got a chicken in the condo
I was sick of getting off beat, she a bongo
Now she playing with the hard D, being Rondo
Drunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How I'ma do?
I got your ex coming next like a W do
I gotta flex, I'm the best, now I'm being direct
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press
I'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess
Cause they as real when they rap as a Chia's a pet
They old news, stocks plummet, men's leg hair, they ain't cut it
Forget about your era, Pat Summitt
Finesse writtens
I wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting
Religious like a couple of post-marital Christians
I've been official, Dick Bevetta a living
You better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch
I'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja
My shit is gripping when I run it, how the fuck I be slipping?
I be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed
I take chick, pee, and smash, I call it hummus
And I be funny with this shit, I'm just playing
But still nobody fucking with the kid, I'm just saying, ah
Got a chicken parm on the date, it seem
But I don't even know the broad, she just grating the cheese
I don't even got a job, I just blaze and free
But still they give a boy bands, 98 Degrees
So come fuck with me
I got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me
And I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky
And I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me
Hey, that's a good ass life
Only thing I got left, find a good ass wife
But yo, I gotta hit these hoes first, don't tell Mom
But in a year I'ma bend over Michelle Obama
Bruh, you know I gotta do it while I'm hot
I'm tryna get blew in most states, like Barack
I'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put her on D till we O, J Watt
I never hit the scene, when I do, I'm high and wasted
I'm fucking with them jeans, love them bitches high waisted
I run around your team, you a player but I'm Naismith
And I Command V, while you copy, I just paste it, face it
Hotel got 'em puffing on the L, going harder than some hail, you ain't knew it
If everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude spitting better than your dude, can't do it
Telling me, damn, you got bitches, damn, you got hoes
Damn, you got money, but damn, I got flow
Damn, you got riches, damn, you got clothes
Damn, you got honeys, but damn, I got soul, hold up
This shit I'm making's always tight, it's like a yoga store
They all up in the other boat, it's why I'm overboard
I'm taking time to do it right, it's like a soda pour
Cause we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for
I been packing the band-wagon, the man cracking
The man packing the stands, had them clapping they hands
Tagging they Grams, Manhattan was ham
Slapping the fans, playing having the plan
Fans rapping the jams, sagging my pants
You see the type of shit I do on the track?
Hot shit, like I poop in the jacket
Won't mack your bitch, but yo, I'm bout to come and mack your clique
Your whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)
I yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio
They ball all retarded, Cuba Gooding up in radio
I long for the moment I can say that's not debatable
I'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a Snapchat
Aflac, duck the dude, I'm going hard for the grind, but I tuck this move
I made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew
These bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew
I'm too nice, like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo twice
As in double as fuckable as he was and dude tries
To be subtle and get her cuddling
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles
And ending up befuddled when she don't fuck him
And someone tell him, “Listen, you bugging
She never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble?” but he rebuttal with
"I think I just love her, so I would shudder at the thought
Of being anything other than nice?" (I’m that nice)
Heat bang like I caught a body/port-a-potty
It wasn't even deep, dang, shit is still a hobby
It's too bad bitches sleeping on me, threesome
'Cause now these bitches want to help, but he don't need none
I'm all time, like the Wall at the Bank
You've no shot, like you drawing a blank
Honestly, you probably couldn't hang, man, I've been drawing a blank
Giving you lines, while you sitting there and drawing a blank
So go in the rink, chilling like it's dough in the bank
And I’m flowing danker than a grower in Napa
Growing the stankest cannabis
Doing rap and pro-est smacking the hoe-est rappers
And showing the total package, like my flaccid is growing fatter
Samoan cracker, dapper rapper, had to keep going
Yeah, that rap is a rap, I know you rappers napping, don't know it
There’s a dagger pita pappa, tapping on the window
It’s a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store
And I be snapping, I mean I be splashing on the - pane me your rain
Falling quicker than Aladdin for his dame
Are you better than me?

[Outro]
Bruh



[Chorus]
And y'ain't even want it wit da boy
Cuz the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Verse 1]
Shit, i'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision
For a white boy
Holl atcha muthafuckin kike, boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's aight boy
They ain't suspicious of Jews
I'll show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan wit a few kids
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean Tyler Perry's never live
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive (food chains)

[Chorus]
And y'ain't even want it wit da boy
Cuz the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Verse 2]
Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin, they don't grub except for takin' them pills, foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements, I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother...to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves wit a horrible face
[Seal interlude]
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a bag and be on my way, but good luck girl!

[Chorus]
And y'ain't even want it wit da boy
Cuz the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Outro]
Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like, amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot
Because like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out
It's like the perfect filler word

When the block starts to get hot he know I'll hide his burners

He ain't stupid enough to lose me to another nigga in them streets
Ooh, they salty, I know they salty
Please say the barbie, he say the barbie

Pull up on a bum bitch and be like what up sis?

These bitches can't see me, they should all be reading braille
Pull off in that GT with some Seagram's Ginger Ale

You will never be Nicki, and that's the real key-key

Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('sta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, grrra-ta-ta-ta-ta)

[Outro: Post Malone]
Star, star, rockstar, rockstar, star

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload

Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies

You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

[Intro]
Oooh, I fall apart
Oooh, yeah, mmhmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough (yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (yeah)
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain (yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought



[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh



[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha, uh
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Outro]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
Ice cold with the flex
Haha, that shit hard

Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus
I know you remember (I know you remember)

[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)

[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young Gu-wunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the name
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made



[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back Turbo
Baby

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I love that blue race
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 1: Gunna]
'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' this rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two, and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young Gun wanna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
Ten K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Bro got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hate just contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' that M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I love that blue race
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clone
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I pour me an eight

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I love that blue race
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade



[Intro: Drake & Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look

[Verse 1: Drake & Gunna]
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

[Outro: Drake, Lil Juice & Gunna]
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
You seen the overseas drip?



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got woodgrain on my Damier Buckle
Cool quarter mill in my Goyard duffle
I won again so you still gotta shuffle
Born with the drip and just learned how to hustle
Look at your bitch through these Dior bifocals
I get me some head, she bend that shit over
They say lately I been lookin' like dollars
Pinstripe high waters, I dress like a golfer
We ride in foreigns, ain't no more Impalas
They ain't have the new born but I got baby bottles
Shoppin' at Barney, I drip like a model
Watch how I drip when I hit that Met Gala
Codeine I sip with my lip, don't get splattered
Doctor told me I got l lean in my bladder
Run through this cash like family don't matter
I got your back, feel the same pain together
Pop off the tag, my palm angels sweater
Baby blue Jag made my mom feel better
Fucked a snow bunny at my show at Coachella
VVS damn they pointers in my bezel
We move too fast, it get slimy as ever
Life is too grimy, I watch for the devil
It's a Rolls Royce, and it comes with umbrellas
2018 and that Porsche Carrera

[Chorus]
Goyard pouch (hey)
Racks in the quarter ounce (hey)
Two accounts (hey)
Large amounts, ooh
Shop around (hey)
Designer down, ooh
Drip or drown (hey)
Drip or drown, ooh

[Verse 2]
Killin' these hoes, need to call paramedics
New Fendi runners, I feel athletic
Run that shit up, bought my partner a Patek
Blowin' this cash, it was times we ain't have it
Got twenty-one bitches, I must be a savage
Cook in the kitchen, the dope smell like acid
Pourin' this Hi-Tech, I'm sippin', relaxin'
Vibes in LA, Gunna fuckin' the baddest
FN it's plastic, put him in a casket
I wiped his nose quickly, pass him a napkin (slime)
Got an addiction, in love with this fashion
Prayin' for all of my bros like we Catholic
Lifetime of hats 'cause you always be cappin'
Niggas ain't eatin', stop cappin', you ain't fastin'
Can't get no sleep 'cause my life is all action
See how shit happened, I made it in rappin'

[Chorus]
Goyard pouch (hey)
Racks in the quarter ounce (hey)
Two accounts (hey)
Large amounts, ooh
Shop around (hey)
Designer down, ooh
Drip or drown (hey)
Drip or drown, ooh

Take her shoppin' I got good taste (Good taste), I approve her fit of the day
You ain’t goin out like that, no way (No), I drip too hard every day (Drip)

[Chorus: Gunna & Lil Durk]
Shoppin' spree for fun, she did Saint Laurent (Uh)
Alexander, Laurent (Yah), private flight to Milan ('Lan)
Ice VVs (Ice, ice), ice VS1s (ice VS1s)
Off-White, Vlone 1's, foreigns parked in my lawn
Them 40s come, we jump, I like my bitches blonde
Wockhardt gimme the runs, don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go on a hit you can't call off, name hold weight can't raw dog
Off Perks and X can't nod off, if I call you the plug, can't fall off
Turn up



[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a perc, I been itching since noon
Why the brokest the loudest in the room?
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool?
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

[Verse 1]
Bonds in my session, backend through the roof
You gon' make some money, book me for a show
Most of my classmates thought I was a joke
Now look at their faces, I done gave 'em hope
Blue Phantom, I'm like I need me one of those
I built my name up to help the business grow
She freaky, pulled up with out no pantyhose
I'm stacking these benjamins, try not to boast
Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose
Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow
Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
They hope that he rotting out in mildew
Ain't seen him since my first year of high school
I'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mil or two
Ten years been riding, I made sure he had some food
I held that shit down, now look what we can do

[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a perc, I been itching since noon
Why the brokest the loudest in the room?
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool?
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

[Verse 2]
Crew full of winners, no way we can lose
I learned from mistakes, won't take another loss
Vibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall
I rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws
I'm getting that money, money over all
If broke is your problem cash is gonna solve it
If she sell pussy better have some bond nigga
Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog
Making these hits, I'm feeling like a batter
Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall
Gunna don't pay attention to these blogs
They saying shit, I let this money talk
Diamonds on me look like some glass shattered
My bitch's ass fatter, keep a nigga hard
Cars got some custom seats, they can massage
Convertible coming at the end of March

[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a perc, I been itching since noon
Why the brokest the loudest in the room?
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool?
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here



[Verse]
Shoutout my label that's me
I'm in this bitch with TP
I'm in this bitch with 4trey
I just poured up me a 8
Real nigga all in my face
500 racks in my safe
500 racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love
What you know 'bout pullin' up, in Bentley trucks
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoe
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom we used to wear each other clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no mo'
Hold it down for the 4
In the 9 with the woes
Marlo my dawg that's for sho'
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain’t gone fallout bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both my ears on froze
I been gettin faded I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball I don't layup
I'm a big boss and I say so
They’ll wipe you down If I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
40's, on 40's, on 40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina shout out New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz Truck
Hop out fresher than a mento
Lil nigga but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh I got 'em mad, my fault
Talking bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these percs I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangsta but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a vert with a uzi
Twelve get behind me I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
Yeah



[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)

Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young Gu-wunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the name
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Bust down Rollies for the clique
Got these bitches dancing on the dick
They gon' wait in line for this drip
I'ma give her mine, then dip
I'ma try to kill her for the real
Thirty thousand dollars in my ear
I ain't gotta sign no deal
Made a half a mil' last year
I just came home from the can
20 days, whole hundred bands
Got a nigga feelin' like the man
All these bitches knowin' who I am
Hit the ground runnin', I ain't playin'
Put a hundred bricks in the van
Give a thousand pounds to my man
Blow the money fast as I can
Signed to the streets, no advance
Bitches tryna rip me out my pants
'Cause they heard a youngin' gettin' bands
They don't know that I ain't goin' for nothin'
Only gave the bitch a couple hundred
Big dawg, nigga, you a runner
Run off on the plug, change my number
Drop top coupes for the summer

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
We ain't talked in like a week straight
I been all on the interstate
I been tryna go and get this cake
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

[Verse 1]
They thinkin' I lost it, remind them niggas
I can get flyer than niggas
Hundred thousand in a Gucci bookbag
They thinkin' I signed them niggas
I leveled my life up, this Rollie I got on don't tick tock
Still on that bullshit, if you pull up on me, let the stick talk
I'm in L.A. with the vibes, Dane in the cut getting high
She tryna get in my ride, she tryna turn up tonight, yeah
I was running up cash, yeah, I had ran up a bag
And they started gettin' mad, yeah
But I didn't get mad, I just kept getting cash, yeah
Now I'm in my bag, yeah, now I'm in my bag, yeah
She wanna get with me, she know that I'm sticky, but I'm in my bag now
She wasn't fucking with me, she didn't come around, she wishing she had now
And I'm in my bag now
I'm in the bag, the Goyard to be exact
Three hundred racks inside it, and that ain't no cap
I could've bought a Wraith today, yeah yeah
I ran it up, they supposed to hate
I'm digging this lifestyle
Water drippin' on me like I'm a faucet
The crew with me right now
You can play, just proceed with caution
I popped the wrong pill, now I'm nauseous
I need to get off this drank, it's a problem
I took a Tesla and landed on Mars​
Lord please wake me up tomorrow

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

[Verse 2]
They know they can't beat me, so they tryna leave me
And she tryna leave me, but I ain't gon' let her
Diamonds on Fiji, I'm running with QC
And Reebok endorse me, went up a new level
I'm loving this lifestyle and niggas wanna be me
I know they won't catch up, but I ain't gon' let 'em
As soon as the money get up to a million, put it in the ground and then go buy a new shovel
How you gon' be in yo feelings when I'm in my feelings?
We both can't be in our feelings
I ain't gon' lie when you thinkin' I did it, I did it
It's something 'bout your intuition
I'm telling you no lies, I'm tired of seeing you cry
Come here girl, let me wipe your eye
Everything gon' be alright

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

Stay on they ass, stay on they neck
Keep me a check
Viper came yellow, I painted it red
And I paid cash, you heard what I said
Goin' crazy, I been feelin' the rage
Last year I was sittin' in the cage
This year I'm goin' all the way
Taking drugs, tryna ease the pain
I see 'em watchin'
They on my drip, they tryna follow the wave
They on my page
They know that I'm paid, ain't been in town in days
Most of these niggas they old news
All these bitches been ran through

Then spend all the dubs on getting money
Straight from the 'jects to a jet
We been gettin' real fly
Free G-Five, on a G5

Strapped to a T, who want war with us
Dually sit up like an armored truck

EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, "Damn, that makes two of us"
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & 2 Chainz]
It's Young Khalifa, man
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am

This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
I ride or die for mine
I’m ride or die material
Only one life to live, so here we go
(This moment, we own it)

Shopping cart when I go pick up my narcs
So many animals like Noah's Arc
Hop on the chart' and I pop me a Percocet, pour me a fo' befo' it can depart
I land in Cali, my plug pull up on me with pints of the Act
I  don't want no Wockhardt
Make your hoe ride along with me
Got unfinished business, got me feeling like Kevin Hart
Back up, that camera pop out when I park
I got that Draco, come out after dark
Niggas gon' act like they 'bout that life, 'til you pull up on them, see that it's not in their heart
The nigga you think be the coolest  a groupie, he put on a act like he shooting a movie
Kicked them with fashion, I'm talking my dab and they thought it was Newton, then you must be stupid
Trick that bitch make her trap for me like Lucy
We got the keys to the street, I gotta use it
Pull up in my mansion, the crib is extended
The bitches, my nigga, I'm feeling like Pookie
Dat Way, dab at the runway
Got me running to the M&M's, I'm thinking it's a rat race
Ya main bitch on backpage

[Intro: Quavo]
You know what I mean? Migo Gang shit
Flippa
Slaughter Gang, 21 shit
You know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Hit a nigga in the head (Hit him)
We ain't shooting at the legs (Naw)
Back in the day had a trick bike, had a bad bitch on the pegs (Bitch!)
Some of my niggas bang blue (Crip)
Some of my niggas bang red (Blood)
Some of my niggas bang black (GD)
All of my niggas keep straps (Grrah)
Spend three hundred on a napp (Aye!)
They sucking, fuck the whole trap
Bitch, you know my pockets fat (Sloppy)
Quavo walking Warren Sapp (Sacks)
Takeoff buying only Act (Lean!)
You niggas sipping just to act (Actors!)
Bought a Beamer wrapped it matte (Skrt!)
Got a shooter, peep hole out the back (Grraw!)
Never been a minority (Naww)
Take the pot and Chuck Norris it (Oh!)
You niggas looking unfortunate (Woo)
Different types of babies like a orphanage (Babies!)
I hit my money in the storage
I hate when I had to go to court and shit (Hate it!)
You thinking that I'm cooking up porridge (Cooking!)
The way I'm whipping up my wrist and shit (Whip it!)
Damn, this hoe she annoying
After I fuck her, I'm finna get rid of the bitch (Gone!)
What type of shit that he on
Go get the 30 young nigga, go empty the clip (Grraw!)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Slaughter Gang, I'm the king bitch
Mac 90 with the beam, bitch
Hi-Tech, you sipping green bitch
21, hold the pot with my left arm
Catching plays like Brett Favre
You a gold fish and I'm a fucking shark
Whip the pot nigga, whip it hard
AK make a nigga Hit The Quan
Gas bag like I own the farm
She blowing on it like she on a horn
100 round drum and that stick
Pull up, roll the windows down and I hit
You cuffing that bitch and she loyal to dick
Chasing money, I can't lay with no bitch
Murda Gang, we don't play with the beef
Put 'em on a plate and we gonna eat
Niggas snitching, I put 10 on the G's
Margielas, I put rent on my feet
Niggas pussy, I see through 'em they weak
Fuck 12, we keep shit in the streets
I brought her to the spot that bitch was a freak
Fucked her on the floor, can't fuck up my sheets

[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset!
We really invented you niggas
The judge tried to sentence a nigga
Fuck a partner, my .44 my nigga
Stuck in the pickle, grinding from a nickel
Trapping in trenches, two bricks in the rental
I'm crazy I'm psycho, it's 'bout to get physical
Run a circle 'round the plug, that's a pick and roll
Feds watching so I walk on my tippy toes
I'm rich as bitch, I want in on that lick
I'm not romantic, my bullet gon' kiss
Get in that pot, get the work in your wrist
I was born with the gift, got the fame and the grip
Hop in the jet and I take me a trip
Geeked out on codeine, I sip and I sip
Jump off the stage, I might jump out the VIP
I'm covered in money, covered like a quimp
I'm smoking on cookie, not smoking on piff
Don't talk to the police, not giving out tips
That ain’t that boot, that molly look too clear
I don't care what you heard, I jump straight in my Lier
Standing in the kitchen, cooking fish fillet
Run up my money, I stash me a Wraith
Don't run up on me nigga, pump your brakes
I feed you the .223, dinner plate!

[Verse 4: ManMan Savage]
Run up on me nigga, catch a slug
50 and the 40, I don't use a glove
You know we got the straps up in the club
I don't fuck with you, you a dub
21 Gang, we got weight
All of my nigga, we straight
Pull up on a nigga, we'll take
Headshot a nigga, leave him in a lake
Round table with the Migo Gang and the Slaughter Gang, we on break
Bitch too skinny I don't want her, fuck the bitch, the bitch might break
I got a hundred round drum on that K
I keep that bitch with me, you know that bae
Never let a nigga know where I stay
Have a nigga staking out where you stay
I get that cash, I ain't got time to play
Hold up that choppa, this mask on my face
Shoot out the doulie then pull off in the Wraith
Curious George, got bananas in K's
Pussy niggas turn to preachers like Ma$e
Finna slide to where I keep me a K
Juvenile hit a nigga with tre
On Tenwood, post with that K
WOO!

[Verse 5: Rich The Kid]
Whipping a brick with a frying pan
Made a 100 K with a broke hand
Trapping down with the desert eagle
Actavis all in my 2 liter
Finnessing the plug for a whole thang
Rollie all white like the cocaine
I got a freak with a nose ring
Cut that bitch down like I'm 2 Chainz
Walking around with a 100 thou
I'm actually rich, you just talk about it
Pull up with choppers and air it out
I empty the clip in your mama house
Hit a jug for the work, still serving
Get rich or die trying like Curtis
I roll with a brick and she nervous
Pull out the Wraith when I'm flexing on purpose
I started trapping in first grade
I put the lean in a lemonade
I pour a four, got a fever
Dab school, I'm the teacher
Riding scrap with the nina
Big balling, no bleachers
100 K for one feature
Bad bitch, she no keeper



[Hook: Jaden Smith & Rich The Kid]
I’ma jump in it like this
I don’t party with the kids
I get lit and I sit at the crib
You my baby, no bib
I’ma jump in it like this
All I want is the neck
Dive up in it, she wet
Woke up, dreaming ‘bout a TEC
She be my girl from the city
She got a body like Nicki
She put a scratch on the whip
Baby I'll fix it, no biggie
Gotta hit it two times
Gotta cuff her, it's a crime
Bust it open, now it's mine
Put my life up on the line
Swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin'
I roller coaster through the women
They lay their back up on the linen
Yo me and Richy 'bout to get it
They ain't even see it coming
I was broke, turned nothing to something
Maserati in my pocket, just stuntin'
Let me hit it, change my name to McLovin

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Trappin' out a mansion
Made a million dollars, now my diamonds dancing
I was thinkin' 'bout a check
Fuck your bitch, I got her wet
Rich forever, got a deal
Motherfuck how you feel
Fucking a ho out in Calabasas
Spitting the fire like a fuckin' dragon
Why they want to see me broke
Took your bitch and now she broke
I was trappin', selling dope
Double G on the coat
Doors go up on the Tesla
Young nigga, I flex like a wrestler
Kill the pussy, put it on a stretcher
I get geeked like professors
Spending that check and I'm winning
I get head in the Bentley
Ridin' 'round with a semi
I got cheese like the dentist
I'ma jump in it like this
I'ma go- I'ma go dive in a bitch
I'm finally rich
Want a model, take a pick

[Hook: Jaden Smith & Rich The Kid]
I’ma jump in it like this

Let me hit it, change my name to McLovin

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Let me hit it, let me hit it
I can't cuff her, let me flip it
I'ma pass the ho to Jaden
I'ma fuck her if she taken
Walkin' around like a boss
I made me a mill, I'm a boss
This Chanel, no Lacoste
I'ma flex like fuck the cost
Hit from the back then she suck it
She call me daddy, I'm bussin'
Nothin' but money I'm cuffin'
Cook a pot on the oven
Me and Jaden on the hills
Skateboarding, shit for real
I'ma tell you what it is
They was hating on me still
I just might pull out her hair
Freak bitch, no underwear
Sit on my dick like a chair
I can make it anywhere
I was rackin', they was sleepin'
Made a hundred for the weekend
I been preaching like a deacon
You better listen when I'm speaking

[Hook: Jaden Smith & Rich The Kid]

Baby girl tryna stress, me

Put a smile in your face
Either way that Dee wanna
Wanna give you my love
Wanna give you my trust
Spend all of my dubs
How could you play me

You did me shady

All the options that I had, I just wanted love
I can't keep letting you play me, I had enough
Shoulda known you was gonna change like a fake necklace
Now I don't want nothing to do with you I hope you get it
Cuz...

[Chorus: Dee]

Hoes Mad (x24)

[Verse 1]
Hoes mad, hoes mad, I pull up in that old Jag
Hoe fast, I got these bitches staring, comparing
If that's your girl, not sharing, that's past tense
I be flexing, I say "baby why you hating and you wanna drink my liquor?"
But I ain't even tripping, Irv, please pass me a swisher
Smoking dope till I get hiccups, I think I need a pick up
So wanna pick me up, cause these pills got me real high up
But these hoes mad, hoes mad, I think I fucked her best friend
Her cousin, I got these bitches staring
They fighting, they texting me some weird shit
Oh man, hoes mad

[Hook]
Hoes Mad x24

[Verse 2]
Oh man, Oh man, I'm busting hard let me call Flash
Pull up fast, 2 bitches tried to set me up, almost blast
15 up in that pocket rocket, bitch think fast
I can't go, yes I gotta keep it on me
Bitch I'm going out like Tony
I heard these bitches sneaky, tried to get me by my lonely
I'm a duh bitch, not a dummy
I'm all about some money, and where the fuck the liquor?
Drinking Henny till I'm scummy
Whole time, whole time, I'm flexing hard like Busta Rhymes
You worth a dime, I'm all about my Peso, yayo
Need all mine, yo bitch she on my other line
Press decline, hoes mad

[Hook]
Hoes Mad (x24)



[Intro]
Hold up wait, turn me up sis

Sci Fi on the beat

[Hook]
Red hair like Matt Hardy
Fuck your lil bitch she was horny
Yeah I'm riding on a Harley

[Verse]
I swear to God man, I got a shotty
You run up on me and catch a body
A matter fact I got a 30
Oh shit, it's shooting Curry
Back in the day I was broke
Man I was tryna steal some Coke
Jugging niggas sellin' soap
Anything to get that dough
Now a nigga sellin' out at shows
Fucking bitches all in my shows
Alexander McQueen, my clothes
Alexander McQueen, my toes
All this blue cheese on me
Can't fuck with niggas, they phony
Playing bitches just like Sony
Or run up on me, turn into balongna
Oh yeah, all I know is money
I swear to God, I ain't no dummy
Fat daddy, yah duh dummy
We was known for getting money
Poppin' on pills like junkies
Sippin' on lean ain't funny
All these bitches they annoying me
And diamonds on me, it's a surgery
Baby girl said she heard of me
And baby girl get away from me
And yeah, you can't have my baby
I know you heard I was crazy
Bitch I make a nigga do a flip flop
Keep talking shit, get your shit smacked
I ain't with the twitter beef
And you can meet me in the streets

[Hook]
Red head like Matt Hardy
Fuck your lil bitch she was horny
Yeah I'm riding on a Harley
I'm tatted up on my body

[Intro: Big Sean]
I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid, then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far

Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you

You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and everyday I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)



[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look

Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed



[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Don



[Hook: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he gotta deal with

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "ain't no woman like the one I got"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy

Somebody point me to the best ass-eater
Tell 'im "Pussy clean!" I tell them "Pussy squeaky!"
Niggas give me brain ’cause all of them niggas geeky
If he got a Mandingo, then I buy him a dashiki
And bust this pussy open in the islands of Waikiki
Kiss my ass and my anus, ’cause it’s finally famous
And it’s finally soft, yeah, it’s finally solved!
I don’t know, man, guess them ass shots wore off!
Bitches ain’t poppin’, Google, my ass

Y-y-you fuckin’ little whores, fu-fuckin’ up my decors

Give me all your money and give me all your residuals

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power — how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Outro]
(I know you feeling yourself right now.)
(But I'm not sure she's the one — I wouldn't call her, man.)
"Hey, I'm outside."
What are you doing here?



[Produced by Amaire Johnson]

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Hook: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

[Outro: Grandma & Big Sean]
Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you
It's all good, I love you grandma
Bye

[Intro]
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Hook: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Outro]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the makeup, yeah



[Intro: Big Sean]
God, oh, God
Boi, boi
I've been workin' all god damn year, I just got my check
I'm 'bout to spend it all on me, I'm worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (what you see)
Pull up (swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets

[Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now

Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"
I'm on

My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it till it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (what you see)
Pull up (swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now (D-Town)
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Outro]

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Intro: Nicki Minaj & Gucci Mane]
Uh, Gucci
Wanna make love, love, love

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
King of the skreets
And when these suckas see me, they should bow to my feet
And kiss the ground underneath
I look down at the beef
That shit childish to me
Two hundred thousand to see me
And it's been sold out for weeks
Can't brush shoulders with me
These stones in my choker are 2 karats apiece
Look like boulders to me
Damn, who colder than me?
You think he colder than me?
You more bipolar than me
You talkin' crazy
I'm tryna book Beyoncé for my wedding day
I'm the type of nigga, spend a million on a wedding cake
Niggas hate, but hesitate
They hate to see ya elevate
I just left out the gym
I'm 'bout to take a swim and meditate
Woo!
Now it's time to celebrate
Ask me why I'm smilin'
I say, "'Cause I make two mil' a day"
And I might take your bitch and pay her bills
That's how I feel today
And I just wanna fuck
Don't wanna chill, that's how I feel today

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love
I wanna make love, love, love
She say the money make her wanna make love
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ay yo, ain't talkin' housewives, but I'm in the Porsche
First I'ma scorch her, then I'ma torch her
Then I'ma torture her, then I'ma off her
A million dollars for a show, they made their off-er
Go against Nicki, it's gon' cost ya
'Cause now it's fuck ya, intercourse ya
I rep Queens where they listen to a bunch of Nas
I'm a yes and these bitches is a bunch of nahs
Tryin’ to win a gunfight with a bunch of knives
I win, get off the bench and give a bunch of fives
I don't see her
Bitch I'm the greatest, no Kendrick and no Sia
I'm the iPhone, you the Nokia
Everybody know you jealous, bitch it's so clear
Tell them bum ass bitches to play their role
She see my sexy ass every time she scroll
I got it in the can, Dole
Your career gon' be with Anna Nicole
Witcha dumbass face
She ain't eatin' but I swear she got some bum ass taste
Text her man like, "Dawg, how that bum ass taste?"
Pay your rent! And stay in your bum ass place
Oooohhh, oh you the qu-e-e-the queen of this here?
One platinum plaque, album flopped, bitch, where? (bitch, where?)
Hahaha, ahhhhh
I took two bars off just to laugh
You see, silly rabbit, to be the queen of rap
You gotta sell records, you gotta get plaques
S, plural like the S on my chest
Now sit your dumbass down
You got an F on your test

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love
I wanna make love, love, love
She say the money make her wanna make love
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
I love to see the money stack up
Hope that we don't ever, ever break up (up)
Wanna make love, love, love

AK hit your dog, and you can't bring Old Yeller back
Yep Gucci bang up eighty thousand: that's a yellow safe
Yello, holmes. Mellow, holmes. You know you a scary-cat

If I could do it all again, would have kept that girl
But I’m unhealthy for you baby I fuck up your world
You your Daddy's lil girl, but you’s a grown lady
And I don’t see you like he see you cause we not related

I cook good, but he cook way better
Sipping Coronas with my vato
Me casa you know es su casa
Big cat we used to call el gato
Now GuWop they call me El Chapo nigga
I use to trap out all the bandos
Abandoned homes with boarded windows
Who the fuck that is peeking in my window
Fuck boys know I keep that extendo

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Cause my Mak 90 stay with me
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me

[Bridge]
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trappin' off a pack, I'm trap house trap

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You know I got me an agenda
Break that thing up in my blender
Got a warrant, no surrender
Sub-machine with that extender
I came up on a pissy mattress
I got more money then all these rappers
Tried to hit me up in traffic
But I had to work my magic
I'm riding round with my lieutenant
I let 'em count it and I spend it
Bitches come after my business
Catching bodies in these trenches

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Trap house 3 got a K with me
And 3 young niggas that stay with me

[Intro]
An igloo full of snow and a white stove
House full of naked hoes snortin' blow
It's so lonely at the top, plus its real cold
A house full of hoes and they cookin' blow
I'm in Zone Six aka the North Pole
Burr! EA, GA
1-0-1-7, Wop, six

[Verse]
Middle of the winter I pull up in a vert
It's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt
Santa Claus of the hood
I pull up with the work
They call me East Atlanta Santa
Run up on me get murked
I'm just trappin' through the snow
Sellin' nine half a bricks in four ways
Over the hills we go
Got an extendo and an AK (gra, gra, gra)
I'm a neighborhood philanthropist
I'm sellin' bales of cannabis
Preachin' like an evangelist
But I don't fuck with amateurs
I drive spiders, yeah, tarantulas
My diamonds are immaculate
I'm not on no romantic shit
But I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit
I'm so trill, your ho can't handle it
But damn, that bitch can suck a dick
Skeeted on her face and lip
Guwop can't fuck no basic bitch
The teacher teachin' arithmetic
Show you how to whip a brick
Learn you how you run your clique
And told you how to kill a snitch
My young girl she a freaky chick
But damn she on that sneaky shit
Ran off with a half a zip
And now I got to slap a trick
All these record labels broke as shit
Ricky Dinky record shit
I sell more meth than a Mexican
My dog food yea its excellent
I done started sellin' Christmas tree
I'm tryna jingle bells ho
Its Christmas time its Hollis, Queens
I'm stompin' in my shell toes
Christmas time in '96
I asked Santa for twelve golds
But now Guwop got gifts to give
But I don't fuck with twelve though

[Outro]
Santa Claus in the city, bag full of goodies
I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
I'm tryna come down the chimney with a 100 mil
I'm the Bricksquad boss I'm like Santa Claus



[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Wizop, Yeezy Mane
(Mike Will Made It)
Burrr

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bitch stop the comparisons
I'm not these other artistses
I'm Gucci Mane, La Flare
My neck on that real retarded shit
Keep a towel with me
'Cause my watch be drippin' water, bitch
And I only featured Kanye
'Cause we both some fuckin' narcissists
Narcissistic tendencies
With psychopathic pockets, bitch
My bank account is crazy, bitch
I think it needs some medicine
My straight jacket Givenchy-enchy-enchy
Can't even pronounce that shit
Designer jeans, designer drugs
Just bought me a designer bitch
Why this bitch keep hittin' my line?
She knowin' she ain't no dime and shit
Knowin' I ain't got no time to waste
Be fuckin' around with no nickel bitch
Your nigga pinchin' pennies
But I'm out here making these millions, bitch
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for
Cause I got all the presidents
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie
All day, she think she elegant
It's an elephant in the room
Guess who's the mothafuckin' elephant? (It's Gucci)
Maybach in the garage
Elevator in the residence
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop, yeah)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Me and Guwop, makin' super moves
Makin' stupid cash, stack it through the roof
You don't fuck with me? The feelin' mutual
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru
We hit the city, the old me goin' OC
How a friend only gonna watch that, it's so weak
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats
But I need that, in the sauna, in the bathroom, at your mama's
Like a porn star, I'm a monster, you a dancer, on the camera
In the G-string, girl, I want you, at the concert, at the condo
In my bedroom, in the guestroom
In the restroom, fuck it, every room, tryna see that...

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print



[Intro]
Ha! S'Gucci!
Suckas keep on downing me
They know they should be crowning me
Hahaha! Yo! It's Guwop
Just counting paper (just counting paper)
We're just counting the days, huh

[Verse 1]
80 chains going and ain't took one yet
Ain't nothing retarded 'bout Gucci but this gold Rolex
A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck
I hope you didn't pay them, cause they didn't have no success
You seen my interview, nigga, and you got upset
I seen your interview too, you looked oh so stressed
I think the nigga just mad cause I fucked his ex
And I'm a big dog, he got the lil' boy complex
Go dig your partner up, nigga, bet he can't say shit
And if you looking for the kid, I'll be in Zone 6
I hit a birthday party fresh, you and ya homeboy Tip
I know y'all seen me over there with that black fo' fifth
I bought a Bentley Mulsanne, it look just like Tip’s
But I never went platinum, do you catch my drift?
I never let a nigga do me like Tip did Flip
This the same shit that got Big and 2Pac killed, it's Gucci!

[Interlude]
For the record, this is not a diss record
Just the truth
It's Gucci the living legend
Oh, yeah, I'm a legend
Living legend nigga
Respect that

[Verse 2]
I ain't playing wit ya, I ain't trying to dance wit ya
I ain't using hands, let them rubberbands get ya
It take money to go to war, and we can go to war nigga
I ain't no real rapper, I'm a fucking grave digger
I'm a old school fool, don't make me show my age, nigga
Grab a Louisville and turn it to a batting cage, nigga
I did a song with Keyshia Cole, and I know you still miss her
But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love wit her
Call you to do a song, wouldn't even smoke no bud wit ya
I was screaming so icy, and was a neighborhood nigga
This AR is my back up cause I don't need nann nigga
Must didn't hear when Flocka said, "Let them guns blam nigga!"
Used to drive to Birmingham with a lot of grams nigga
I'm just who I am nigga but I ain't sparing nann nigga
I know it's hard for you to sleep knowin you killed your homeboy
You left his son to be a bastard, won't even raise ya own boy

[Outro]



[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, probly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up, biatch..! This yo' favorite song
Translation: Ven aqui, mami, ese culo
Tu quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me molestes
Pero chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron
Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, sHe gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year
I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smokin' weed and drinkin', all the college students lovin' Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anytHing, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Intro]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

[Hook]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

[Verse 2]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"Fuck police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Hook]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'mma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'mma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place... wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates... break
Every time a bullet detonate... dates... of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

[Hook]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

Wifey gonna kill me, she the female OJ
Y'all don't feel me, man, this ain't okay
Four Seasons, take a shower, new clothes, I'm reloaded
Rich nigga, still eatin' catfish
That bitch ain't really bad, that's a catfish

Have the paparazzi doin' backflips, yeah
If I lay you down on the mattress
Blow the back out 'til you backless

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's impossible to love it, if you don't come from it
It's things that goes on, you just can't stomach
I seen it all happen, but I ain't sayin' (Nada)
Peep, 24/7 in the hood it's hot
If you wanna fall through, get Top on the phone
He don't pick up then it ain't bool
Let you know it ain't good to stop
That part, that part (That part)
I'm a Watts nigga and we not kosher
Shit, niggas only concern is the bottom line like a stockholder
This is where they come, where they cop them boulders
Hoes catfight with their tits exposed
Still sippin' on that Wild Irish Rose
Still rock swap meet designer clothes (Ah!)
Black MAC 11 in my mattress (Woo!)
Make a hundred racks do a backflip (Woo!)
Might go Uncle Luke on them hoes (Ho!)
Pussy pop for a bankroll (Yeah)
All my killers with me got a blank face (Yeah)
On that "Fuck you, bitch, where the pay pay?"
Make 'em pull up on your block with them 223s—aim it at your face, hey
Movin' with the rock and the Glock concealers
You either sellin' rock or you flock to get it
You either on the watch or the clock is tickin'
The life of my Watts and my Bompton niggas
Get pinched, I'ma post a bond
Know P.O.P. gon' hold it down, look
Need cash, gotta get you some
If a hater tell you money ain't everything
He don't want you to get none
So we thuggin' like DMX
Bleed shit, PMS
Point blank, period, meet me on the ES
I'm fully with the BS, believe that!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And we don't stress
A .38 'til it free your chest
Then PP on the PO's desk
I'm Jay-Z in a blow out press
Relate me to your blowout's best
Can't hate me, I'm remote you're deaf
I'm HD, causin' photo theft
My AC antifreeze gotta—that part
Hold your breath, I'm 8 feet when I hold this TEC
Protect me from the local threats
My ID say my eye don't rest
My IV qualify T-rex
Society kept my IQ vexed
Denyin' me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest
The—uh, the awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left, uh

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Me no conversate with the fake—(Hahaha)—that part
All my bitches independent bitches—that part
I just want the paper—that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Zest god, zest god, zest god, zest god
Yamborghini high, cream soda with the Wockhardt
Soulo Ho3 the prophet, yeah, Soulo hold the profit
That's the fortune teller makin' withdrawals and deposits
Ironic, they wanna know where I've been in
Where the fuck I've been hidin' in
When the fuck am I droppin' that
New work that take 'em to church and
Turn the universe upside down again
Since you're so smart
I can't get in my groove 'til we get the Q first
Do what thou will not
Yo, my pool of thought large enough to part the Red Sea
Father forgive 'em for they know not know who they see
I got all eyes on me, call me 3Pac
Soulo

[Interlude: ScHoolboy Q]
Hang on, nigga, let me get some
Hang on, nigga
Hang on

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
Made a mil' and I spent it in the same day (Day)
Got a chopper, not the AK (Ayy)
Gettin' money on a vacay (Hey)
Go go gadget's in the driveway (Driveway)
Groovy Tony in July 8th
Yeah, I'm killin' kitties on a Sunday (Ayy)
How you ballin' in a Hyundai?
My Ferrari got a toupee
Swerve in the big body
Your favorite artist, I'm his big homie
Yeah I'm walkin' with a fifth
And I ain't votin', I'm a Crip, homie (Yeah)
I'm where them Bloods, where them Locs at (Locs at)
Where the blood, where the choke round gloves for the combat (Combat)
How the feds in your contacts?
How the feds know my set name?
Fled in the Mulsanne (Ayy)
Hydrate up the rap game
Heard Soulo comin' up next
And SZA got a classic, nigga
Heard Zay just got it mastered, uh
The fire burnin' through the plastic
So fingers to the badges (badges)
They don't love you 'til the racks evolve
When I was broke they wouldn't accept the call
Now they on me for my decimals
Blank Face has gotta X 'em off
Enemies gotta bob and weave
Gangbangin' like we stand for somethin'
When Alton Sterling gettin' killed for nothin'
Two cowards in the car, they're just there to film
Sayin' BlackLivesMatter should've died with him
Wrong nigga in your hood, you gon' ride on him
White nigga with a badge, you gon' let that slide?
Tell me how they sent that footage off and slept that night
I feel bad that my daughter gotta live this life
I'll die for my daughter, gotta fight this fight
Put a Blank Face on, nigga, let that drop
That—that part

[Verse 1]
Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Hook]
So now we 'bout to break the bank

[Verse 2]
My time to show out, finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Your bitch wanted cash, get her, know I'm around, boy
Tell Kendrick, move from the throne, I came for it
I hope this fuckin' hit arrange for it, cause goddamn
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy

[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with my mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mil' and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me but they should've shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg' on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bank roll (stand on your bank roll)
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say "Que pasa with the pesos?"
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (T.R.U.)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]

100k in my trunk
Keep that bitch with that donk
She gon' pop in them heels
She must heard of my deal
She gon' roll on them pills
Just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq
This that make you climax
This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth,make the loot
Expensive whips, we hotbox
Spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock

I'm suckin' on the clit, she suckin' on the dick
Give that hoe a tip, told her "Buy some kicks"
Then I brush my teeth, pop up in a whip
Glocky in the whip, glocky in the whip
And I'm cocky, fuckin' on a thotty
She just wanna plot me, bitch can't stop me
I'm riding in a Mazi, this ain't even my Mazi
Oh, that's not yo' thottie, yo' bitch look like a aunty
Walked in with Ashanti, damn, that look like Shanti
Damn, that look like Carti, I think dat be Young Carti
Heard he spent a hunnid on a fucking watch piece, that's filthy

[Chorus]
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, then I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block
And I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide in my sock, selling that rerock
What, what, what, what, what
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Use to sell rerock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps, you know what I'm sayin'?

Used to hunnid sack it, now I fuck an actress
Shit, I'm just thinkin' how it happened
Had to get explicit, had to make 'em listen
Moving out them pounds, niggas started snitchin'
Loading up them rounds, niggas started missin'
Move it out of town, and Tommy Cruise the mission
Converse with my addictions, don't talk I just listen
Five drugs that I'm mixin', money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semi's and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits
Like grandma TV, we been with the static
I fuck on this bitch and she say she from Athens
Opiated so I'm demonstratin' my emotion less
Got some real niggas quotin' this, got yo' main bitch hoein shit
Lost a few things as of recent, life is anything but decent
Blow the re-up on my teeth

Shipping a pack and it's vacuum sealed

Strap on my side like a Navy SEAL
Three in the morning, we trapping still
Matte black on rover, the Batmobile
Don’t trust that nigga cause he gon squeal
Not buying shit if the pack not sealed
I'm faded, I’m faded, off xannies I’m wasted
My bitches they nasty, they suck it and taste it
I’m short on my patience, I’m serving my patient
I’m very impatient, little bitch come get naked
Pack coming in but I don’t need to weigh it
Choppa en route, I shoot once and you spraying
Can’t come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Dripping through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot cause she heard me on the radio
3 bitches, one of me, that's a perfect ratio
Don’t wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her booty hole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, backwoods, riding 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to po'
Hit a stain, hogging lanes, gripping grain, getting throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred when you see me, Imma let it go
No mo' 'gars so we rolling up the fronto
No mo 'gars cause we rollin out the fronto
I'm in H-town, nigga, and I can never go

Audi, Bimmer, Benz with the roof up
Still on this goop punch, three gram, boof blunt

Called up some hoes, "Let's go to Lenox Square"
Might just go icey my wrist, might just go cop me some squares
Keep a small circle, I can't fuck with squares
Ay I had to get it how I got it, nigga life ain't fair
Spilt that lean all on my kicks and got another pair
I say fuck them two hoes man, I got another pair, bitch
Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi
Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi

[Bridge]
Why should I keep juggin' all these broke boys?
In the mall buying ice cause he's a broke boi
I can't even kick it with these broke boys
He ain't come to buy a pack cause he a broke boi

[Verse]
Bitch I'm going through the sack cause I'm no broke boi
Runnin' up the check on these broke boys
Put some bands on your neck and have you murked boy
Bitch I'm ballin' on these niggas, ballin'

Don't cross your partner, pussy, that's a pussy for some pussy
Always talked about me, still ain't never shook me
I'm a real nigga from the Flat can't overlook me
1500 nigga if you're tryna come and book me
Niggas gonna fuckin' book me
Keep that choppa on me, my grandma watchin' me
Fuck my Jesus piece, I might squeeze the piece
Hold out on my way, I might flood the streets
And I'm on this lean, I won't make a scene
Nigga front on me, I'mma make a scene
Run up in his shit, run up in his shit

[Hook]
Audi, Bimmer, Benz with the roof up

Diamonds they lookin' like ice, I whip the hoe like I'm Ike

Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a chopper chop you if you try me bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this", that's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being bougie by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks, for the most part
"I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP and I ain't wanna rush

[Hook: Playboi Carti + A$AP Rocky]
Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up

Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play

Leave a nigga neck, what, what (molly!)
Disrespect my set, I got hella checks

Hoe, you not my hoe, get it through yo' head
Only want the neck, what, what
Choppas with a pointer, why you fallin' short
Call in my report, what, what
You call him, I report him, what, what
Audi sit on Forgis, what, what, what
Sit on Forgis

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Your hoe talk too much, I just wanna bust

Fuck a stripper hoe (molly!), I'm like, nigga, for what?

I said that I’mma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I’mma die with my finger on the trigger
I’ve been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain’t goin' in unless I’m with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)

[Verse 1: YG]
First thing's first I love all my niggas
This rap shit cracked and I involve my niggas
You lookin' for some lean, lemme call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all mines nigga
Some niggas smoke smoke, some niggas drink drank
Got niggas on the block with the Glock that don't think
I said, "that's a nigga back up," they in a bucket lapped up
I got to act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch; no, that ain’t my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch; no, that ain’t my nigga
Take a nigga case, yeah that’s my nigga
Know him since I was eight, yeah that’s my nigga
Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick, passed with my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I’m down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Just know I'm down with the niggas down for me

Then we used to hit a mall and buy everything we see
Me and my down ass nigga get twisted
Nigga get to trippin', knock the gravy out your biscuit
Just know I fucked with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I’m like, "Hey, my nigga!"
Drink that act right by the case, my niggas
Drink that act right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty trynna chase them figures
Who got the yopper, who got the yola? Don’t matter, go figure

If a nigga talkin' shit then he ain’t my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)

Shawty seein' me and want to leave with a nigga

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 911
I'm the nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

[Chorus: YG]
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Champagne
Bitch, who do you love?
I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup

[Chorus: YG]
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

[Bridge: YG]

Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block

[Chorus: YG]
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

Bitch, who do you love?

[Outro]
Nigga we straight and we hood
Ain't nobody ever gave us shit
When you see us shinin' it's because we steady grindin'
We stay paper chasin'
Separatin' the real from the fake
The fake from the real
We livin' to die and dyin' to live!
Nigga, that's why we got so many women
I'm tryna go deep, hit them asscheeks
Bust them guts, make her cum
Bitch, you know the game!
Ain't a motherfuckin' thing change!
Bitch! Who do you love!?

[Skit: YG]
Ay, hold up!
I done lost too many homies in these past couple years. This shit brazy!
Rest in peace, my nigga CJ Mack. Rest in peace, my nigga Cedar Block Frog though (Bool!). Rest in peace, my nigga Tiny M. And last but not least, rest in peace, my nigga Big Aaron



[Verse 1: YG]
My bitch drive a all white Range
Couldn't hit it if you niggas had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
You had it then you lost it, Hall of Shame
I can buy a Bentley, don't talk to me
For a show 150, don't talk to me
You ain't never helped your mans, don't talk to me
You just follow all the trends, don't talk to me
Ayy, I set the bar, I'm the fuckin' bar
Look in the sky, I'm a fuckin' star
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard
Do everything like my shirt, extra large
I don't care how I crash a Ghost
Got two cribs in two states, I be doing the most
I got white-folks money that I won't blow
And if you ask why, 'cause the white folks don't

[Chorus: YG]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, this type of money make you stay awake
Type of money, she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Everything proper, no propaganda
Tropicana Goyard bandana
Big sack, a lotta hoes like Santa
Threw a birthday party in a Phantom
Big shit like a dinosaur did it
And you know Tity shinin' like acrylic
Yeah I sold dope, I had cornrows
I can you see niggas hatin' with the door closed
Now I'm lookin' for a glove with the sparkle on it
And my CBD got chocolate on it
Big bank take small-ass shit
Bank account on some tall-ass shit
Attitude on some "Fuck you too"
Bankroll on "What it do, boo?"
Meet me at the room, let's vibe
And if I ain't did it yet, I'll try it

[Chorus: YG, YG & Big Sean]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

[Verse 3: Big Sean, LaBritney]
She said, "Whatchu' gon do if I leave?"
I said, "Bitch, I'ma do me"
B.I.G., bitch everything zoomed in (zoom)
Big bag on me lookin' like I'm movin' in
Got my foot in the door and we still here
I'm a first generation millionaire
I broke the curse in my family not having shit
I'm passionate like girls that's after more than just cash and dick
Feed me to the wolves, now I lead the pack and shit
You boys all cap, I'm more Colin Kaepernick
I'm rare as affordable health care (oh God)
Or going to wealth from welfare (Goddamn)
I turn my W's to M's, yeah, I flip those
I might buy her red bottoms with the crypto
Three coins, that'll pay ya whole semester
But you gotta ride it better than a Tesla

[Chorus: YG & Big Sean]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank (lil' bitch)
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Uh oh!
Back again, back to back, Maybach, stack the Ms
Told em' I met Slim Shady, bagged a Em
Once he go black, he'll be back again
Tell them hoes that it's crunch time, abdomen
Yes, I cop mad Chanel and mad Given'
She did it again, imagine them
'Bout to make these bum bitches mad again
Uh-oh, back to them
I lead the pack so my backs to them
Yep, the queen's back, what's happenin'?
Re-Run, 'bout to make these bitches rap again
Uh, diamond chains on my ankle
Young Money in the cut like a shank though
Tell T.I.P. rubber bands in my bankroll
Show my ass like a stank hoe

[Chorus: YG]
Big bank take lil' bank
Big bank take lil' bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank



[Verse 1: YG]
I'm talkin 'bout puttin' on, ridin' out, Glocks in my ma's house
Front you with that work (I done fronted niggas work, uh-oh!)
You say you want that head up, but we don't fight fair bruh
Catch you slippin' from your backside, then knock you out
Ace gone stomp you out, then Buddah gon' stomp you out
(Has mama ever seen you with a busted eye and busted mouth?)
Nine milli pokin' out, four-fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days, show you what this West Coast about

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas, vice versa
Eyes red from the kush I blew, white person
Got my middle finger on the trigger
And with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Tunechi!

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & Lil Wayne]
I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger

My nigga, my nigga (My motherfuckin' niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Ohh! I done spent a million dollars on my motherfuckin' niggas
You catch me out Chicago with them motherfuckin' hittas
Call up RondoNumbaNine, Lil Durk'll bring the trigger (ay, Durk!)
And when we on that lean, we ain't fuckin' with the liquor
I'm a buy a hundred bottles just to give it to the bitches
She keep liking all my pictures
Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and neck be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have em screamin' “Caine get up"
Same nigga from the bottom, ain't a damn thing change
Catch me out in Collins screamin', "Money ain't a thang"
In a red Mulsanne, lookin' like I claim Blood
And if homie ain't my homie then I know it ain't love
Screamin' out "4 Hunnid,” YG that's my nigga
Cause I been in the field life on the line with him
And if it's really good, why I prolly die with em
Cause when I need the choppers, I just tell Tak hit 'em

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & Lil Wayne]
I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I just got 250 thousand dollars for a verse, nigga
I don't know, is it me or it's your thirst, nigga?
You nig, you niggas ain't got no joints
Like a injured Chris Paul, you ain't got no point
I just come through with a couple bossy bitches
They get money too, they some "don't cross me" bitches
Flossy bitches, Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game then it's floor seat, bitches!
I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu fries apple pies other bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches
Bitches, my bitches
I need a nigga with some different strokes, Todd Bridges
Shout out to my main bitches and my side bitches
Need a nigga with some good neck, ostriches
My niggas

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & Lil Wayne]
I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]

Give me space, we might rob the shit
Most hate it, baby they don't love the clique
I thought they love you when you make it
This some other shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah, this some other shit
Friends and business don't mix so I'm brotherless
Tryna get back close, hit 'em with the stiff
Gears I shift, make sure they feel the drift
Just copped the Benzo with the tint
You should know cause in every song I said this shit
Yeah, in every song I said this shit
I'm just, I'm just proud of my accomplishments
I'm a 4Hunnid nigga, I don't care at all
Have her suck dick, lick the head and all
Heard you talkin' 'bout I'm real, I'm fraud
Your kids and broad, they straight, you shouldn't care at all

If you ain't know me, bet you know now
Drizzy came through with the verse for me both times
Bomp-town that's an automatic hold down
What's that? Ask no questions, just hold it down
Why you hatin' on the progress?
I'm a humble nigga, I don't even pop shit
What I do?
I just drive the Maybach through the projects
And Still Brazy ain't even drop yet
Hate from a distance, please don't try me
Cause we'll turn it up on anybody

I'm just bicken back being bool

I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
Pull up on the block, like, "What!"
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA; I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'; homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man, this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news, so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool

Bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 2]
Verse two, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down them guns come out
Click clack, bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas
That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin', bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county, I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios

[Interlude]
Aye, nigga, nigga, nigga
I got a whole zone right now
Like, right now, right now
Like, what you tryin' to do right now?

Bicken back, bicken back being bool

But what she wearing? Chanel and Dolce
How she want it? Beat up like O.J
Skurt, skurt on a bitch nigga
How much time do you got for a rich nigga?
I need action while I'm relaxin' and the bitch knows gymnastics
So she can divide her legs on this dick like a fraction, right?
Right, left, hit 'em with that right, left
I got that best stroker, I don't need no pipe test
My dick work girl I don't need no mic check
No panties on, I can see your pussy through that white dress
I ain't trippin' baby girl, make that money
Cause if I fuck her right she just might give some to me
And better yet, fuck with me for better sex
I know all the right spots to keep that punani wet

[Pre-Hook: YG]

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm a Pisces, she's a Taurus
She said she expensive, well, I could afford it
Never pay for it, but I could explore it
Have your tongue out and legs cocked open like Jordan
She just wanna strip and make a million right?
So she could get rich and feed the children right?
She ain't got no ass shots her shit real, yo
Got her checkin' in with me like I was a P.O
I hate make-up, I hate broke hoes
I can’t talk to you bitch, I ain’t social
Where the bad bitches at? Let me know though
I can send this dick your way baby, postal
Is it Brittany or Myeshia?
Where the ghetto bitches at? Queesha and Syeeda?
She dancin' for them dollars cause she don't know no better
She from the hood so she know how to throw it back better

[Pre-Hook: YG]
Girl you know you look fine as hell, right?
You know I buy you that Chanel, right?

YG: Shit, I think, like, beven o'block! Aww shit, it's my nigga Ricky Heaven. This nigga, every time, this old-ass nigga...
RICKY: Shit-talking, when I hit the hood, them dogs bark. Narcs stalking. Blasting on them bustas, got yo baby mama twerking, soo-WOO! Live from the 4, close yo eyes!
MAN #1: Aww, man, who the fuck?
[gunshots]



[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm drunk off Hennessy, hope I don't run into my enemies
That dark liquor give you energy
Now I ain't rich, but I'm finna be
Your baby mama's a flip, she wanna hit a G
(Ahhh shit!) I'm back on that bool shit
But she ain't fuckin' and that's bullshit
I can't die, I got too much to live for
I'm getting money, that's what niggas rob and kill for
Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha she gon' whoop her ass
All my homies gangbangers
They dry their clothes on hangers
All these hoes fuckin', but they don't wanna seem like a ho
So you gotta hit 'em on the low (hit em' on the D-Low!)
West side, get money gang
Socked the mouth for trippin', he lost his watch and earrings

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm from Hoover Street, dirty pictures in my cellphone
On 52nd Street I'm well-known
Hoover stomp until the cops come
Silver satan get the job done
Money ain't everything, but still I'm rich
Money ain't everything, I'm still gon' crip
From Figueroa to Harv Side where we sock on lips
We break on jaws, niggas since VCR's, nigga
We hop out cars, nigga
I be groovin' 'til I die, smokin' weed until I'm fried
I could sell a key to God
Pants saggin' with the Glock, I ain't wanna pick the box, uh
All my homies gangbangers
We keep a thumb between our two fingers
We trippin' off the Henny
So don't let me catch you slippin' in the 50's, Ricky

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Nigga, I'm from Bounty Hunters, East Side lunatic
Gang bang, slap a bitch, I ain't with the extras
I ain't got a stunt double
You ain't got no hands so they might let the gun touch you
Is you bangin' or you ballin', nigga?
You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life?
Bet that on the ten or four, nigga!
She bouncing that ass, go 'head, shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches'll fake it
You fightin' and savin' these hoes, know that you losin'
These bitches the reason why some niggas be snoozin'
YG, dawg, you heard how they left his brains hanging?
Shouldn't have chucked his fingers up if he ain't banging
I'm sayin'...

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody

[Outro]
But I'll beat the fuck out of a bitch
Why you bullshitting?

400, Spruce Street
(What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?)
(What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?)
Nigga, kill off all beef

[Verse 1]
I’m a Westside get brackin' in the back like what’s happnin'
That 40 Glock snap like Insta, ain't no need for a caption
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it
'Hamad threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect
That's how I got put on
Tree Top Bompton, yeah I got put on
It was hard in the hood
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood
I know Game from cedar block, Dot from the West
That was [static] that popped what's his name in his chest
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on
Niggas gotta go, we can't prolong

[Hook]
Nigga, I'm from BPT

(What block? What block? What block? What block?)
400, Spruce Street
(What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?)
(What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?)
Nigga, kill off all beef

[Verse 2]
I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'
Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence
That's a principal of proof, the definition of logic
That this nigga is a bitch, every chance he get he's dodgin'
I brought back this West Coast shit
And this the mothafuckin' thanks I get?
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit
They brought him more cases in jail but a nigga ain't snitch
That's how it's s'posed to go down
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down
Give you a blind date, have my bitch pick you up
Then have one of my Top members stick you up
I know Nipsey from 6-0, C-Hood from 10-4
Tiny Bone from 40 Crip, that’s my kinfolk
My whole family tried to save me but it didn't work
Momma know I've been bangin' lately, nigga



[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Hold up, bitches simmer down
Takin' hella long, bitch, give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a 9
Ooh, baby like it raw with the shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, A$AP, get like me
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome, make you sweat like Keith
‘Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Gettin' figures and fuckin' bitches
She rollin' Swishers, brought her bitches
I brought my niggas, they gettin' bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act nigga-ish
But least a nigga nigga rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fuckin' boys; beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem

And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Ah, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o' clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach, I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer-park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck?
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothin' but a buckshot, ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin'  Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B. B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That were no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag,poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist



[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off



[Verse 1]
Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimping hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
Going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Verse 2]
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy

[Hook]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

[Verse 3]
It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids

[Verse 4]
Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin Three-Stack, it’s a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we going

[Hook]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

[Verse 1]
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

[Hook]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)
Cause every day we on our pesos

[Verse 2]
Your bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

[Hook]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)
Cause every day we on our pesos



[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 1]
Rocking, rolling, swagging to the max
My bitch a fashion killa, she be busy popping tags
She got a lotta Prada, that Dolce and Gabbana
I can't forget Escada, and that Balenciaga
I'm sipping purple syrup, come be my Aunt Jemima
And if you is a rider, we'll go shopping like mañana
Her attitude Rihanna, she get it from her mama
She jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana
Cause everything designer, her jeans is Helmut Lang
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna
Karan, wearing all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultiers cause they match with her persona

Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga

[Verse 2]
I see your Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples
Costume National, your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk, her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down, bossy see how I ride 'round
Mami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that means she shop 'til she drop
And Versace: got a lot, but she may never wear it
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents

[Hook]
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"

[Bridge]
Scoop back tees, breeze in coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags and links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out

[Hook]
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"

[Chorus: Rod Stewart + Miguel]
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye, prolly goin' ballistic, but listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (yeah) and he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holla if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart + Miguel]
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Chorus: Miguel + Rod Stewart]
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow



[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD



[Verse 1]
Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

[Hook]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

[Verse 2]
I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' but they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

[Hook]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye



[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
Sit down (hol’ up, lil', hol’ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil’, sit down, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

[Verse 2]
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!

[Chorus]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Aye, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

[Chorus]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!—

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

[Outro]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick & his conscience]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Bridge]
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Break]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

All the girls wanna play Baywatch

[Interlude: (Sherane)]
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Skit/Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?
L----, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!



[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (soldier’s DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon’ plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the maker of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'

[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!

I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

New Kung Fu Kenny

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—

[Break: Kendrick Lamar]
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again — oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar—

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S.

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S.

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S.

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Outro Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for.
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Aw yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (oh yeah)

[Chorus 2]
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'—{Gunshot}
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—{Gunshot}
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premiere!)
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin’ lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me

I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Love me

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net-worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I’d rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, I got somethin'
Hol' up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I’m with it
Only for the night, I’m kiddin'
Only for life, yeah, only for life, yeah
Only for life, let’s get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what's comin' over me
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, all money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won’t end

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net-worth, would you still love me?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today (love me)
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net-worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me

[Verse 1]
Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurkin', don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start bustin'
Put that on my Yankee hat, I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shootin' in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a creole
T-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know

[Hook]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flippin'
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Knowin' change gon' come like Obama and them say
But they shootin' everyday 'round my mama and them way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Crippin' where I'm livin', come and follow me
Pistol poppin', Poppy Street (Poppy Street)

[Hook]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

[Verse 3]
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga
Who you murdered? You ain't heard of Coldchain
Best thang, smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty runnin' Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Frontin' with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from street, they a nigga best, yes
'Cept for Little Halftime, Brody bangin' five blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Crippin', Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop block the corner
Givin' hell 'til it's frozen over, I ain't never ran from nothin'

[Hook]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Fuck ya dead homies, run ya bread homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Bimmer bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit
Livin' for that True Religion is broke shit
I can spend that on a MAC with a long clip
Fly in that Benz but you hide in that Focus
My nigga just focus, I'm tryin' to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner gets stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to domin'
That's somebody's son but a war to be won
Baby either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket, he called me a crab
So I shot at him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
What means the world to you?
Is it a fast life, money and clothes?
Probably fuckin' these hoes
Or what would you murder for?
Will your name hold weight when the curtains close?
Nigga caught one case and I heard he told
Snitch get a full clip and closed casket
Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shootin', no practice
Been tourin', whip foreign, coupe crashin'
Still bangin' 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still "fuck the police" they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard, 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clappin'
Kids crying, still snipe him, no lackin'

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
I don’t have a reason, oh but I
I'll get in your mind
I keep you loaded and ready right here beside of me
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on your mind
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on your mind
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on your mind



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all don't want money, y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die and embrace the thing
Trapped inside a burnin' church
Made it out alive, God know my worth
Raw face, Scarface
Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em, 20 on call
Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you then fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Hey hey, ready, set, go crazy
Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines
A life hit a nigga with a lemon's limelight
But at night, we still committin' crimes, spittin' rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city full of sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimmin' in the debt
Don't drown on ground, wait until you hear
9-1-1, freeze (zoom, zoom) dead

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)

[Verse 3: Yugen Blakrok]
I move like a millipede
When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep*
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colors in my aura tend cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Roll over your eyes
My strength ain't nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my cords like a weaver

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)



[Chorus]
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

[Verse 1]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been known this
Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us
Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers
Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers
Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now
Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too
L-B-P-D get sprayed on too
Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof
Blowing 40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy
Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios

[Chorus]
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

[Verse 2]
Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been known that
Blowing on dicks for spliffs and cold Cognac
Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's
Where the coke at? Love white like Bobby wife
Finna party like it's prom tonight
Finna kill a nigga walkin' to his mom’s tonight
Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal
Best deal that the judge finna offer: life
Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison
And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life
Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night
Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches
Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden
Nigga, fuck that

[Chorus]
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

[Outro]
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em

Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night?
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the plug right?
Got your head right? Boy, yeah right

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Pretty woman wanna slit the wrist
Pretty woman wanna be a rich man's bitch
Pretty women want a couple kids
Pretty women want a new ass, new lips
Pretty women wanna push a Benz
Come correct and she won't let you in
Thumbin' through a check, she gets it in
Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend?

[Chorus: Vince Staples]
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

[Bridge: Kućka]
Got an enemy that changes dependin' what direction
You're facin'
Got an enemy that tells you what block and what division
You're placed in
You pretend to get a better idea about the lifestyle
You're chasin'
Keep pretendin', make it real until every cell replaced, erased

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Pop 'til it's vacant
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand  my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like "deadass"
L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
I said, nigga, yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
My life, hiii life, high five, bye, bye

[Chorus: Vince Staples]
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

You can get anything you want
Know what I'm saying?
You want that over there?
You want that over there?
I got you

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I was up late night balling
So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down do Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, god damn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie
Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz
Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click, clack, clap
Or the boop, bop, bam, cuz

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
It's funny I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread
From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm just a nigga until I fill my pockets
And then I'm Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin'
I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters
So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference?
My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin' on blue-waters
Was fadin' up in Davis, then walkin' back to Palmer
A fro like Huey partner, Auntie Angie had them choppers
So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference?
I feel like "Fuck Versace", they rapin' nigga's pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, if Moses look like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aimin' at Nirvana
My bitch look like Madonna, they starin' at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should have brought the chopper
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he lookin' at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

[Hook]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

[Verse 2]
We love our neighborhood, so all my brothers bang the hood
I never vote for presidents, the presidents that change the hood
Is dead and green, was standin' on this mezzanine in Paris, France
Finna spaz cause most my homies never finna get this chance
All these white folks chanting when I asked 'em where my niggas at?
Goin' crazy, got me goin' crazy, I can't get wit' that
Wonder if they know, I know they won't go where we kick it at
Ho, this shit ain't Gryffindor, we really killin', kickin' doors
Fight between my conscience, and the skin that's on my body
Man, I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari
Man, I breathe in, bleed this Poppy Street
I shot them guns cause talk is cheap
Bow your head and pray, okay, now walk wit' me

[Hook]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
(Lift me up, lift me lift me up, lift me lift me up, lift me lift me lift me up)

[Hook]
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes and tell me whatcha thinkin'
Open up your mind, and tell me whatcha seein'
Inside of me, why we fussin', fuckin' up this evenin'
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meanin'
What's the grudge that you're holdin'?
Hold my hand let me take you to the land
Where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart, if we don't love then we fall apart

[Chorus]
This could be forever, baby
I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall
Soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm
Don't make me regret it, baby

[Bridge]
Cause if I never knew ya, I could never do this to ya
Hope you understand, they never taught me how to be a man
Only how to be a shooter, I only need the time to prove it

[Hook]
Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

[Verse 2]
My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missin' you
I'm searchin' for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid
And people left alone
Pick up the phone
Don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world



[Verse 1]
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
"Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!"
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

[Chorus]
Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

[Verse 2]
As a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand
Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man
Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans
Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

[Chorus]
Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
No, No, No, No
Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

[Chorus]
Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back



[Verse 1]
This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin is black as midnight
I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz
I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven, as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now
Cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie
How dare you think it's different
Boy, you trippin'

[Hook]
Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie

[Verse 2]
Boy I'm buoyant, we are
Floating on them peons
Go in 'til they take my bro'nem out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects
So 'til they love my dark skin
Bitch I'm goin' all in

[Hook]
Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie

[Interlude]
They found it
Depth close to 3,230 feet
A deep dive, but within acceptable range

[Verse 3]
Clap your hands if the police ever profiled
You ain't gotta worry, don't be scary 'cause we on now
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
We on now



[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up”, let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die during sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimming
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Prick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleeping with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinking deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said: “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?”
Or “Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?”
Or “Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame?

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
(Why?)

[Bridge: Joba]
Everything I have
(Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand
(Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense
(To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again
(Tryna figure it out)
I'm tryna figure it out
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

[Outro: bearface]
Everything you wear
I'll be the one to care
Softly raise your hair
All the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)



[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the clone
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (Haha)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (Yum!)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh)
Whatchu mean, it ain't working? (What?)
Whatchu mean, you ain't finding yourself? (Oh, I am, I'm trying)
Whatchu mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit)
Whatchu mean? Whatchu mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (Uh-huh!)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess?)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (No)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (Eh)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say "ugh!", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Don't call me stupid, that ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid, I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston, tryna see if Beyoncé' will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs, a civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man, everywhere I go is the Woodlands
I need a honeybutter, vodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger, all the kids know who I am
I need a honeybutter, puttin' lean in my Sprite can

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me they run
On 37th, used to run from the bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name, led to Hollywood
I was living off Ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit



[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I might go Interstellar
I feel like Matthew McConaughey
I don't care for what they gotta say
Tony Perkis how I drop the weight
Jason Bourne with the headshot
Jason Statham with the whip game
Liam Neeson with the rescue
I go Gunnar with the leather face
Bruce Campbell with the chains
Tobin Bell with the saw
Anthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw
They don't know who we are
Molly Shannon I'm a superstar
Ride or die like it's Seabiscuit
Tryna stack like Tobey
John Wick, I don't leave a witness
Chris Paul, I'm assistin'
Ameer go Blake Griffin
Give me forty-eight minutes
We go '04 Pistons
Catch a fade like Robert Horry
Only time to get the spotlight
Deray how I'm top flight
Go Obama when I drop mics

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm the black Tom Hanks
You can call me Nigga Banks
Secret Agent Cody Banks
Quarter pound of the dank
On the scale and it stank
Put my mama in a Range
I just bought a new Wraith
Nic Cage with the face off
John Travolta when I take off
Brad Pitt, start a fight club
Turn the trap into the nightclub
I'm like Prince with the white doves
Paint a picture with the white dust
Lionel Ritchie with the white bitch
Try to tell it to her nicely but she never wanna listen
Beat the pussy to submission
Tom Cruise on a mission
Pull a R&B singer, bring her back to South Central
I shine just like a popstar, MJ my initial
Kobe Bryant with the spin moves
If these niggas got issues
H-Town with Beyoncé, turn her to my prom date
Kingpin like JAY-Z, dance moves like JT

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Heath Ledger with some dreads
I just gave my nigga head
Standing on my two legs
Fuck what that nigga done said
Bruh, I don't fuck with no white boys
'less the nigga Shawn Mendes
I been off and I been dead
Bad as hell, I don't bench press
High school they ain't fuck with me
Now the critics don't fuck with me
My own fam ain't fuck with me
But Viceland did fuck with me
I'm the only popstar with no money
Can't drive, so I'm still running
Uber takin' all my show money
But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight, I get seasick
Did ya see all the art that we did?
Did all that shit in a weekend
We was up all late tweakin', yeah
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday
Michael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday
Rockin' Leo's blood diamonds
Sucked off on the highway
Police right behind me like a nigga stole his OJ
Okay, I don't play, got the same last name as O.J.



[Video Intro: Robert Ontenient]
Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off and
And my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

[Bridge: Ameer Vann]
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
(Go 'head now!)
I got my hand on an ounce, so now I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
(Go 'head now!)
I took an eighth of them shrooms and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
(Go 'head now!)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer, (Merlyn, Merlyn!) hot bars in the summer
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (Again)
When I cut that feel, I do nothing but diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a Lana

[Bridge: Matt Champion & Joba]
Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling wondering why
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk, that want a lady, like
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like— ("just the tip")
And yeah you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, "Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin'
I'm on a mission, every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'



[Intro: Joba]
Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well, well

[Verse 1: Joba]
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Sun sets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in transforming

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-sil
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, uh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two litre, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aw
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft shell tacos
Right now, it's panties and ramen noodles
Now I see how I'm gon' make a shooter
Stamina, stamina!
I used to be holding the camera
Head through the glass, throw your window up
Start praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang but I feel like Santana
She's lightskin just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano...
Made her my wife-a
She can't eat 'cause she's so Bella
Confused erection
Bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to



[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like Ruth, man
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like the shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, guess I'm the shit

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]
Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Damn, damn, I'm frosty
Blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camo, I'm drowning
But you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's
Hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me
Punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin'
Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin'
Honda-swervin', book learnin'
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zorro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters 'cause this ice
Might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Outro: Joba]
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
I keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
Keep a gold chain (I said I keep a, gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (I keep a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (cause then I keep a)
(I said I keep a gold chain, a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain
(I said I keep a, I keep a)
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Cash don't mean shit (shit), cried my last tears, bitch
Cashed my last check (check), cash don't mean shit (shit)
Cash don't mean shit (shit), cried my last tears, bitch
Cashed my last check (check), cash don't mean shit (shit)

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Call me King of the Niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said, "Let there be light" on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, "Get out the way"
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter"
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

[Outro: Kevin Abstract & JOBA]
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what? Y-yo



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (my nigga)
Keep 'em right there, oh, you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I want a love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay when it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin' where you went through the chop
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to shed
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted, to recognize who is there, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the wrong side of the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooo-ooo), ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
And I will show you off for everything I own
I know it's not what you're used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the wrong side of the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooo-ooo), ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real ass bitch
A real ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? (grow it like a real-)
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?  (grow it like a real-)
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real ass bitch  (grow it like a real-)

Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection, mm

Been a wrong, you can change the song, hun

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, come get it from me, uh

Realign the spine, fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters

[Verse 6: Merlyn Wood]
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy

[Verse 7: Dom McLennon]
They be like "what the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the pharaoh when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that's zoom if you just assume

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Video Outro: Dom McLennon]



[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for ya
I'm taking a stand for ya, I care for ya

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What's your motive with me baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head
'Cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect
Sometimes I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
What you waiting for?

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (you need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you come)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sun rise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about
Love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed
I wake up in a cold sweat

[Verse 4: Joba]
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, do you? mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you-u-u, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
What you waiting for?



[Intro: Ronny J]
Ronny J, listen up

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (god damn)

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
Bitch, I'm ultimate, ultimate
Bitch, I'm...

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (damn)

[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, "Is he fake? Is he real?"
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates



[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Verse 1]
I don't even know what to feel, they don't even know what's real
Dry tears with a dollar bill, I'm out tryna make a mill', oh
Why you wanna take my soul? I'm yelling out "hell no!"
I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes
Watch these hoes when they say they want a lot of me
I don't know who's the one that wanna plot on me
I stay low so my demons don't acknowledge me
When I go, I know death don't do apologies

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I felt (ayy)

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Verse 2]
Know when it rains, it pours
They wanna go to war
For things that they can't afford
I gotta grab the sword, preach
I gotta thank the Lord, I gotta go record (heat)
I wanna be fly to soar 'cause niggas be trying to floor me
People be thinkin' that I won the lottery
So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me
Out of nowhere try to fight you
I'm feeling like Raichu 'cause everything shocking to me
Gotta beware of the wicked, the time will be ticking
Them niggas still clocking on me
Lord is my witness, I handle my business
You niggas ain't never ball blocking on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella base, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Outro]
Clout Cobain, yeah
Clout Cobain, yeah



[Verse 1]
This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, Cut the copperhead
Hollow-tips point at a copper head
Drop a head Popping the Glock till the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Boy, your whole life is a mockery
A militant mind of the million
Civilian, I am the realest bitch
No Gilligan put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier (WOOF)
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating common denominator
Aftermath you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely
The same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga

[Chorus]
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)

[Verse 2]
Mystical miracle, I build imperial
I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be off to the clinical
Now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical
Serve, fuck the cops they the opposition
And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant, they got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other
Don't know, where the fuck they came from
We the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
Better get caught with it than without it if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I
Put them on paper, send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise up black fists as black as the raiders
Arming the gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian we the nation of U.L.T
True to you so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga

[Chorus]
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'mma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)

That's what a nigga get being P.I.E
Sweet, nigga you D.I.E

Deep, no tender, no love, no care
But a nigga here still gon' creep

Eye, kill a nigga, get ghost, that
Patrick Swayze, come equipped with a vest
I'mma point that shit to your motherfucking neck
K's all in my trunk
So you best to get a chopper
It's nothing but goon action

[Verse 2: Yung Simmie]
Never take kind to the threats
I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie
Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me?
Whole bunch of green in my Philly, turn up
Whole bunch of niggas if you run up
Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up
Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed
That's a one up, I'm a young gutta
Dog I mutter, Curry said cut ‘em with his brudda
Leave them boys wet like water
Off with his neck, posted with the set
I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats
Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I’m good
Bust a nigga head for the cake
Jumping over gates can't wait
Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe

[Hook: Denzel Curry & Robb Bank$]
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nigga we don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nah we don't take kindly to threats

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
Savage life nigga
You don't wanna see me live
Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe", man
I know your bitch love me
I know your bitch want me
She let me pillow pet that kitty
When she climb under this Snuggie
Bitch, South Florida
I only smoke mid in Broward
But end the flame of that Magic Dragon
And kill that Charmander, bitch
Gone on you niggas
Two phones on you niggas
Think I made it?
You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch

[Hook: Denzel Curry & Robb Bank$]
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nigga we don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats

[Verse 6: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Princess Peach jewelry'ed my bitch

Beep-boop-beep, Go gadget my wrist

Replay it
Let me hear it, let me hear it



[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Verse 1]
I'm a gook!
If I told you that I wasn't then
A nigga wouldn't be telling you the truth
Back in high school, I admit I was a goon
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me, Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga that ain't nothing new
Yeah I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too
Yeah I'm a gook, looking like that nigga Buu
Cut me off, I'm at the booth
Bitch, uh!

[Chorus]
Jabbie told me we gon blow like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

[Verse 2]
Loose, with a screw, loose from the Tre Deuce, smoking boof
Bitch, I always knew, that I was a gook
But how this gook, ended up surpassing you?
Why you looking confused?
Made a hard album so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you threatz, ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that’s on the set
Fucking with me I will put you to rest
Lie and you’ll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!

[Chorus]
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

[Outro]
From the days, I've seen thus far
People tell me that I gook on the daily
One day, I'm gon' be a star
I don't give a fuck if you're gonna hate me
New chains and brand new cars
People tell me that it's all gonna change me
But for now, my mind's on mars
'Cause you know a nigga gook on the daily



[Chorus]
Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion show, my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 1]
Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

[Chorus]
Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion show, my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 2]
She told me that I wasn't losing her, that she losing me
L-O-V, -E, we outta gas, I'll see you in a week
Thinking that, you won't fornicate with niggas that you meet
But silly me, now we are the same, Cupid admit defeat
Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine
You were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died
Idolized you when I didn’t unite
You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now

[Chorus]
You didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion show, my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die
You down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Outro]
Me-e- ayee
She is a side to me
She is a side to me
But you are designed for me-
You're designed for me
But you are designed for me-
You're designed for me

[Intro: Rick Ross, Denzel Curry]
It's history right here (Tote a 4 and pour some liq')
Wassup my nigga? (I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen)
It's time to empower these niggas mane, do it for the city (This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live)
We got to give it to them raw though, ya feel me? (Knotty headed niggas)

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
But they got jacked like MK4
Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime

[Pre-Hook: Denzel Curry]
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party
Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy
My pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz
Rico's Story when I see the coppers
Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition we made obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday, all of you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace

[Pre-Hook: Denzel Curry]
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
Found another body in the lake
Same day another tattoo on his face
Obituary on his mother’s fireplace
Baby mother fuck another sucker on a blind date
Shots fired every night I’m tryna mind mine
Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline
Pussy niggas you can see it on his timeline
Hatin' on his dawg, shit I’m tryna find mine
Calm nigga, when I’m lit up I get Von Miller
Rich niggas if you real then you can run with us
Educated reading books I’m talkin Art of War
Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors
I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes
Came to put my city on that’s if I’m right or wrong
Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars
And I’m thinking of my dawgs since I’m livin wrong
Jehovah’s witness swear to God I done seen it all
Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark
You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off
D.C.C.C. we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Curry what’s up! Double M
It’s futuristic shit

Heard you fuck with swine? (Uh-huh) that ain't my kind
Fuck who you run to, keep it tucked, you know my chopper shy
When it cries, it cries, if you die, you die, pussy, meet the sky

Know my presence makes you bitter, bitch, you better be cautious
It's nasty

I feel the pain, feel the rain
'Cause, bitch, I want revenge

'Cause, bitch, I want revenge

'Cause, bitch, I want revenge (hold on!)

[Verse 3: ZillaKami]
Put your black ass in a duffle bag
And slide off in the hopes, it's a closed casket
My presence alone can exterminate masses
The tongue speak spells, cause blazing rashes
Like who gonna go and betray the beast?
Like who gonna go and start war with me?
Nigga, who gonna go and betray the Zii?
Godzilla (wardogs!), go start a feast
It's the wardog, sup (wassup)
Five-star general, ten-hut (wassup)
In the bottom of hell I, clutch (wassup)
Hands covered in blood and, rust (wassup)
No nigga can take my, soul (wassup)
Drop dead, them heads will, roll (wassup)

I've been out in Bed-Stuy, chilling with my feet up
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us
When I say us, bet, I don't mean no fucking crew
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes & Goofy Troop
Catch me out in Barksdale, counting fettuccine
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville, strapped with a Kimber
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder
Now I'm at the White House, looking for your President
Hop out the van pointing guns at your residence
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now, showing y'all a body
Hoping that you pussy ass *snare* try and find me
Chains on my body, looking like a rapper
Acting like a slave when I’m gunning for my masters, nigga

[Break]
Fuck these niggas!
Buck these niggas!

[Verse 2]
It’s ironic you pressed for a cooking
It’s ironic you talk jail time
But you ain’t never seen no central booking (yeah)
It’s ironic you hang with a nigga that beat women
And have the nerve to call yourself "Girl Pusher" Wow!
You ain’t real, I’m gonna show you how I really feel
White boy better put his hands up, I’m ready
And I’m getting Wilder, shoutout to Deontay
Country niggas booming Peggy, I’m the new Beyoncé
Devil on my entrée, cut like Dante
Promise I will never go blonde like Ka- (hold up!)
Promise I will never go blonde like Kanye?!
Got so many styles, they should call me Peggy A.J
When I hit the stage, niggas know it’s a payday
Tell your bitch, come here, like I work for Midway, nigga!
(Fuck!)

Racks make you walk wop-sided
And you know I rock real diamond
You ain’t even gotta look at them

[Outro]

Feel the dab in my chest, this is venting

Bitch, keep that shit on the net, I treat your (???) like Rafiki
I raise the K like a kid, AR built like Lena Dunham
When I shoot, I don't miss (Trapaholics–!)
Crackers be singing like chorus, choppa be changing they pitch
Choppa pay a nigga a rent, choppa write a nigga hits
Heard he wanna be a rapper, choppa change a nigga niche
Niggas always wanna get buck 'till they meet 50 Cent
Fuck a subtweet, Sub-Pop niggas heads off like pez
Alt-right want war, well that's fine then
Bitch niggas in the way, well that's common
White boys getting mad cause of my content
Y'all brave on the web, keep it in the comments
Sock it to a nigga like Mankind
And motherfuck that flag nigga, we dying

All I need is rest (Help)
I am uncontested, how can I confess this?
Watch how I finesse (About a hundred bands)
How you so invested, this can't be your best
'Cause, I am not impressed (Baby, I must have fucking stanned)
Bullets through my body, I'm a different shawty

She got bandits (nah), I'm kinda passive (Right, young)
Young Rich Swann, we gon' cash in (We gon' cash in)
Dust off the ratchets (Ratchet, ratchet)
We got some action (They got some ratch--)
I'm on the main line, I'm tryna catch 'em (Oh! Okay!)

[Break]
Look, I wish, I wish a nigga would, man
Look, I wish a nigga would try to test me
I wish a nigga would go against me

Fuck around, end up on a backstreet
And I done cried so many times
Look, man

[Verse 3]
I wish, whooosh
I wish a nigga would try to test me
I wish a nigga would go get me
I'm a thug, I don't play with no rap beef
Fuck around, end up on backstreet
And I done cried so many times
I done did so many crimes (Don't kill me)
No time, y'all gassed up for the new line, ugh
I'll make a nigga cry at his own pad
I'll make a nigga cry for his dead dad
I'll make a nigga cry for his fat wife
I'll make a nigga cry for...
I'll make a nigga cry for help
I'll make a nigga cry for himself (THUG TEARS!!)

[Intro: Freaky]
(THIS IS A CERTIFIED HOOD CLASSIC)
Aye, aye, aye
Ay Dios mío!
Aye, aye, aye
Ay Dios mío!
Ay Dios mío!
Ay Dios mío!

[Verse 1: Freaky]
I might vote for Donald Trump, just to say I did it
I might blindly fall into a group of friends full of bigots (REAL TRAP SHIT) Y'all don't know my aiming
I got a vision like That's So Raven (damn)
Gangstas don't die, they get fat and move to Miami
I AM HE, throw it my way, INT
Everything straight like ironed T's
In the back of the Bell burning my degree (LLAMA)
At Uni Mart yelling, "Fuck Bernie"
Up early, cup dirty, couple thirties
Boy the way that Sprite, mix with the lean so purrty
Shit, my tolerance is no mercy (damn)
I just popped 20 xan's so the crackers wouldn't find them
Back up to the wall though drugs like "Where's Waldo?"
Wrote it down, Gonzo knows see I chanchó mano a mano
Damn bro, de plano (aye, aye) ferragamo llama sittin' on chanclas
Deuce feed a Fanta or Mylanta (DAMN SON WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?)
I just might vote for Donald Trump just cause it's legal (adios mio)

[Instrumental Break: Donald Trump and JPEGMAFIA]
"-We have gang, gangs, their coming in from all over-"
(yeah, yo)
"-and as we've said before, we are going to make our country better than ever before, we have that chance!"
(You...you think you know me...)

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
I might vote for Donald Trump just to say I did it (damn, Peggy)
I might call the IRS, pay them a visit (damn, Peggy)
Feed all my niggas with pistols and privilege them digits (adios mios, Peggy)
Then I tell that nigga Chris Christie to pay me a visit
I brought the guns to the house, I got my feet on the couch
I don't think y'all understand but I'm tryna bring back the south (DAMN SON)
I've been the man for a year (what else?)
You've been a bitch all your life (what happened?)
I got my hand on the crown, yeah, voted for that nigga twice (two times)
Braindead on my birthday, I voted for that nigga high (high)
Fuck a Jordan and a Huckabee (fuck 'em), I never wanted the mic (yo)
I never wanted this life (yo), I got a hit for your signs (I do)
My niggas been rollin the dice and now I'm
Shanking these crackers for ice (SHANK 'EM UP!)
I think that I'm over Edge, Spear in a christian
Got all these Lita's, they giving me head
Fuck what you said, fuck out my bed, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I think they got me on my meds
Got a bitch that give that Nancy Reagan head
Carter that era, she was humping my leg
Bush era, she be close to the dead Trump Era, I'll be killing the feds
(REAL TRAP SHIT)



[Intro]
Yesterday I thought I was having a heart attack

Oh you ain't got your flag now, nigga what
No badge no gun you is not tuff
Got the Benilli M4 with the big nuts
Toucan Sam whip it like big bruh, pay homage
You are not a guest, you're a hostage
Rap game thirsty, piss same color as Logic
White boys act tough, I don't give no fucks
Heard he acting like Dex, beat his ass till he Russ

[Chorus]
Keep it on the hush
I heard that yo momma, sister, auntie, getting touched
Gat in my lap, catch me surfin stormfront

[Verse 2]
I put the Judge in seat, I send that bitch to the bing
I heard she pray to Allah, nah bitch you praying to me

You niggas marching for peace, I make they family weep
Kill em or give em the beats, we point the gun at your seed
Nigga

[Chorus 2]
And I’m riding in that Bentley coupe bitch
Fuck a Trump and a fucking coon Bitch yea

[Brad Paisley]

[Intro]
Niggas probably thinking I’m loud as shit

[Chorus]
I’m rolling
Fuck that nigga, I’m Rollins
3rd Reich nigga I’m Stallin
Curb stomp all my opponents
Aw baby I’m dying, I’m crying

[Intro]
Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

[Verse]
Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front—"I'm on One"
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

[Outro]
Surgical Summer, Volume 1
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
Yeah, DAYTONA
Album of the motherfuckin' year
And you talkin' 'bout you upset
Hahahahaha
Well, I wanna see what it's like when you get angry, okay?
You show me that
Push!

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 1: Pusha T + Kanye West]
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him, yuugh!
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I’m goin' four door

[Hook: Ghostface Killah + Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Step on they necks 'til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
(Woo!) They shit is shoppin' at Targét
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (ay!)
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Hah)
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuuugh!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uhh
Cause we can't get along - no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough, to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since ‘94
I don’t know what I, I don’t know what y'all talkin’ bout
And my eagle — still got it all in the bag, B
Yeah, all I did was play possum
Yo, come on

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the Mac-11
My big lion haven’t ate since twelve, and it’s after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin’ their wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I’m not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

[Hook: Ghostface Killah + Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

[Outro: Kanye West]
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told
(I don't know but I've been told)
If you get fresh get all the hoes
(If you get fresh get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes
(I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody please pick out they clothes
(Somebody please pick out they clothes)
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead; yuugh!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis, either that
Or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession, let's get it

[Samples]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"They must be on the dick of who?"



[Intro]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

[Post-Chorus: The Dream & Pusha T]
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

[Post-Chorus: The Dream & Pusha T]
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

[Outro: Notorious B.I.G.]
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time



[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

[Refrain: Pusha T]
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right

I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (wooo!)
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (wooo!)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (wooo!)
Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces

[Refrain: Pusha T]
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these motherfuckers hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload

[Refrain: Pusha T]
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right

My whole team winning, no vision on quitting

[Intro]
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

[Verse]
The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until "Annie"
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I "y tu" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don't even write your songs?
But let us all play along
We all know what niggas for real been waitin' on
Push

[Outro]
I do, so, yeah
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

I'm gone, I'm gone, you hear me?
I'm gone

[Intro]
(Yeaaah!) How you feelin'?
(Fiiiine!) Feel alright?!

[Verse 1]
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga, your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death, it's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leapin' from the free throw

[Break]
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

[Verse 2]
(Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day, God

[Break]
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
It's the blackout, 'Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle

[Hook: Pusha T]
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem
Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin'
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must, like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

[Hook: Pusha T]
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!"
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me

[Hook: Pusha T]
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind



[Chorus: Kanye West]
Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?" (we do)
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box (fuse box)
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here

[Chorus: Pusha-T]
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Poop, scoop!
Whoop! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
"You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
Got a surrogate, his kid get two dads"
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate misdirection ya

[Skit: Tomi Lahren]
Your husband was drug dealer
For 14 years he sold crack cocaine

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Federico Fellini in the flesh
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Bitch I been brackin’ since the ‘80s
Google me baby, you crazy
’89 in London pull the Benz up
Type it in, Google’s your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer and still counting
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit
IRS should’ve had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that’s for the Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it’s like multiple choices
I told ‘em pull the Royce up
I’m getting ghost, I’m hearing noises
I think it’s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries ‘em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‘bout me
Ask the Federalis ‘bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, “Gimme 12”
He told them to go to hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y’all think Uber’s the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take ‘em to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
I’m a course of miracles with this shit
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn’t find a decent job
Life made me ambidextrous
Countin’ with my right, whippin’ white with my left wrist
Daaaaaaaamn Daniel
FBI keep bringing them all white vans through

Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her

'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the Molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record

Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag

I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
And it's cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
Got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her... man

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...

Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl you throw it back like one love
Even let me splash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...
Would you fuck me for free?

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem
It's We The Best OVO
Summers ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one
Bless up



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I stay down with my day-one niggas
And we in the club, screamin'

Money counter go *brrrr* when you sellin' out the Garden
Four-car garage, pornstar ménage
Birdman go *brrrr* 'cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom
Yes, Lord, OVO Sound, man, I'm proud of my niggas
Knew that we would make it, never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Aye, that's luxury, dawg
Day-one niggas, man, y'all stuck with me, dawg
Ever since YouTube, niggas been callin' me the leader of the new school; fuck with me, dawg, yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Your bitch all in my photographs
Ho niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified
Nothin' niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game
Feed fam, nigga, fuck fame
All black, my whip foreign
These bad hoes keep tiptoein'
Down in Turks and Caicos
Dope boy, that's my dress code
All I hug is blood, nigga
Khaled, that's my flesh, ho
All I want is love, nigga
Money bring that stress though
Smoke good, I love life
Strip club like e'ry night
E'ry night my same niggas
Day one, straight menace (Rozay!)

[Hook: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas
I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Niggas always askin' me the key
'Til you own your own you can't be free
'Til you're on your own you can't be me
How we still slaves in 2016?
Key to life, keep a bag comin'
Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga
Special cloth talk here
All my niggas from the mud damn near
All my niggas millionaires
We gon' take it there, I swear
You gon' think a nigga's psychic
You ain't seen nothin' like this
I should probably copyright this
I promise they ain't gonna like this

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I got a bag for lawyers, like, "Fuck your charges!"
Hop out the courtroom, like, "What charges?"
Big pimpin' on your court steps
Case y'all ain't notice, I ain't lost yet
Y'all know it's one of one
Soon as you hear that uh, uh, uh
Y'all know the difference right
From rap facts and fiction, right?
Real life I'm like HOV, real life I'm life goals
In real life they're like me? In real life I'm like, "No."
My swag different, that bag different
My wife Beyoncé, I brag different
My baby Blue (What else?)
I dream in color (What else?)
That's too much flavor (What else?)
I don't rap to suckas (Ha!)
God bless you all, I only talk special talk
I only talk special cloth
Said I only talk special, ah!

[Chorus: Future]
I got the keys, the keys, the keys
I got the keys, the keys, the keys (Wraith talk)

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Drake]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm 'on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "Fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches Mazeltov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

Yo, he ain't messin' with no average chick, pop, pop

Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron-Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes

Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap, but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me lil' mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want Céline
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
Seein' two G-wagons in my driveway
FaceTime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Took you shoppin' in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got the see Balmain
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes

You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh

Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Both arms, yeah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Walked down, had me sittin' up
Demanded my attention, had to give it up
Look like somebody designed you
Drop-dead gorgeous, you make me wanna live it up
Your presence is critical
Movin' my soul, yeah you're spiritual
They hate it when you notice me
Like everybody else invisible (ooh)
Breakin' all the rules (oh-oh)
So above the law (so above the law)
I'll be your excuse (damn right)
Uh, and you won’t go wrong, no

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer (no-brainer)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I had some problems back home (So I heated up)
I ain't with that bullshit at all (Then I laid it down)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga, say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard (And stay stunting)
Oh, but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'ma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been serving
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'ma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'ma hold you down

Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck (Oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
30!
Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AK's with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing
Dog I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
The masta of the ace sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
I try to escape it hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old and time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
Took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
Triple X



[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
You niggas don’t even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Verse 4: Earl Sweatshirt]
Good, hood
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 2001
Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, "Why you got your couch on my Chucks?"
Motherfucker



[Verse 1]
Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up

[Chorus]
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

[Verse 2]
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills, got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man, they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Nigga catch a heart attack
Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

[Chorus]
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?



[Chorus]
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
What he won't do, bitch, I will
What he won't do, bitch, I will
What he won't do, bitch, I will
What he won't do, bitch, I will

[Verse 1]
Take it off, baby, bend over, let me see it
You looking for a real pussy eater? I can be it
Quit playing with me, girl, and bring that over here
And climb aboard my face, put that pussy on my beard
I ain't tryna take you shopping, buy your ass no shoes
I'm tryna lick that clit while I'm looking up at you
No shame in my game, girl, look back at me
I don't give a fuck if it's shaved or it's nappy
Long as it ain't nasty, sanitation smelling
One whiff of that bitch, I'mma be bailing
If it's smelling sweet, I'mma lick it for a hour
And even if it's sour, I might lick it in the shower
I go dumb and ignorant when I'm on that clitoris
Lick your ass delirious, my tongue game so damn serious
So bend that ass over, let me eat it from the back
That pussy so good, have a nigga coming back

[Chorus]
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
What he won't do, bitch, I will
What he won't do, bitch, I will
What he won't do, bitch, I will
What he won't do, bitch, I will

[Verse 2]
Oh, that nigga scared, let me show you what it's 'bout
Spread apart them lips, put that clit up in my mouth
And that thang so juicy, I'mma call it jamba
Licking it in circles got me calling me your papa
Tongue going faster, singing La Labamba
Tryna keep my rhythm like the bongos in samba
I'm a pussy monster, blowing on that ganja
After I finish, look like you was in a sauna
Toes curling up while you're grabbing on the sheets
Spitting on that pussy real sloppy when I eat
Slobbing on that pussy, after that, I don't cuddle
I put that dick up on her, make her sleep up in the puddle
Bitch, I ain't afraid, I eat it up in public
Feet up on the windshield, broad day, fuck it
Sixty-nine in hotels with the lights on
Tongue worth a million, I don't need ice on

[Outro]
Put a cup up, put a four in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Them hoes playing, they don't wanna fuck
I'mma put they ass out, they gone be walking, bruh
And I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel
Said I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel



[Intro]
"Ain't gonna be too many suckers, and furthermore, I think you better check ya mitts"
"Baby come on lets cut this place loose"
"Eyyy chump, you better get the fuck out of here, and take ya bitches with ya, especially ug mug here."

[Verse 1]
The Hybrid smoking on Papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis, what you write is all vagina
What I write is Wall of China, nigga, that's great
Like eighths of Grape Ape getting stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on your mixtape
Nah, literally, shit all on your mixtape
Wipe with the credits, leave stains on the Jewel case
In just two takes, dog, the booth'll get souffléd
You're hiding something like a toupee
Truthfully, my friend: touché
You gon' get exposed like an up-and-coming model
And to me your label seems like one of them pageant mamas
So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick: That's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol, heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you'd take a pencil through your temple
Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even have pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the Ave' cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without the seasoning
Nigga, that's bland, fuck you up and ya mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize, I throw your ass off the boardwark
Fag, you ain't play sports, but always at the ball park
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fucking Walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in the fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm running from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

[Verse 2]
I'm a smart nigga that do dumb shit
In your baby momma crib, not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers, you blank shooters
On stank hooters, I'm in Aruba sipping wine cooler
Mind ruler, sort of like hypnotism
That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it, like Mike Bivins
But to me your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked, beauty supply sandals
Handle any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irritated when I'm not sedated
Fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fucking with them freak hoes
Stank pussy smelling like Cool Ranch Doritos



[Pre-Hook: Danny Brown]
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies
On the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state Pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied do her best but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel?
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette and a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up nigga tryna get a couple bucks

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Iverson zig zags, good night fast food
If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Now he stashing cracks in some hundred dollar shoes
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mommy up, cause he tryna get braided
What we gon' do see the local dope man
See if he can put some money in our hand
Same one jump me, the same one front me
Cause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry
Now I'm in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up nigga tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison

Like Lieutenant Dan, I'm rolling
Back to back, I keep on smoking
Eyes keep shaking and I can't stay focused
I'm fucked if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweating, but I'm cold
Mouth all dry, but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle, chug that down
But I think I need me some more
And I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint
But fuck that, nigga, pass me that drank
I done drunk too much
I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch, I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doing

[Verse 2]
Now all these rappers talking 'bout that molly
Bet a million dollars, these niggas ain't dipping
Pure MDMA, put it in a shot, we talking 'bout crystals
Been thizzing hard up all day
Rest in peace to Mac Dre
Throw up the T, scratch on my face
Do the Thizzle Dance up in the place
I'm grinding on your bitch
While I'm grinding on my teeth
Don't give a flying fuck
So right now you don't want beef
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party

She licked it off my index
Before that she been wet
Now she licking on her best friend
While they suck me watching sunset
That's right bitch, we ain't done yet
Lifting up her sundress
It kicked in she licking
Before I blink, she undressed
Molly making her feel good
It's a feeling, she can't explain
But obvious, we got some problems
So bitch, let's kill that pain
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doing

Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone



[Verse 1]
Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like Sci-Fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffin' Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Trippin' off the shit that had Brian Wilson flippin'
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm livin'

[Chorus]
And I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy, spike that with some Molly
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, God bless my soul
But life is so sublime, goin' out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame
Feelin' like Keith Moon, shrooms in my dressin' room
Basquiat freestyle
Feelin' like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole's mouth
River Phoenix '93 VIP
With some drugged up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell havin' orgies where the horns growin' long
'Cause, bitch, I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowin' hershey
I'ma die like a rockstar



[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down in an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smelling like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

[Bridge]
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Get high, my niggas smoke kush
Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a mothafuckin' phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga bumping 2Pac
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap (I'm out)

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Half asleep with that cotton mouth, weed grow house on plantation
Nuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen
Got my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky, so nigga roll something with me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we stayin up, nigga gotta keep one eye open
Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sipping on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby momma sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

[Bridge]
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma



[Verse 1]
Kush got a nigga feeling awesome
Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin
Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy
Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me
Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need
I got some Adderall and fire ass weed
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie, if so, bitch, I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Xanny nodding off watching Menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

[Hook]
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

[Verse 2]
'til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven even if she gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties
We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies
And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt

[Hook]
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt



[Pre-Hook: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick; she's on a strict diet
That's my baby, with no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said: "‘Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody."
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't!
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said: "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud."
I said: "Baby, just make me cum, then don't make a sound."

[Pre-Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Real nigga, fuck these haters!
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, $69.96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges; Lil Tunechi!

[Pre-Hook: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating
I'm getting ass, or I'm skating
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

[Outro: Drake]
Rip rip, nigga



[Intro]
M-M-Murda

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like "nah"

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, "Alright, alright, alright"
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, "Babe, I think I love you, kinda"
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word



[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever—first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown—Nino
She insist she got more class—we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me—Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled—chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal—I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness—bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money; Benjamin Button "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world, like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me, when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me – no, you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class: Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello—it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top!"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go—packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go—Macadamian—they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow—fuck no!
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over—oh, no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth-fillings
Come flyin' up outta of our mouths—now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me—how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake—

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man



[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation!
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

I'm goin' back in…

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with 5-0
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talkin', we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind ya back like nunchucks and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She's blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

[Hook: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turnt a penny to a motherfuckin Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance
Ho, what's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter, yeah, murder, 187
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, Promethazine with Codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch and pussy feel just like heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt, R.I.P. — Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up, every night I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here nigga, fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

[Hook: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And your nigga a ho



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell
You know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Chorus 1: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get 'em," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I say get him"
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'"
She say, "What's missin'?", "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed"
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh

[Chorus 2: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!"
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told ya"
She gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now think for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga
Mona

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Kendrick Lamar]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah



[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 2: Logic]
I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm, dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes, on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Outro: Sam Harris]
More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'...



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say "choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will



[Intro]
Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Hook]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Hook]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat



[Produced by Dr. Dre & DJ Yella]

[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!"
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!



[Intro: Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

[Interlude: Eazy E (MC Ren)]
Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Outro]
Damn, that shit was dope!



[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG, but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese
No deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's, the Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said "Mothafuck the police!"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all! If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge when I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryin' to walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies—sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie! (Dada?)

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop comin' up to me
With your hands out, lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of Compton, I told 'em all
All them little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all ‘cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg, (Dr. Dre)]
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
(‘Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and a–
It's like that and like this and like that and a–
It's like this and like that and like this and a–
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught ‘cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and a–
It's like that and like this and like that and a–
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode

[Refrain: Kid Dynamite + Public Enemy (Congress Alley)]
You’ve got the feeling
To rock the other side
You’ve got the feeling (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah!) So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah!)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip then I'm slippin'
But if I got my niña then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit I'ma have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
Like this, that and this and a–
It's like that and like this and like that and a–
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode

[Refrain: Kid Dynamite + Public Enemy (Congress Alley)]
You’ve got the feeling

You’ve got the feeling (yeah, yeah)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99, nigga,  guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Off the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air! Well, you's a fool Dr.



[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
"Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!" ‘cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party for sure
Slip my ho a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair
Bitch, quit talkin', Crip walk, stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch, shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S, you'll be relievin' your stress

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre]
La-da-da-da-dahhh

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Straight off the fuckin' streets of C-P-T
King of the beats, you ride to 'em in your Fleet (Fleetwood)
Or Coupe DeVille rollin' on dubs
How you feelin' whoopty whoop, nigga what?
Dre and Snoop chronic'd out in the 'llac
With Doc in the back, sippin' on 'gnac
Clip in the strap, dippin' through hoods (what hoods?)
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the westside; it's California Love
This California bud got a nigga gang of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on, and my team strong
Get my drink on and my smoke on
Then go home with somethin' to poke on
Loc, it's on for the two-triple-oh
Comin' real, it's the next episode

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Hold up, hey
For my niggas who be thinkin' we soft, we don't play
We gonna rock it 'til the wheels fall off
Hold up, hey
For my niggas who be actin' too bold, take a seat
Hope you ready for the next episode
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Smoke weed every day

[Intro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit
Can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you
And that's just being real with you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth
And we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you?
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Verse 3: Eminem + Dr. Dre]
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back
(Right) Just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
Nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
"Whose throat is it?"
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream "I just don't give a fuck" and see who means it

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

[Outro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and-- *Gunshot*



[Skit]
Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
(Yeah, about that…)

[Intro: Candice Pillay]
Don't let me find out the bitch in you
Don't let me find out the snitch in you

[Hook: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc

[Hook: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word them
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a (Doctor's) assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—

[Hook: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders, Doctor's orders



[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize, and pass to Daz

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fucking hoes, clocking dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chilling with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this
(Biatch)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy-Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothing but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from Tha Pound and "we don't love them hoes"
How could you trust a ho? (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a ho's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, "Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues"
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, "Dre, pass the Glock"
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit)
I un-cock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit

[Verse 5: Jewell]
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung, and with the nuts hung

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit



[Intro: Daz Dillinger & (Snoop Dogg)]
(Ugh) Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot

See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million-dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat

The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Matter fact, you should take four, b
And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Hook: Bruno Mars]

We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[Intro]
You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

[Hook]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

[Hook]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none



[Skit: Heron and Joe Cool]
("Indo Smoke" Plays in Background)
Aye, aye,  JC
'Sup Enron
Ain't that Snoop Dogg over there?
That nigga with that blue coat on?
Yeah
Yeah, oh yeah, that's that nigga
Nigga roll up on the side of him, man
Roll your window down
Man, hand me my motherfucking Glock man, give me another clip
Cause I'm gonna smoke this fool
Yeah roll the windows down
Yeah, okay there you go
Aye man, you Snoop Dogg?

Man he's Snoop Dogg
Man fuck that nigga (Gun Shots)
Nigga man

What set you got now?
Fuck you nigga
Yeah nigga, what's up?
Nigga
Yeah mothafucka
Yeah nigga, one less nigga
Yeah nigga, you's a dead motherfucker now

[Verse 1]
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

[Hook]
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)

[Bridge]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 3]
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

[Hook]
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Man don't you know that I'm loco

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Uh-huh, hmm... I was chillin, right around my way (way!)
21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin shit with his homies like he was a straight.. G
Askin where I'm from while he runnin up
Gangbang, my set on e'ry one of 'em (true)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close
It's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead now I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case really you could see
I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck yo!
See these niggas proceed to speed
So fulfill the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth God... damn!
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact I could be "Beast of the East" motherfucker!
I never hesitate to blaze (blaze!)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples
Is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Put the bang on the song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by!)
It's a shame but somebody's gotta die (die!)
They see it happens state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin L.A., all I hear the ese's say - they go...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!

Snoop Dogg, him bust gunshots
Skateboard P, you know him bust gunshots (come again, now!)

I'm tired of hearin all that bullshit
When you gon' play some of that good shit... damn
I mean give me some like a...



[Intro]
Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

[Verse 1]
Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
For all my doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day

I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a strech, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said "Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?"
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard!"
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, "oh no"
I went back in, "I forgot my Indo!"
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard-to-get
So I said "What's wrong?" cause she looked upset
She said um:

[Nancy Flethcer]
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me

[Verse 2]
Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi!"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, "What was goin on?"
I tried to break it up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her!"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying

"Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay"

And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born!
I said "Cheer up!" and I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!"
She said, "No you're not!" then she starts cryin
I says I'm 19, she says, "Stop lyin!"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"

[Outro]
Yeah, uh, tick-tock ya don’t stop
And to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
Yeah, n'ya tick-tock ya don’t stop
And to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
Biatch!



Yeah, that's right, I like that
("The royal penis is clean your highness")

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey), your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
So if you think you got the bomb shit
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
And if you lookin' for some good sex

Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"



[Chorus: Pharrell & (Stevie Wonder)]
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
They do the fingers like Redd Foxx, hey (in Los Angeles)
You can make it on a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls, yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask you can you roll?
You say roll, don't you know that I'm from round here?
Well girl I like the way you roll
Even though you from the ghetto you belong in a home in the mountains
Not talking 'bout the view
I'm talking 'bout me and you
So if you wanna go to Melrose
Let's hit Adidas, girl we got our own shell toes
And then we'll go to Venice
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it
For like 15 minutes
Girl, you never gon' forget it
And if you wanna go around town
I could show you where all the real get it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talking 'bout them fools
I'm talking 'bout me and you

[Chorus: Pharrell & (Stevie Wonder)]
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls
They do the fingers like Redd Foxx, hey (in Los Angeles)
You can make it on a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California rolls, yeah

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
And when I hand you that weed and I ask if you can roll?
You say no, let me show you around here
Cowgirl wanna roll with a winner
Rodeo with a winner, Rodeo loud yeah
Ain't got nothing to lose
I'm talking 'bout me and you
And girl I got a home in that valley, in a rolls in that valley
Just tell 'em what my name is
You heard about me, you heard all about me
Mean you heard all the hittas that I'm with gangbanging
But I ain't talking 'bout the news (I'm talking 'bout me and you)
Girl you know that I'm talking 'bout you
Let me show you all around
I could show you where all the real get it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talking bout them fools
I'm talking 'bout me and you

[Intro: Eminem]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But I'm only going to get this one chance."
"Something's wrong, I can feel it."
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."
"You are just what the doc ordered."

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bust a rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk—so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for (Satan); it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you



[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna and (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna and (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna and (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)



[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man



[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now, yeah!

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an MC
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (get it)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the temps might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us." (ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date."  "Looks like an olive to me."
"Look, there's an apple!"  "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger Kang, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners



[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run



[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!

[Scratch]

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah



[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life, I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Ayy, yah yah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta' went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (Ayy)
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me "Cujo" (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant until the beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feed-back and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice



[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it, slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (nope)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, "he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew)—Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a [faggot], bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (ha), sorry if I took forever (haha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to
Everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you probably can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (woo!)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch! (yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire



[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the— it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's— it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"



[Hook: Meechy Darko]
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Lions don't lose sleep over the 'pinion of sheep
On the road to the riches, money sticking to my cleats
I am moi, magnifique, skin noir, Darky Meech
Niggas with the most opinions usually have the least
It's funny how now rappers be on their druggy shit
Downloaded my tape, sat back, studied shit
Acid pack a hundred hits, shroom caps and hash bricks
Trippy like that Destiny Child chick on 106
This white bitch had the fucking nerve to call me a nigga
When she the one paying the surgeon for her lips to get bigger
Do you get the bigger picture? Shit is backwards, my nigga
You sneak dissing, taking jabs, get your boxing on
Cause you ain't get the word, I'm Glock Lesnar in the octagon
This shit is straight absurd, do not hate me cause your life is shitty
I show no pity, you turd, you better off in the dirt
Now you better off dead, like the title of my work

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Every day; me and Mary Jane
You might say I'm addicted, but me, I'm truly lifted
Stoned so loud, you can hear me in the crowd
Smoking girl scout, sour by the ounce
Mary never cheat me
Mary not a backstabbing bitch that'll lie and deceive me
Spread it even, even, hash wax in the evening
Dab or die trying, on the road to Zion
Damn, they try and stick me for my paper
They trying to take me under, I've seen it through the vapors
Jealous ones still envy, got a couple real with me
And my bitch will talk some shit and smoke the kil' with me
Meech will hide the body, enough of that though
They saying talk is cheap, so I'll be smiling when we meet
They screaming "Zombies!" out in England
But I'm on the block with Mary, pushing and dreaming
Ah ah ah, I'm feeling myself
Thizzle, fo' shizzle, my nizzle, spitting riddles on instrumentals
Trippy life, blotter in the night
Fill my appetite (Fill my appetite)

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliot]
Could be your mans, or be your fan, or be your kin
Pay your dues, man, I gotta choose, whether I lose or win this
Foe or friend, can't determine the difference
The instance they see you peaking, they pussy be leaking fluid
My nigga, what is you doing, all black in the back of a Buick
I'm proving I'm sadistic as sin, as I'm making murderous music
We don't rep the same things, nah, don't bother confuse it
So much stressing on my brain, momma think I'ma lose it
Human vagabond, hoes that stow they panties in my carry on
Why you hating niggas acting nonchalant (Honest, brah)
Fuck your publication that say I'm a third wheel
Architect build your mind, set stress but won't swell
Oh yes, I smoke kill, I'm crack, you smoke krills
I pack, you dope deal, in fact, I'm so chill
I'm never off the pivot, six stitches to your image
Not offended when you call me genius, all that means is

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
What the bloodclot? What the blood
Get M-E-T-H-O-D, Drought 3 Dwayne Carter
With a splash of Busta's craft and a hint of Big Poppa
Little dash of Nasty Nas, top it off with Bob Marley
Throw 'em all in a blender and I'm what the fuck you get
And imagine that like a figment
I'm a walking, talking enigma
Something you never figure
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, I am like Randy Savage on acid
That's very vibrant and classic
A walking disaster, hazard to any rapper
That’s rapping, we the underground killas
But globally they feel us cause we restoring the feeling
This guru spit voodoo, yes
I am that mass appealing, I'm feeling up on her breasts
She swallowing all my children
Rack in my mouth, teeth made of gold
I'm sucking the areolas, my nigga, the best of both
Double entendre
And if they auctioning niggas, then I'm the top product
What am I saying, they used to auction our forefathers
Where is my mind, shit, I can't find it
Like looking for remote control after smoking marijuana
How is he so niggerish, yet so enlightened
It can't be possible, he living everything he rhyming
I feel like we entered the game at remarkable timing

[Hook: Zombie Juice]
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga
I made more than I can fit in this quote, nigga
Quote, nigga, we the hope, nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
I assemble sentences so I can reap the benefits
And I never see my nemesis, but I'm working on my penmanship
I counted many blessings, stressing women, nothing less of winning
If I'm talking shit, shit, man, I'm only kidding
Sitting on the sphere, Earth is spinning, persevere
2012 is here and instill a different kind of fear
It's material, and I ain't talkin fashion
Believe in what you want, cause no one knows to seem what happens
Ya bastards
Since I smoked the cohiba, I'm evil
Zombies be competition, six feet deep beneath your people
Only illegal amounts of the medicine'll get you in a bind
I already got your heart, girl, I wanna fuck your mind
But since I came, developed my name, the author oughta slap you hard
I never drop the acid, bruh, I'm trippy as fuck
Because I'd rather knock it down instead of picking you up
So cut the ash right through the diamond, my hair wrapped up like a shaman

[Hook: Zombie Juice]
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga
I made more than I can fit in this quote, nigga
Quote, nigga, we the hope, nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice]
Cruising down the street, ain't got a 6-4
Just a heart full of pride, a mouth full of gold
Corny baby mama knocking at my front do'
She just want my income, I'd rather get my dick sucked
I be that Z-O-M-B, shawty don't tempt me
Leather on, Fonzirelli, piss on women, R. Kelly
Smashing bitches in the telly, passing swishers rolled up with me
Trippy is as trippy does, catch me smoking potent, cuz
Having visions of Mason Betha coming back
Spitting crack, contemplating how we living under Satan
Discriminating and hating, this ain't rap
I call it food for the savoring
What's your craving, na-not for paparazzi, the most
Incredible dope, feta, cheddar, the revenue
Never seen federal, gotta stay 'head of the server, the Hedetet
Love my medical-hating niggas disguised as friends
I see the lies, wannabes, little Gs
Peep the A-P-Cs, I'm a G-O-D
Rep the N-Y-C, we got U-N-I, T-Y
It's time y'all get off my N-U-T-Zs, please
I got the scoop, ain't that about a bitch
Take a flick with the microphone ripper, gravedigger
Hairy black ball nigga, sicker than your average
Twisting dank, fucking hoes on the kitchen sink
What you think?



[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Today I purchased a coffin and I ain't even die yet
Smoked about a hundred blunts and I ain't even high yet
Wrote my verse in poison ink, watch you biters digest
Got the illest grind yet, no eye can deny this
Lungs full of uh, eyes bloody red, nigga
Gold fangs on, uh, pocket full of dead niggas
Smoke some, bitch, what the fuck you waiting on?
I know it's a virtue, but baby, my patience is gone
Get our relation on, take her to a vacant home
What you want, a quicky sticky? Okay, I won't takey long
Split the dutch down the middle like Moses did the sea
Count it up, bag it up, we love money, we love weed
Met this one bimbo, told her my name was Meech
But she keep calling me Mandingo
My eyes bloody red so she probably think I'm evil
Truly, it's the weed smoke from all this sour diesel
Light it, then I breathe slow

[Hook]
Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me, yo
Fuck the police though, we smoke it like it's legal
Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me, yo
Fuck the police though, we smoke it like it's legal

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Juicy, Mr. Young Bone, AK, I'm so gone
Hoes love me - Jeroooome, hoes love me - Jerooooome
Sit back, get smacked, get stoned
In the back of the back of the room
With a Mac in the back of the room, she acting doomed
Blaow, splat in the room
Women, they awful, I mean they on fours
Call this my dumb flow, Urkel, Waldo
Call this my purp flow, roll up the indo
I'm here, dog, what you here for?
Hip-hop is dead, Zombies for prez
Remindy, untimely, two blunts I'm Siamese
Pussy, we grind thee, sticky and grimey, wicked unchain me
Twisted my frame be, blunt after blunt after blunt
So stuck, so stuck off the what?
Sticky, icky, quickly, vicky, lick me, no hickeys, gin and whiskey
Just me and some kitties, swiftly

[Hook]
Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me, yo
Fuck the police though, we smoke it like it's legal
Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me, yo
Fuck the police though, we smoke it like it's legal



[Intro: Meechy Darko]
Woah woah
Woah woah huh
Woah woah huh

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
YSL pants with the zippers—yikes!
Met her this evenin', 'ready hit it, twice
Tag on your soul everybody got a price
Acid, acid, change yo' life
Bape if she hip, Saint Laurent if she bougie
I'm faded like Boosie
She call me Meechy over, I slide in that coochie
Nosedive in that coochie
My dick is big, it should be wearin' a Coogi
I’m in Nice of France
Tie-dyed my lifestyle
Even bleached the pants
Next week Japan
Thom Browne bubble lens, eyes need the tint
Flatbush, Brooklyn, from the County of Kings
Run up on me like I'm some hippie nigga
And die under the knife, Joan Rivers
Ooh, damn, that punchline delivers
Hold up wait a minute, moment of silence
Hm, fuck it
Let's get back to wylin'
Blood on your Timbs, Shoot Shoot
Blood at your limbs, tuh tuh
Slugs hit your rims
Ambidextrous, I shoot with two hands
Even got blood on your friends
I think I just flooded the Benz
Damn it, baby, Meechy's at it again
M-M-Murder, murder, murder
Capital M with two gats in my hand

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Everyday a nigga wake up, got to blaze a little chronic
Thank the universe, a blessing, new day, a new dollar
Middle finger to my niggas and my bitches two times
Representing for my niggas in the hood it's no ceiling
Sellin', trappin' like a villain, cold
Should've made a killing, go
Finger played with it, yo
Nigga stay with it
Hate a nigga, fade him quicker now
Numb dum diddy dum I, I, I, I, I
High like the sun
Fetch a frequency, this ain't shit to me
She said she got a friend, then let my nigga beat
Meech roll 'em, bust 'em, cannons, wooh
Spliff long looking like a Manson
I'm on acid feeling like the Hamptons
She feeling freaky beat the pussy like a champion
Young nigga but I'm still O.G
Supreme Team like 1993
Triple 6 on my coffin, I dance with the devil
Came back with a vengeance, Christ off the hinges
I'm nice with the spit kid, twice as much vicious
Psycho-active, I'm on a mission
Electric KoolAde
Make your decision
You want it, I get you
These niggas ain't right, they can't write they own shit
But they smile in your face, and they claim they the shit
But to me a disgrace
Trying to keep steps ahead like we running a race
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make
Free my niggas lawd, made it right today
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
Not a thug but niggas know how I keep mine
Call her up or quick to throw up the peace sign
Throw that pussy, let me hit it
Girl, I got to get it
Saying she got a feeling, she let a young nigga hit it
Back and forth cause we smoke them seven grams
Real boss shit I don’t expect you to understand
My performance, dreams at 14
Now I hear them calling two to their seats
Won’t slip away this is serious business
Voidin the mischief while spending these Benjamins
Surrender potential pussy to me
Brought to you by the ungrateful police
Conscious keep telling me, beautiful melody
Will exhibit if I trip on the L.S.D
Nah, window for money and dro
Some people think I spend money for show
Spending show money
Flip like aerobics
Components will kill my opponents
I sit on my throne, it's enormous
Composed with the chorus
My karma is good, dog, and don't need supportin'
My bitch is so gorgeous, I cannot afford
To spend time with her when chasin' these whores
Money, keep countin'
She strip like Lance Mountains
My passport is packed
How I travel, astoundin' (Yeah)
"Thug Waffle"—did that
Now we comin' back for the killer contract
Pull up on your pampers
Three man army
Address the bitch niggas in a song, call it Palm Trees
Not a fan of you if you ain't ever hug my moms, b
Not a fan of niggas that be talkin' where I'm gon' be
Talk a lot of mess, leave you niggas out of pocket
Don't talkin' to me less you talkin' bout a profit

[Outro: Zombie Juice and Meechy Darko]
Universe a blessing, a new day a new dollar
Tag on your soul, everybody got a price
Acid, acid change yo' life

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]
All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame
Form your business in the name, something unique like a slang
Make a difference, make a change
But ain’t no puppets on a string
Don’t be chilling on the couch, remember this is for the clout
Remember this is for the poor niggas that’ll represent you when you’re out
Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Always was a winner even when I wasn’t 'posed to
The money getting bigger as if it wasn’t supposed to
Just a lonely nigga, talk too much to myself, need a break
On July 8th broke down heaven’s gates
Now I stay high all day
Fuck you leaving, fuck all evening
Call me mister fuck all day
Trap all day and night
Don’t need a house much less you ‘bout some change
Expand my conscious, tryna’ walk on water
Feel the earth on me
You hatin’, I’ll be somewhere slayin’ bitches by their face on me
Catch a fade, Kobe, with an eighth on me
Not phased, don’t pass that shit homie
Cough, smoke, cough, got my shit sealed off
‘Bout to put some in the air, ‘til a nigga doze off
Cos you got some shrooms, I got a room
You and me ‘til we reach the moon
Never wore a disguise, love the skin I’m in
You trade your soul for fame, we ain’t built the same

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]

All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
All I ever wanted was to be a one to one
Now I’m one in three
Compulsively a nigga gotta run up or get none
Know I feel your pain, a different day
Opinions always alter when you’re done
Pray to put you down, afraid to look around, instead I pen it for my dogs (Hoo!)
Know my city give me 150 for my steez, 150 for my beats
Three niggas, we gotta eat
Shouts to fans that’s overseas, hey
Independent grind, at least we did form a company
We a bond that never breaks, never giving up the cake
Not a fan of pointing fingers at men
It’s dependent on who can pay for academics
Homie your chemists are missing appendages
You back into handling business, no kidding
My head’s at the clinic, I need a prescription
My vision is clearer through smoke and them mirrors
I can’t be compared to those niggas you hearing
So don’t be offended when niggas don’t feel you

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Feeling brave? Nigga run up
Buck shots, tear your muscle
And I don’t need Joey to pump it
Pitbull, no muzzle
Badmon, I’m thuggin’
Done know, gun smoke
Can’t tell me nothin’, there’s no need for discussion
I’m the sinner in Saint, I'm the box logo bully
Used to buy Bathing Ape, now they send this shit to me
I paved the way for niggas that're scared to say what they ain't wanna say
Now watch a demon demonstrate, annihilate
Love / hate it's all the same
Will I die from my homicide
Or will I die from taking too much drugs?
Lord knows I deserve to die on an acid high and I’m double cupped
Coke line, hundred blunts
Seen a few bitches I’d love to fuck
2Pac in 96 and troublesome
27 club, here I come
Comma, c-c-c-c comma, comma, comma
A whole lot of decimals
I just s-see my account and c-c-c-c-c-c-c count all my blessings up
Bloodstream full of chemical
Crip, Blood, twist your fingers up
Better than some of them veterans
Bet they gon’ say it’s beginners luck
I would die for my niggas, but would they do the same?
Hennessey by the gallon, I'm losing my balance and manage the pain
I would ride for my niggas, just show me the lane
My grandaddy's still in the kitchen, w-w-whipping the ‘caine
My celly’ keep ringing
I cannot find enough coverage to answer
The backwoods is hitting
Hope that that shit is not giving me cancer
Trip on acid while I'm rapping, Sippin' muddy, counting money
I think she took too many xannies, she fell asleep while she was sucking

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
Made it out the gutter, shout out to my mother
Kudos to my papa, he ain’t wear the rubber
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers...

This Odyssey is complete, now you ready for some fucking bars?



[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Reality is wisdom, perspective
Eye like Horus, I don't like whores
Hindsight, oh my, I adore, for the time being, yes, I am yours
Trump, my card, it's the ace of spades
And I hate to go away without getting this money made
But niggas be telling to believe in a reason to act up
Nigga lose his job, blame it all on some bad luck
Roller coaster, my eyes not open
The cold comes every season, trick
In the summer we smoke hunnids, my fall comes often evil shit
Just spews from my mind, I get confused all the time
My wall of space is confined, so you better elevate or lose time
Just lose time

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
Say dat, I don't play that
I be acting as if I'm a better man
And my mother to my brother from another
Boy, oh yes you can
From my sisters that keep the shit right
And my mothers that'll kiss you good night
Forty slugs in my liquor cup
Take a shot and I pick you up
Bang bang from the same gang
Kick rocks if you can't hang
Lil nigga, what you saying, mane?
Roll up but these lame hangs
Rolling up was a plane, mane
In the hood, it's all good, made our own Hollywood
Took a picture the system my mental track me like a alien
I combine thoughts with divine course
And exhale exhaust from my skeleton
Tell her I won't appear again
Fuck that, if I'm going, who will even care again?
Hate to be American, get away from experiments
Cause the truths in the pyramids
Cause we all fucking immigrants
And you're lying through your filaments
Lay back if you drink a bit
And indulge in the nigga shit
This is real nigga rhetoric
Dissolve all the simple shit, play a different game
It's too easy to be ignorant
Lay back, think a bit

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too

[Bridge: Bridget Perez & (Erick Arc Elliott)]
Boy, I must be dreaming (fuck all that other shit)
The way you got me speaking (fuck all that other shit)
Hope that I'm not tripping because (fuck uh, oh god)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do (nah)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
(Two times, two times for my ladies that are not a ho)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
Angel, want me for my peso
Telling other niggas you ain't never gonna wait
So I smash in the Range Rove
Beat beat then I add her to the payroll
Smoke another dub with a cousin and a bro
But I won't say it slow
Missing, representing the people that won't grow
So I carry lethal weapons that beat you through postal
Where the foes go, where we ever gon' go?
To the highest of the Horus eye
Fuck thoughts I am going 'til there's no reply
Flatline, I get lost 'n bossed
Metal cup passed it first
Never parked the cars
We ain't Boston, nigga
Ransom, nigga
We're on some now so explain it to me, nigga
I don't really know but gold ...

[Bridge: Bridget Perez & (Erick Arc Elliott)]
Boy, I must be dreaming (fuck all that other shit)
The way you got me speaking (fuck all that other shit)
Hope that I'm not tripping because (fuck uh, oh god)

Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do (nah)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
(Two times, two times for my ladies that are not a ho)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do

[Outro: Erick Arc Elliott]
Angel, want me for my peso
Telling other niggas you ain't never gonna wait
So I smash in the Range Rove
Beat beat then I add her to the payroll



[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
I blink twice 'til my eyes close on my face
Deep breaths, struggling to reach home base
Awkward nigga, motherfucker, this is a race
God made me great, so I been invisible to hate
Partly humane, part of the same, part of the game
Used to smoke a Parliament before I partied with my pain
And Bacardi was the same, 151 to your brain
But I'd rather beg my pardon than to party with you lames

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
Fuck the law, fuck the president and White House
Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Sit back and analyze my life like Montana did white
All the bitches I hit, and all the bitches I might
Clearly underrated amongst all the favorite
But fuck it, my style's like Magic Speed Seduction
I'ma keep smoking 'til my lungs collapse
And fuck y'all laws, I'ma keep my straps
Setting the plans, controlling mine and reaching the land
I'm better off dead, somebody fill my head up with lead
Dropped out of high school, lint in my pocket
I picked up the profit, the block bitching, bitches is hawking
Grandma don't want me, Grandpa kinda lonely
Pay my dues, wear my jewels, refuse, never I lose
But fuck that, on my last dollar and my bus pass
Fucking with some niggas that'll give a mother fuck
Who fucking with us? No one fucking with us, time to reconsider
Zombie gang, walking dead, none iller

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
Fuck the law, fuck the president and White House
Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Fuck your faculty, your fans, and your music
Fuck the engineer and the nigga that produced it
Fuck your religion, your god, and your guidance
Tell Virgin Mary time for Meech to pop that hymen
Fuck the moon, fuck the stars, fuck Venus and Mars
Fuck a Rolex and diamond ring with them flashy cars
Fuck the last supper, fuck your church and its gospel
Fuck them halfway dead niggas in the hospital
Fuck my left lung, fuck my right lung
Fuck my chrome gun, fuck my black gun
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Drop five bombs, fuck that I'm on
Like the mic I record with, fuck global warming
Fuck heaven and hell, purgatory
Fuck the pastor, fuck you for giving him offering
Fucking exhausted from all these fucks
I'm fucking off this nigga, what the fuck

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right
Fuck the law, fuck the president and White House
Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right



[Intro: Erick Arc Elliot]
Not a good time unless I smoke mine
Too many drugs that make you go blind
Too many thugs that work for more crime
And my nigga show love, unless we get
Not a good time unless I smoke mine
Too many drugs that make you go blind
Too many thugs that work for more crime
And my nigga show love unless we get violent

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
Wildin', this is for my niggas that smoke weed
Live life by the day, count the proceed
Blow it back, blowin' cash in the OZ
Miss the phone, got it on, looking closely
Only independent, we don't need a co-sign
Jah shit, the bud make arms in no time
It's the fourth quarter at the baseline
Kissing your daughter, Mary Jane high
Just the same guys Juice, Darko, and I remarkable times
Ultra dead minds
Zombie-Bape line, no harm it takes time
Enjoy the palm trees
We on vacation

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
Rang, rang
Who that calling? The money or the fame
Shit ain't the same since we crept in the game
So I get high and try to maintain
My celly rang, rang
Who that calling? The money or the fame
Shit ain't the same since we stepped in the game
So I get high and try to maintain

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Gloves on, murder one, homi'
They'll be looking for the prince, like King Jaffe
Smoking Moroccan hashish
With my slanted eye, zombie mommy
Hennessy fill my body
These other rappers copy, oops
I forgot to mention, wrote this in another dimension
Zombie gang, be what I'm repping
Pussy so good I need seconds to step in
Two Mac 11s with twenty K on the necklace and a Heckler Koch
Bought this for the hecklers that be neck in cock
On a mission, clearest vision
Views from the scope from my Glock
Only high percentage shots
You with one eye like Fetty Wap
With my block, Flatbush Ave, rotten flesh and money knots
Never trust these hoes, I never did, never will
I pop a tab and crack a seal, zombie gang, drugs kill
Never lied, if I did then let me fry - Futurama
And these Jordans on my feet don't come out 'til next summer
Pretty grungy like Nirvana
Dirt Cobain is what she holla
When I dropped this dick inside her
Only fuck her if she legal, I don't break the laws like Tyga
Unless it's moving LSD, lean and shrooms and marijuana
If I ever pay for pussy it was with counterfeit dollars
Ugly niggas still getting bitches
I'm like the second Shabba
Hit the trigger 'til my fingers blister
If I got a problem, paint his top - Dennis Rodman
I'm superficial and conscious
I'm a walking contradiction
I'ma burn in hell probably but I'ma keep Satan waiting
I ain't done fornicating with women in every flavour
Eating pussy with chop sticks
You know I love my Asians
You would think, USC who he play with
Trojan helmet on, put her in the backspace
And then I hit the escape key in the bank
With the Jason mask, asking where the safe is
Catch me motorcycle, black and gold Letterman
Saint Laurent, leopard print
I stampede any beat
Nigga I ain't got no preference
I'm setting precedents while chasing Presidents
My mic presence is heaven sent
It's like I got an extra sense, no censorship
I'm in my essence, limitless, no blemishes
My penmanship, a Erving J is jus' always leads to swish
I roll and pick, then blow a zip
You can blow my dick and eat my excrement

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice]
Smoke to death, might lose my ears
Walking dead, can't feel my tears
Fake love in disguise
I repute those that get near
I let my soul fly like fruits from our peers
I got some questions, I got some weed, I got some acid
Needlepoint LSD
I got a bad bitch we could settle fees
And if your eyes open there is still more to see
They try to tell me I was wrong
I'm still looking
Last night I spent a couple hours up in Central Bookings
Only had a dub but I was trapping prostitution
Weed, coca leaves, percs and LSD
Two hundred for the bottle
Add it up, more for me
Thinking back, I'm still here it's lovely
Ripping shows and blowing cheese
Oh, you love me? Soon we'll see
Palm trees and double Ds
They want that old shit?
Well, fuck y'mean?

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
Rang, rang
Who that calling? The money or the fame
Shit ain't the same since we crept in the game
So I get high and try to maintain
My celly rang, rang

[Outro: Phone call]
Shine on these niggas
Glide on these niggas
Show these niggas what the business is, nigga
Zombie Gang, nigga
Huh? Zombie Gang, nigga
Half-dead, nigga
We living life, nigga
Nigga stole the dead the way we living, like, so crazy man
So trill, nigga
Aye, up top, nigga—up top, uh, uh



[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Welcome to my world, visions like my mind
On a thin wire, struggle but I'm here
Still high like it's no fear, tip toe
Like a ballerina, you can't see me, John Cena
Play my cards with a poker face
Sometimes I feel like the only race
Racing, speeding, still hungry like I ain't eating, call it even
A spade a spade, some other hoes, but I live in the shade
Palm trees, fronto, Bob Marley
I'm the dutch master, I'll box you, boy—like Cassius
Put 'em in a casket, like the Taker
21-and-0 on you haters, 21 Os
Step up in the building, something like Elvis
I'm 'bout to re-up, this here better than my last, uh
Mortal thought, living through all of y'all
Treat this shit like my only child, son of God
Calculate my visions, what I want is how I'm living
You might win some, but you just lost one
This beat here banging, Erick Arc, son
If you double cross, you hit the floor, Allen I-son

[Hook: Meechy Darko + Erick Arc Elliot]
Young, dumb motherfucker, life's guns and butter
My grandpop still make that crack rock bubble
Tell karma I love her, been a real good motherfucker
So she bless us with
Pussy, drugs, and money
I ride for my dogs, get high with my dogs
Niggas won't snitch, don't abide by the law
Blowing loud on the porch, Makaveli on my thoughts
How many real niggas will be down for the cause?

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliot]
Some days are made for reminiscing
Drug dealers with no product or pot to even piss in
Permission by granted God we see allah
Molecules, minuscule, and regardless of who you are
You a part of early stardom, I believe we all achieve
In the eyes of martyrs, never a problem
Hearts fall apart so I stitched mine
Quick to choke a nigga, I be tryna bitch mine
Shorty sweet like clementine
I rap for the niggas that make beats but never get to shine, shine
Hey, Vinyl Blue in Green, Miles Davis CDs
I compose my sixteens before eighty-eight keys
The first time I did drugs it was making the beats
MPC bang my head, it even haunts me in sleep
Everybody's a snake, that's why I try to keep the grass cut
See it when they coming, then I heat they ass up

[Hook: Meechy Darko + Erick Arc Elliot]
Young, dumb motherfucker, life's guns and butter
My grandpop still make that crack rock bubble
Tell karma I love her, been a real good motherfucker
So she bless us with
Pussy, drugs, and money
I ride for my dogs, get high with my dogs
Niggas won't snitch, don't abide by the law
Blowing loud on the porch, Machiavelli on my thoughts
How many real niggas will be down for the cause?

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
If rap was illegal, you bitch niggas wouldn't even write a bar
Shit, I'd probably be behind bars
Raising the bar through these bars, I am at the bar
Taking shots of Henny, telling the bartender about all of my flaws
I'm in love with hip-hop not from the allure
I am sure, every single dog gets its day on the cross
No labels telling me fables, bitch, I am my own boss
Stoned off Triple OG, watch me zone off
Supreme entity, public enemy, energy that I'm harvesting
In pursuit of the riches, I want more green than them army men figures
So much 'shrooms and acid that my thoughts
Are tangled and twisted like gangbanger fingers
Right before they flick on the trigger and dismantle your ligaments
Metal fragments will hit you, so many holes in a nigga
That when the wind blows, he whistles, bet that I could read your mental
With my finger on temple and learn the deepest
Darkest secrets that your shadow will tell you
Cause you heard that I'm a better beast and stay closer to jay like a memory
And if your eyes ain't bloodshot, you need to get some better weed
Screaming, what the bloodclot? Shotty in a stolen V
Follow the law? I don't even follow the lord, flexing
Like I just shot up a bottle of 'roids, sexing
Bad exotic chick on top of your boy, chip on my shoulder
Only if chips involved, motherfucker

[Outro: Sample]
"I see you got yourself a little business going. Well, that's good, that's good, when you make that paper, but when you making paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it. You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter. There's two types of niggas in this world: there're niggas with guns and niggas with butter. Now what are guns? The guns, that's the real estate. There's stocks and bonds, artwork, you know shit that appreciates with value. What's the butter? Cars, clothes, jewelry, all that other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it. That's what it's all about, guns and butter baby! Lil' dumb motherfuckers"



[Intro]
Police were forced to open fire on a naked man who refused to stop chewing the face off of another man,clearly was on a very powerful drug

[Verse 1: L.S. Darko]
Excuse me, America, I don't do the taxes
I make my money flip, stretch, we call it gymnastics
It's fucking Friday, I need a Nia Long
With a nice set of tits and a green thong
Me and Juicy always smoking, we like Cheech Chong
A French bitch, pussy sweet, honey Dijon
She love the paper, everywhere the cash be
Now baby girl, pop that pussy like some acne
I must be balling cause she only fuck with athletes
I'm that deep, smoking purple in a black tee
I love weed nigga, I got a green thumb
She fuck me nigga, until she bleed cum
Your favorite crew will be on milk cartons soon
I'm busting off in the ocean like a harpoon
Yeah, money green nigga, so they envy
A gat on me with a beam for the enemy
Kush and codeine, now I lean like the Italy
Tower of Pisa nigga, a pretty diva with us
Her body is magnifique, I call her Mona Lisa
Oh yeah, and she barely speak, she only roll the reefer
I'm smoking super kush, good god, I'm super high
Bumpin' Ready to Die—feelin' ready to die
Like I done seen death (I did), shit, you ain't seen yet
With there is no hate, and you don't need flesh
A bright idea, you can see me in the nighttime
Got weed, a bitch, a pack of rubbers, and some white wine
Got left behind cause you wasn't in your right mind
Lost all your paper cause you wasn't in the right grind
I put my dick between her tits, now we Siamese
Fucked her on the floor so I won't mess up my designer sheets
Made her pussy fart, burp, cough, her vagina speak
She suck away the pain and strain her brain like it's finals week

[Verse 2: L.S. Darko]
Perfect day, ten bitches, some sour diesel
Eleven coffins, my flow ugly awesome, you hear this shit
And get lost and eventually I have a fortune
That'll be awesome
Getting hand-painted portraits of me getting my balls licked
Pump-action shotty that will shoot off your door hinge
Dusting weed by the ton, nigga needed forklifts
Razor blade under my tongue while I spit this raw shit
Y'all niggas should forfeit



[Verse 1]
My name calling all night
I can pull the wool while I'm being polite
Like, darling calling all night
I can be a bull while I'm being polite
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
I know many women want to be in my life
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
Why can't every woman end up being my wife?

My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 1]
Oh Bambi I won't lie
If I weren't in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling you would be love of my life
Oh Bambi it's my design
To run the jungle I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

[Chorus]
Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
‘Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes
I'm terrified you were love of my life
The women among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry
‘Cause now they know you are love of my life

[Chorus]
Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 3]
I wish that we were forever young
I always knew that this day would come
The fork in the road where I cannot run
Between loving many and loving one
I got the wedding invitation Bambi
I'm happy that he wants to make a family
But I cannot promise I won’t run up in the church there screamin’ your name Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi

[Chorus]
Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

Niggas fighting over rings
Niggas wanna be the King, but
Long Live the Chief
For a li' ol' thang lil' boys bang bang
Long Live the Chief
Niggas fighting over rings
Niggas wanna be the king, but
Long Live the Chief
Yeah watch pretty mama while I slang my cane
Long Live the Chief
Uh

[Verse]
Cockroaches and the rat shit
Hand me downs with the patches
Mama put a little money in the mattress
Taught me how to make a silver spoon out of plastic
You can either sink, swim or be the captain
Get the last word I'mma get the last laugh in
Now they say "Jidenna why you dressing so classic?"
I don’t want my best dressed day in a casket
You can either lead, follow or get out the way
Make a fuckin' move it would make my fuckin' day
Got a 100 year plan you jus' think about today
Always been about time more than been about pay
Can't rump with me
Usain couldn’t run with me
Chief come to find you
You don’t come for me
At best you can run a lil' company
Nigga at worst, I could run the whole country
That's right - pimp game like a brothel 
That's why - I don’t judge a nigga's hustle 
I Airbnb the crib like a hostel 
Summer rate cheaper 'cause the streets get hostile
Shaka boy, this fire from Mojave boy
So no I won’t record for your homie boy 
I turn the party out like a naughty toy
Then I go and hide in plain sight like a lobby boy
Yessuh, that's Jidenna on the banner
Ridin' for my niggas gettin' locked up in the slammer
Elders saying everything's a nail to a hammer
And niggas can’t spell but we know our Instagrammar
Well done's better than well said
I read niggas well, a nigga well read
Really I ain't met nobody smarter
That's why I got admitted but I still rejected Harvard
I’m the fresh prince, in a school where they couldn’t read
Mama put me in a school with the Kennedys
When I met Bill Clinton I was seventeen
But dead presidents is all my niggas need
Dining with the governor's daughter
And her father say I remind him of Obama
I’m the chief diplomat...every day
And I’m black and white...Janelle Monae

[Hook]
Niggas fighting over rings
Niggas wanna be the King, but
Long Live the Chief
For a li' ol' thang lil' boys bang bang
Long Live the Chief
Niggas fighting over rings
Niggas wanna be the king, but
Long Live the Chief
Now watch pretty mama while I slang my cane
Long Live the Chief

Until I'm stupid rich and now I'm stupid rich, ah

(Classic man) That's on my mama though
I got piranha flow, fuckin' up your designer clothes
(Casket man) Where be your rapper's angle?
Bunch of subliminal bitches, I'd rather fingerbang 'em
Oh, ke-mo sah-bee, pray to God nobody try me
Catch a body over nothin, Top couldn't even stop me
I got key to my city, I got key to California
I might legalize your homicide and more marijuana
Let my daddy smoke his weed, only thing they keep me friendly
I ain't got no jewelry on me, bitch, I got the jewelry in me
Oh, shit, let me talk my shit, I always been the shit
This ain't overnight, they love me now like they loved me then
I know what I like, I eat the pussy for my nourishment
I know how to cherish it
I know how to decorate your wall and further furnish it
I'ma burn your shit down, this is what the furnace is
I'ma turn your shit around wit' some friendly services
Ain't no nervousness like I'm ratchet or conservative
And that's affirmative
All I do is lay-up and face up my big bills and pay stub
Got no chill for fake ones, like, for real, they say I'm...

[Intro]
Let yo booty do that yoga

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Party at the beach down in Copacabana
Sipping Killepitsch, got my black yoga pants on
Me and Brittany, we’ve been down in Atlanta
Sweating in the club, call me Dirty Diana
Flexing like a yogi, drop it down with your hands up
Do a handstand, bend it back, put your legs up
I ain’t got no worries, I’m my own private dancer
My own private dancer

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)

[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe]
Crown on my head, but the world on my shoulder
I'm too much a rebel, never do what I’m supposed ta
Bend it never break it, baby watch and I’ma show ya
Stretching on my cash, got my money doing yoga
Sometimes I'm PG, and sometimes I'm vulgar
Even when I’m sleeping, I got one eye open
You cannot police me, so get off my areola
Get off my areola

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)

[Verse 3: Jidenna]
I said yoga, she did that yoga
Looking for my loafers, man I woke up in a toga
She left my collar on like she my owner
So when she downward dog, I jump up on her
I lo-lo-love the way you bend
Oh Lord, I’d love to break you in
Oh Lord, I’d stretch you out and in
Oh Lord, now you should tell a friend
Oh Lord, I pray, pray, I pray they come, come, come on over
And let they bum-bum do that yoga

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga
Flex it (yoga)
Flex it (yoga)

[Outro]
Let yo booty do that yoga



[Chorus]
Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga...", again
Never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything..."

[Verse 1]
Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinking that they fucking with J.I.D, ya'll got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
"Oh, my God, don't be mean to me"
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in the way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Ya'll niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (kingpin? You a pen king)
Bye bye niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

[Chorus]
Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you..."

[Beat Switch]
"Uhh... let's go."

[Verse 2]
Yeah... yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the key, we can plan something
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love J.I.D, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than J.I.D, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

[Outro]
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful

Act One: Scene 4

[Chorus]
Yeah, run, Ricky, run, run, nigga, run, jump, nigga, jump
Come here they come, run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga done

[Verse]
Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a son, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plant, please come with a strip
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, J.I.D like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down this my brother brother shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting but I get it
I'm full attention, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And you dumb, dumb better run, run cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fire, get 'em nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck wit you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

[Chorus]
Yeah, run Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump nigga, jump
Come here they come run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga-



[Intro: J. Cole]
Yo, I'm in Atlanta, bruh
Hit me back, lil' nigga

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now elevate my status to Gucci bags
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And yes them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lector lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slapped stupid
East side little Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm astoundin', stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
Niggas ain't seein' you Venus, shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills, my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my delivery
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine nigga
Hah, now elevate my status to Gucci bags
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And yes them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now elevate my status to Gucci bags
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harassers
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And yes them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Outro]
If you want to act up
If you want to act up
Come act up



[Intro]
Olualuweaway
Uweaway
No the chief don't run
The chief don't
No the chief don't run

[Hook]
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run

[Verse 1]
Before the red cups and the backwoods smoke
Me and mom in the shack in the woods, bro
I was sleepin' on the floor with the oven door open
While I dreamt about the places that I would go
We would go door to door to door all day
We were begging 'em to lay up in the foyer
I was sittin' with the hookers in a motel hallway
Waiting onna blind audition like it's Broadway
Now these Madams looking like a fleet of foxes
Rat Pack chief of staff like Sinatra
Eat, drink, swank, nigga that's the mantra
Betta stand when I speak, nigga, fix your posture
Chief don't run, baby, word to poppa
Wanted me to-be-a lawyer, engineer or doctor
The new Godfather, keep your old mobsters
Matter fact, you can keep your old Oscars
It's tomorrow never dies now
I'm on yacht with a prince in Dubai now
I'm with the Dalai Lama's homies in the sky lounge
Cocktails got me loosenin' my tie now
They say a prophet never honored in his homeland
That's fine, I'd rather have my own land
Gotta plan for a hundred Roman numerals
Long live the chief, nigga, welcome to your funeral

[Hook]
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run

[Verse 2]
It's my time, hit the gong out here
They gon' need to build a bigger wall out here
I live a different set of laws out here
Know my rights even when I'm in the wrong out here
Look what we did with one song out here
Like a locksmith opened every door out here
Ya dealing with a king, not a kong out here
You a pawn, but we can get along out here
You in my house actin' too free though
We know you foul—nigga, two free throws
Chiefy, chiefy in a new chief cloak
I ain't even said a word, but my suit bespoke
I got a new agenda that gotta carry through
When your father's enemies are tryna bury you
And the royal families are tryna marry you
Long live the chief, nigga
Welcome to your burial

[Hook]
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run
Oh the chief don't run

[Post-Hook]
Everybody wanna run, they don't want it like us
Paid my dues, but they still tryna Wesley Snipe-us
Tell me why we gon' still win tonight
Breakin' bread, we got everybody right



[Intro]
It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Niggas don't want war—I'm a martian, with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts—like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit—'bout to inaugurate
My P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame-spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go
"Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom"
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K
Like every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is, "Pray"
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, "You're so right"
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

[Interlude]
Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E., Public Enemy, Assassinate us—bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of fine of interest for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', "Fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond—nigga

[Intro: DJ Premier cuts]
Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo-mo-money ain't a thing if I got it
Money

[Hook]
Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough

[Verse 1]
Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

[Verse 2 (DJ Premier cuts)]
Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (Joey Badass)
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all

[Hook]
Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough

Mother—
Mother—sucker, yeah
Oh, this is what you want, huh?
Dmm—dmm, dmm, dmm, dm-dmm, dmm
Dmm—dmm, dmm, dmm, dm-dmm, dmm
Dmm—dmm, dmm, dmm, dm-dmm, dmm
Microphone-checker (Checker, checker, checker, checker...)
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
Uh—motherfuckin' microphone-checker
Keep that grip tight, like my Smith & Wesson
Ike with the mic, which nigga tryna turn up?
Hit you with the hurtful fuckin' truth like Sojourner
Motherfuckin' microphone eater
Spittin' hot shit, hit ya dome with the heater
Wouldn't want to be ya, dish lyrical fajitas
Got dragon balls like my name was Vegeta
Motherfuckin' super duper swankin'
Niggas still hatin', pigs want him for the bacon
Take 'em to the slaughterhouse, say we 'bout to order out
Tell 'em we the badass motherfuckers that they heard about
Yes, I guess the word is out, we comin' for the top dollar
Top rottweiler, since I popped my collar
Niggas say they hit us, they ain't ever shot nada
Me? I'd rather not snitch up on my own problems
Cause I'm a microphone killer
Especially when my head is gone off the liquor
Specially educated, heavily medicated
Give me that beat and I'll put you next to Dilla (My nigga)
Flow sweeter than vanilla
Tell these haters beat it, can't Jackson thriller
I'm the nigga that you see when you're in the mirror
Say my name five times, this what I deliver

[Hook]
This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal Flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga

[Bridge]
Which one of y'all niggas really want it with me?
None of y'all niggas, fuck outta here
Beast coast, nigga, Pro Era in your area

[Hook]
This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal Flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga

[Outro]
Niggas know, niggas, niggas, niggas know



[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Check it, word word
What's the word word
Yeah, check!

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wilding, he look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playing is the banned violence
No lying niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye 'em they get the wrong message, wrong methods
Put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me, "More dress-up"—I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm putting in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like "they gon' catch up" fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressing and shine, it's fine

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and whatnot
The motto never changed it’s still fuck cops
We went from having lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs was hot whenever we'd puff pot
We'd touch blocks and end up having to duck shots
But fuck dot, ain’t trying live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can’t be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest’s opinion, knock the hinges off of Heaven’s gates
Trying to share my cells with my mate, not share a cell with mates
Wrecking shit with my recklessness
The L get lit that’s when I start second guessing shit
Thinking 'bout Ty and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could’ve fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I’m street so cross me like pedestrians
And that’s gon' be the end of it, straight revoking your membership

[Hook: CJ Fly]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Niggas wanna know what I’m about—I’m 'bout blowin' loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spitting behind the bars like a con position
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you I keep my attitude on "screw it a million bucks should do it"
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me, who the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat, fuck math
Teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions
Reaching, all time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked watching out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis
Smoking on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg
My folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka

[Hook: Joey BadA$$]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this



[Intro]
Yeah, you remember back in the days
When niggas used to rock waves and shit?
When like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
And that's real shit

[Verse 1]
Uhh, since '9-5, momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful
Will have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin tofu
Like I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin "What happened?"
But back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em, "Who's Joey Bad?"
Watch em gasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal
Uh, and they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north
Speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss, no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes
Yeah

[Interlude: 2Pac sample]
What the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person
You know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A
I'm coming at 'em 100% real, I ain't compromising nothin'
Anybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'
It's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world
And I'm being real about it and I'mma grow with my music

[Verse 2]
Yeah, but it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
'Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like three times, have three kids, I hope
Me & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge
Cause yeah, they gon need it
Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, cause my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine
Imagine, I'ma make it all happen



[Produced by Lee Bannon]

[Verse 1]
And we smoking, toking potent herb
Preaching spoken words that just might poke your nerves
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned
(Oh, you salty)
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard
I drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me

[Hook]
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

[Verse 2]
Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun
Recollect and collect the funds
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum
'99, 'til infinity beyond
Hold my peace full of energy 'til enemies be gone
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone
Peep the melody we on
But they don't know the remedy to these songs
Basic necessities on how to be put on
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know
Whose shoulder we leaning on
But all we do is show them who we leading on

[Hook]
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

[Verse 3]
Cause they will never stop for a young black male
Blackmailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars Evel Knievel
I see through people's door, the world may never know
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties
Gold soul theory, but what is life really

[Hook]
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time



[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Look, I ain't gotta force it
This that youngest on the 30 Under Forbes list (that Forbes list)
Yeah, I be cashin' out, I be cashin' out (money)

Hey, told the world about it, ain't no secret (secret)
You niggas worried 'bout the crown, worried 'bout the crown (worried)
Fuck it, you can tell them clowns they can keep it (they can keep it)

I've been a wolf and I kill the sheep
Gotta pray on the prey for my enemies
'Cause they wanna feed off my energy (yeah, yeah)
Lyrically no one ahead of me
I could die today, still leave a legacy
That you can't ever be
Put that on everything, this is my destiny
It was all meant to be, fuck is you tellin' me?
You ain't 'bout nothin'
With my niggas, we flexin' and stuntin'
'Cause we had to work harder, was hustlin'
Play your card 'cause we know that you bluffin' (yeah, hey)
I got two cars, nigga, two cribs
Big body and a little Benz
Triplex on my own land
And I paid bills before a grown man (that's right)
That's on my mama, stackin' plenty commas
Got good karma like the Dalai Lama (yeah)
I'm tailor-made for this, buy designer
Bitch, I'm the nigga, just to remind you, yeah (hey)

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
To remind you, to remind you

Shots fire, make a nigga run, man (fire, fire)

Feel a nigga mind, see a nigga grind
Fuckin' gold mine of a mind

Fightin' birds in the damn sky 'cause I'm damn fly–

[Interlude: XXXTENTACION & Joey Bada$$]
Ayy, ayy Joey, ayy Joey, I'm just... I'm just gon' stop rapping

[Intro]
Yeah, can you feel it? (yeah)

[Chorus]
I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)

Okay, just gettin' better each day

Look up to the Lord, we pray, tryna be my best each day
And 'til I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah
'Til the time bein', we lit
Hopin' I don't let it get all in my head
I don't need the money just to say that I'm rich
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed
But they used to run from me when I had nothin'
Now they want to fuck 'cause they see me stuntin'
Nigga came up off the hustlin'
Livin' in the lap of lux and I'm feelin' like the man
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand
Homie, 'bout these rubberbands on me
Make her wanna dance for me
Prolly leave her man for me, standin' in the stands, goddamn
(She used to front way back, now she just a fan, yeah)

[Chorus]
I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)

So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes
I put my pain in the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

And all that ever took was patience



[Intro]
Yeah, you know sometimes I think
They don't truly understand me, you know
Cause they don't, yeah, uh

[Bridge]
Can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire actions in your first child
I'll begin my verse now

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
They built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives

[Chorus]
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last names of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah

[Bridge]
We can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action, hold up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition

[Chorus]
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last name of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah

[Bridge]
We can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action in your first child, yeah



[Intro]
We done came up
Everybody love ‘em
On the regular

[Verse 1]
Lookin’ at popular colored faces
Observing what my brothers faces in all races
Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G, fuck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I’m a Brooklyn nigga, basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures, don’t worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
Imma spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops
Why settle for a office spot?
Niggas don’t always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ - let me guess: that’s your mannequin?
Leave ‘em shook while you’re standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'
This is for my real hip hop fans and ‘em
I dispose for 'em, leave fake MC’s in the post mortem

[Chorus]
Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

[Verse 2]
It ain’t easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain’t hard to be disloyal
Comin’ straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins
I’m the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering
BMX like Hoffman, BMF like Boss-man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
Bitches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the motherland, but I’ve got the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can’t understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber band

[Chorus]
Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

[Outro]
Everybody love ‘em
We done came up
I’ma spark it off unorthodox
They don’t feel the name, but they say the music dope though
I’ma spark it off unorthodox
On the regular

My Jewelry glistening why I’m always chilly
Can't believe a nigga made a couple milli'

Gettin' bread like a crouton

Bare Raf when I wear Raf
Might invest into some Raf shares
Lil' niggas still share Raf

Wouldn't sign ya if I had a label
That designer on a nigga label, fuego
Down the bottle, still under the limit
I could buy your bitch just off my debit
I could buy her, not fuck up my credit
Ain't no executives flexin' my blessings
Ain't no middleman cuttin' my blessings
I got all of this flick for the Lord's worship
You ain't slammin', got the Asperger's
I'ma drag that nigga, he deserve it
I'ma read his ass like a LaBeija
Anna Wintour cool with my mama
And it's winter fool, need a bomber
Plate of ravioli at Obama's, right, right, right
Can't you see I'm eating, what's poppin'?
Wrist like ravioli, stuffed with diamonds, right, right?
We don't have the same problems
I get Raf Simons, 'cause I'm gifted
That means, sometimes I get it and don't even want it
Give Raf Simons, when I'm giftin'
That means sometimes I give it, you know that you want it

[Verse 5: Frank Ocean]
Sterling silver lasers (yessir)
Rubies red, my skin too black to blush
This bitch too rare to bust
Seen her in the iPhone pages
This ain't on the Gram, Wizard of OZ
Parka pockets full of med leaf
Guap is smelling like it brush teeth
Say, "Cheese", see the porcelain
Xans and water, see swordfish
Backwoods all forestry
Raf draggin' on the... floor, bitch
Flame thrower in it, in it
I'm torchin' the road in these Gucci flames
Stuck to the pavement, they glued
I'm two-point-five million a venue
And twenty-five hundred a tooth
I'm coatin' my lungs in the muddy

[Intro: Meech]
Ah, it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a zombie, hahaha

[Verse 1: Meech]
The highest high, I'm Ayatollah
Rubber on my dick, allergic to baby strollers
Blue dream, that amazing odor
Ant is a Pyrex, I'm the coke and the baking soda
Juice be the blue flame that create the whole thing
Rap game, crack game, apparently the same thing
If this was eighty-something, I'd be in shell toes
Gucci-link fat rings, ashy ass elbows
Saving every penny trying to get up out this hellhole
For my super thugs, hustling up off the jail phone
Life's a battle, fool, you better have your weapon drawn
How could I be scared of death, bitch, I'm already gone
Money on my mind, your bitch on my zipper
Breaking up pound after pound, THC on every finger
You gon' need a boost from God to get as high as me, nigga
Excuse me, I meant to say as high as we, nigga

[Bridge: Meech]

Three fly ass bitches with we
Double-cupped them double Ds
Hi-high nigga, hi-high living
Three young ass niggas running shit, no slipping
Gotta know the game, gotta know the lane
Gotta know the pain, no handouts, ain't shit easy
Dark shades on my Eazy-E, got bitches on my mini-me
And you niggas in the rap game, can't relate
I'm real pimping, no fornicating
Fuck what you heard, I'm going ape
Smoking Grape Ape, fuck your mixtape
That's a weed plate, Zombie-style
A$AP, never mind these clowns
I love brain, Zombie-style, never mind these clouds

[Interlude: A$AP Ant]
Juice, pass me the weed, Meech, where the acid at?
A$AP Ant in this bitch, uh

[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
I'm a demon, triple-beaming, painting pictures
Raping Mona Lisa, blood sheets, creeping for the panties
With the collar dannys, killing bitches, sniffing panties
Willy Wonka candy semen, three niggas, one bitch, one clip
One brain-dead girl off your mind, leave your brains on your moms
Razor blades dipped in bleach, tear your skin to pieces
Dump the body in Tennessee, highway getaway, OJ bronco
Cap it, baby, drive 'em off the bridge, look into my eyes, vivid tears
I see fear, y'all some fucking queers
Grow a fucking pair, I'm 'posed to be here
'Posed to be dead, overdosed on shrooms
Let's cruise, drive by on-site
Ride like a bike, for my Zombie homies kill tonight

See the Breds made a toast for the honey and the butter
Only die for two things, that's my money and my mother, motherfucker
Niggas know my name, did I stutter?
Niggas know me, man, I keep it one hunna
I'm a stunna, Hood by Air for the summer
Toast to the God and it cost nine hunna
So-so ru-run up if you wanna
Mac in the backpack, right by the Macbook
And I rep that Harlem
And my Zombie niggas straight out of Flatbush



[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brr, brr, brr, brr
Ring, ring, ring, post man
Who this?

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Telephone call from young Carti, said, "It's lit."
Call the young Lord, A$AP Bari, he legit
Money clean, young boy, Ian Connor off the shit (Young Lord)
Fuckin' with them boys out of Harlem or the six
This is Gosha, man I pay for pussy? No sir
Ridin' coaster, roller coaster, chauffer

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
I got money bags
I'ma bag your bitch, I'ma buy your bitch
(I got money bags, turn up, turn up)
I'ma cash this shit, I'ma cash this shit
(I got money bags, turn up, turn up)
Cash Carti, bitch, Cash Carti, bitch
(Carti, Carti)
You can have this shit, you can have this shit
(What you want, yo?)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Godfather rap, nappy plaits to the back
James Brown swag, Papa's got a brand-new bag
And I don't know how to act
On or off the record, might go axe
Harlem back up on the map
True New York will knock the Apple out you Jacks
Pop your Snapple cap, pop facts
Gucci and Dior biddin' wars
Who wore the piece before they hit the floor?
Not even shit you see overseas in stores
Who else but me? I know you seen the Forbes
Commend your boy, I been the Lord
Holy tabernacle, Mr. Smack-Your-Favorite-Rapper
Greedy for the fat guy's platter
Killin' niggas even though black lives matter
Weak stomach, flow make 'em throw up
Steppin' stones, I'm your stepfather
Tell Tyler, better step his flow up
Mix the pour up with the Pepsi Cola
Nextel or the Motorola
Young nigga prolly never grow up
Postman with the telephone, uh

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brr, brr, brr, brr
Ring, ring, ring, postman
Who this?

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck with Taco, fuck with Jasper
Fuck with Lionel, man that shit is gon' get sketchy
Shirt is striped, my shorts are short
My Vans are Vans 'cause Tyler does not fuck with Giuseppe
Fuck the Gucci, fuck the Raf
And fuck the swag and all that other shit they wearin'
Fuck the Rolls and fuck the 'Rari
Fuck the Lambo, Tyler only ride McLaren
Niggas think they really on because they trappin'
Made about like 30 thousand
Fuck the party, threw the carnival
Attendance this year was like 30 thousand
Shoppin', ballin', opal fire diamonds shinin'
Make sure my sapphire's glistenin'
Make the shit, I wear the shit
They cop the shit, it's Golf, you bitch, you niggas trippin'
I'm a businessman, you ain't never been the man
Nigga tax bracket changed, like have you seen my home?
Crib got a tennis court
Get my Venus and Serena on
Golf in this bitch, better ring the doctor
Ambulance come when I hit the scene
That boy flier than a bag of bees
I got my flowers, life's a jeweler
Diamond, fingers size of a tumor
He's a genius, have you heard the rumors?
He's a winner, no not a loser
Fuck passin' blunts, pass my niggas' opportunities
Goddamn, I'm hot, man, I'm not scared to freeze
January, Hawaiian shirts
Boy this weather ain't got a thing on me
Where's the mirror? I'm that nigga
Kunta ain't got much shit on me
'Cause I'm a master, I hit my own back
To be like, "Y'all boys, my nigga"
Fuck that, it's Golf, bitch

[Outro: Yung Gleesh + A$AP Rocky]
Doin' it for Yams, ayy, ayy
I used to do it for the grams, ayy, ayy
That's been way before Instagram, ayy, ayy
I used to serve it to your mans
Postman! Who's this?
Walk, Gleesh, walk
Walk, walk Gleesh, walk
Walk, walk, walk Gleesh, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk

I'm like God in these streets, got a tech in my coat
I go hard in these streets, Johnny Depp with the blow
I flip nickels and O's, I flip powder in bass
I done shoveled the snow, I done showered the state
See them flowers gone grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All these diamonds in my teeth
I'm gone off a gallon of Hennessy
Better let your bitch go cause she's feelin' me
And besides she a ho, she fucked him and me
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
And I blam-blam like you Timberlake
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate
A$AP 'til I die, nigga, period

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
Hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, I got hella hoes

[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yuh, I can't relate, uh, yuh (no)
To none of you, rappers are actors
I swear that these niggas be fake, uh (no, yuh, yuh, ayy)
Fuck out my face (face, fuck out my face)
Yuh, way too much food on my plate for her to be actin' all stank
Yuh, uh, diamonds on bling (bling blaww-blaww)
Yuh, we smoked out, my bitch is so bad
I had to go buy her a mink, whew (mink, ayy)
Fuck what you think, yuh (fuck what you, fuck what you think)
Yeah, 'cause me and the money in love, I think I'ma buy it a ring

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
My diamond's shinin', yours cloudy
Diamond's ice, play hockey
Lean got me feelin' drowsy
Stripper bitch, she work at Follies
Meet me at the hotel lobby
Air Max, runnin' to the money
You ain't takin' nothin' from me
And I'm gon' die 'bout it

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
(Focus...)
From demons, distractions
To all the reactions of fame
She probably collapsin' her heart over taxes
I'm blowin' a kiss on the way
Production big, can't fit on a stage
Too many fans to fit in the crowd
Too many bands to get 'em on stage
His crew and his band is with him on stage
I say in advance, so pay in advance
I'm way too advanced to figure him out
I set the bar, don't give 'em a break
The bar's too high to give it a raise
A flow, like God, so give him a raise
Stones I got, I get 'em appraised
Draw my Glock and get him erased
Flow you got, I give it away

[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yuh, I can't relate, uh, yuh (no, no)
To none of you, rappers are actors
I swear that these niggas be fake, uh (no, yuh, yuh, ayy)
Fuck out my face (face, fuck out my face)
Yuh, way too much food on my plate for her to be actin' all stank

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
'Cause it feels so good when it's you
And it feels so good when it's new
'Cause it feels so good when it's new (ayy)
Why you actin' like you ain't knew?

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Niggarace, new Versace
I be mobbin' with my posse
Stretch that coochie like pilates
I'm gon' eat it like Hibachi
Play no game, no Tamagotchi
Finger froze like Liberace
Fuck that bitch, I make her knock knee
While I rep Trilluminati

[Verse 5: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yah, oh, right
Pelle Pelle, butter soft, we was in 'em lobbies
Holla, holla, steady mobbin', only God can stop me, huh
Dollar signs, a lot of diamonds, I'm about to sign me
Cop a Tommy, yeah, the Tommy
Thousand band like Fauni, yeah
All in the forest, hey
Lookin' for porridge, hey
Ricky in storage, fresh with the chorus
Dressed like a tourist, hey, yeah
That's with the bomber, huh
Fuck up some commas, hey, hmm
Glock for the drama, hey
Do what I want, fuck when I wanna...

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
'Cause it feels so good when it's you
And it feels so good when it's new

Why you actin' like you ain't knew?

Yeah, 'cause me and the money in love, I think I'ma buy it a ring
Yuh (what?)

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 1]
Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
A$AP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Testarossa, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get in and get chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

Nothin' over, nothin' less
And hoes on deck, and plus I flex

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Understand, I'm a man tryna make it in a world of death
She just wanna fuck and I just met her at the club
And now we left
I just wanna fuckin' love her, rough her
She was lovin' nothin' less
I just love how we're bustin'
Nuttin' all up on her fucking chest
God I love that dress
God I love the way she dress, she fresh
God I love her breasts
God I love her thighs and eyes and uhh
Swear to God I'm outta breath
Swear to God if I get out of line, she checkin'
Only time we naked
Only time she complainin' and demand for private jets
Twist my fingers, put that on my set, uh
Fuck the other side, no disrespect, uh
Talking crazy, niggas comin' at my neck
Man, that's word to Skepta, I'ma put that on my set

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Show respect
I'ma aim for the neck
I'ma make some ghosts
When it comes to the raps
Man I must be possessed
When you see me up close
When you look into my eyes
When you see how I flex
Just me and my dogs
And another handful of cats
I ain't tryna fuck with the rest
Man, I'm ready to die
My soul's in the sky
See the pain in my eyes
I don't wanna cry
Put my life on the line
For my blood all the time
I see all the signs
But it's like they blind
Tryna kill me for mine
Now this all behind
The police tryna find
DNA on the nine
Man, open the door
Real niggas on tour
Man, I'm ready for war
Ten toes on the floor
Fuck with me on the 3rd
It will be Halloween on the 4th
Yeah, all the way from the East to the North
Rocky billin' up that Backwood
Spilling mad weed on the floor, icy

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Need that on my set, eyy, eyy

They called baguettes, these bitches sweat
These niggas know, they all in check
And hoes on deck
And plus I flex, I put that on my set

[Verse 1]
12 in the mornin', pop shells for a livin'
And berry gon' smell blood trail every minute
Rogue wave on you niggas, no fail when I hit 'em
Every time I see a pig, I don't hesitate to kill 'em
Ain't nobody give a fuck about a rule
Either get diplomas or a tool, I'ma cool with my youngins
No bool when I'm sprayin' this K at you fuckas
Fuck a gang affiliated with nothin' but my name

[Chorus]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do', yeah

[Verse 2]
People be starvin'
And people be killin' for food with that crack and that spoon
But these rich mothafuckas, they stay eatin' good
Droppin' wage livin' good
Holdin' steel Glocks, but you been a bitch, suck a thick cock
Fuck a Crip walk, hit the strip like in Bangkok
Never ever see me have a trip ‘bout a lil’ broad
See me on the TV screamin', "Bitch, you a damn fraud"
And you don't wanna fuck with a chigga like me
When I pull up in that Maserati
Better duck 'fore ya brain splatter on the concrete
I'ma hit you with that .45, bullet hit yo neck round the bow tie
Lookin' like a thriller, film a bitch
I'ma go right back with the clip and I know you be shakin'
Don't test me or I might just click at yo noggin

[Chorus]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo' motherfuckin' do', yeah



[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers (yuh)

[Post-Chorus]
I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

[Verse 1]
Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Verse 2]
All these parties I attend
But never know the celebration
I let you do what you want
No need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin' 'bout the things that you pursue

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…



[Verse 1]
Yo' bitch on me but you can never do nothing
'Cause yo' momma raised a pussy
Everytime I walk to the drop top, can't help but
Close my eyes 'cause my whip so glossy
God damn, bitch, I don't smoke no gas
I don't pop no Xans,  hella cake
I just need that ass, don't worry 'bout no mans
Look at me, look at he, you don't wanna fuck with we
Hit the streets, roll on me, you gon' end up in the sea

[Bridge 1]
7:30, wake up, skrt up in the lobby then proceed to flee
All my people ridin' in the backseat on a killin' spree
Wait, who that be, ready on the count of 3
Squeeze the G, leave the scene
Bouncin' like the trampoline

[Hook]
Gettin' bread, earn income (man)
Spent it on this Balmain
Working all night I might run into the Batman
I don't see no such thing as a mothe'fuckin' bro, mane
You ain't fuckin' slick if you think you in my team, mane

[Verse 2]
We gon' pull up on the kids with a flat brim cap and the tats get the  brick
And I don't give a fuck hit em with the damn dicks
Man, hold up, pause, now they red like Santa Claus
I'm a G bet there's something wrong with me
All these mans on the ground, lookin like the dead ass sea
Yeah, pull up on me, sip a high-t, till I OD
I don't really give a fuck no more b
Skrrt skrrt onamonapee, bitch Grand Prix
Pull up on a fuckin enemy, 3rd degree
Now imma go right back to the crib (to the crib bitch)
And leave the fuckin country with the brick (loudpack)

[Bridge 2]
I'd call the cops on myself if I can, (if I can)
This shit too crazy need the fuckin ambulance (ambulance)
Don't wear no jackets, I just wear that metal vest (skrrt skrrt)
Got all this money but these bitches unimpressed (yea, yea, yea)

[Hook]
Getting bread earn income (man)
Spend it on this Balmain
Working all night I might run into the Bat(man)
I don't see no such thing as a motherfucking bro mane
You ain't fucking slick if you think you in my team mane

[Bridge 1]
7:30 wake up skrt up in the lobby then proceed to flee
All my people riding in the back seat on a killing spree
Wait, who that be? ready on the count of 3
Squeeze the G, leave the scene
Bouncin like the trampoline
Yeah

[Verse 3: Rich Chigga]
Uh, ayy, yuh
Born in '99 and I got 99 chicks in my crib (ayy, what?)
X got out the Pen, I knew about it from his fuckin' team (ayy)
Only make this shit then when you listen, you gon' fuckin' quit
Not from Florida but they like, "He go hard, he just a jit" (buh, ayy)
On my dick, ayy, why you on my dick?
Swear, last week, you wasn't fuckin' with me
Now you tryna click (ayy)
Wait, bitch, please do not make me wait
I fly over to your state (ayy)
Don't be lyin' like the mothafuckin' cake, uh (ayy)
20/20 vision, still not fuckin' with it
Every move I make, I do with precision
Everybody tryna get on a song
But what is the purpose when I'm not the feature?
Woah, tryna be the GOAT but I just see them walkin' by my door
Make the country proud, I got the governor wearin' all my clothes



[Verse 1]
Saw a car crash, it remind me of our first date
Then I went back, got massages at that one place
Always brought friends but today I feel like doin' this shit alone
Callin' my dad when I wanna hear some wisdom
Callin' my cab alcohol up in my system
Saw a fist fight and that shit don't even make me scared no more
Man, I never been the one to be alone
All my friends are always hittin' up my phone
Every day is spent with everybody, never on my own
But today I'm by myself and I don't even feel alone
Like to smoke cigs every time I feel the outside
Like to play chicks but get mad when they get new guys
You don't get me but I don't blame you, I don't get myself
Pressin' on keys, got my life so sweet man
GoFundMe on your bitch's pinned tweet man
Bumpin' oldies as I try to dick her down
She said give it to me now, and I can't help but listen
She go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"
Slippery sign all over my door
Show some attitude and bitch I won't show
Expectation high, I feel like a drone
2018, I got some new goals
Not checkin' my statement 'til I got 4 mill
Rushin' all year like I commit roadkill
Killin' everybody like I'm in a wrong deal
Do triple checks on every move I make
Work 'til I'm tired then sip on some latte
Only do shit if we do it my way
Everything gon' depend on what I say
3, 4

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hold up, wait a second
Man, my flow on lethal weapon
Hit 'em with the rhymin' pattern
Put these rappers under pressure
This feel like Armageddon
If she witcha I'ma get her
Cut you off like Jerry Heller
She gon' need another fella, ayy
I don't take drugs, I just take naps
Find another girl to eat up like I hate snacks
Dick gon' make her choke like reflux, gotta relax
Man, yo' shit is borin' and it's makin' me go sleep fast
And I always care 'bout everybody but myself
That's the life of a Virgo, never gettin' mad
That's not the Brian that we know
I just weighed my heart, it's about 30 kilos
I just fucked a lady and she 'bout 30 years old
Rappin' on this instrumentals, feelin' like a hero
Never usin' triplet flows because I'm not a Migo
Only lastin' longer 'cause I'm drunk, I don't think she knows
Only thing that matters that my dick is like my ego
They wishin' I'ma fail
These days, no picnics, ain't no fun and games
Still, motherfuckas always got a lot to say
Never got love, so they spreadin' all this hate oh, oh
Man they always actin' real tough
But I show up for a show and they just wanna leave town
People sayin' that my words are colder than the winter
It's Brian, not Brita, so I'll never have a filter



Part I

[Intro: Kris Wu]
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, oh it's a vibe
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, vibe

[Verse 1: Kris Wu]
When I jump into the temple (when I)
Prefer a local mental
Bending knees and wishing place inside to hide low, go
Took a beer I need a 这个beat让你倒地
能力超出你底线
帮助你觉醒
或是打听你的一字一句
都已经到期
都是我玩具
都对我赞许
所以才会把你领地占据
Yeah, like I'm running the game (game)
Don't you fuck with my fame
Light it up, spark it up, burn it into flames
I'm the one and only motherfucker from the East
All them bitches lining up to feel me, spit it then I peace
Gettin' in my zone (gettin')
I do this shit alone (I do)
I'm the Yeezus of the East
You need to Watch the Throne (yeah)

[Chorus: Kris Wu]
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I’ll be on your labels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'
When you peep me, I’m at the top
Ayy, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'
I ain’t never, ever doubt what I’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I be fallin' but they see me flyin'

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah, tell your chick I like her, take it on my Leica
And I'm always stacking paper, but my name ain't Michael
Got a crib in Indo, it's tall just like the Eiffel
I could get her number if I put it on my rider (yuh)
God damn legit, told me that she liked my fit
When I take her out to dinner, man, the check ain't gettin' split
Don't look like I'm getting thinner with the chickens and the ribs
Man, your bitch is what I say
One day, I saw her and got the kiss
Don’t say my name, I never wanna breathe your air
Coke and Kool-Aid, there’s just some shit you don’t compare
I got a x-ray and I just saw my old girl there
She was my ex babe, but now I really just don’t care
I'm so tired, but my mind is racin'
Fuck with me and see what kinda problems you'll be facin'
Friday 13th, I make you look like you met Jason
Like a damn femur poppin', just what I’ve been cravin'

[Chorus: Kris Wu]
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I’ll be on your levels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'
When you peep me, I’m at the top
Ayy, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'
I ain’t never, ever doubt what I’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I be fallin' but they see me flyin'

Part II

[Chorus: Joji]
They said that I won't make it
They said that I won't change
They say that I'm not flexin' (Pow-pow-pow)
Now they say wow, you've changed (skrrt)
Now they say why you change
Now they say why you changin'
Yeah, they ask why you've changed
When the rest ain't looking like me

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
(Fourteen and Seventeen)
No way, no way, stay the same
Got that purple in my vein
It ain't hard to feel their pain
While I'm rocking Saint Laurent
Purple body like a Saint
Ooh, big body coupe just like a tank
I'm just swerving, smoking on some dank
I'm just tryna fucking ease the pain
‘Fore I blow my mind like Kurt Cobain
No I won't change
No I won't change
No I won't change
Yeah, and I promise I won't change
And I promise I'm the same
Trippie Redd, you know my name
Bitch, they say that I'm insane
I might blow your fucking brain
Bitch, I'm fly just like a crane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
And that bitch got angel wings
And just spitting all these flames
And it just 'nnihilate the lames
And it annihilate the lames

[Chorus: Joji]
They said that I won't make it
They said that I won't change
They say that I'm not flexin' (Pow-pow-pow)
Now they say wow, you've changed (skrrt)
Now they say why you change
Now they say why you changin'
Yeah, they ask why you've changed
When the rest ain't looking like me

[Outro: Joji]
Ooh, call my name
Spit at your feet
'Cause I'm alone
Don't call my name
Need some sleep
And sing along



[Intro]
Yeah, happy birthday to me
I'm 18 now
And women can legally have sex with me
Shout out Based God

[Chorus]
I be ridin' right down Melrose with a thicky named Rose
Sittin' on my lap, but she just tryna be my friend, though
Bumpin' on that XO and I'm 'bout to call my ex ho
Mommy, daddy home, I barely see them like a rainbow

[Verse 1]
You can't get rid of me, I ain't goin' nowhere
And I'm always multiplyin' like I always fornicate
Cake, cake up on this belt, the day I landed in the States
Doin' one take all day and I'm just spittin' out the mace (mace)
She like sippin' out that mason jar
She a hippie, she gon' suck for some granola bars
Little freaky got me curious like I'm on Mars
Sayin', I forgot my roots, goddamn, you went too far

[Bridge]
Ayy, damn you went too far
Got these people all around me, man, that treat me like a star
Dressed like I don't give a damn, but I be ballin' like LaVar
Gotta wait about three years, until I could go to the bar

[Verse 2]
Damn, make all my own shit, I get all the profits
If you actin' lazy, then do not expect your props, bitch
Movin' with the tactics, got Gildan on my fabrics
Go ham on the mic, just like I'm sitting in the cockpit, ayy
Used to hate the camera, now your boy's a natural
Now your boy is on the road two months and I'ma get the load
Try to put me in a box, I'm gon' always break the lock
Call me D-Wayne, 'cause she licking on my Johnson like The Rock
Oh my God, man, his voice so deep, I thought he was 21 plus
Brian be so clean, wanna let him spank on my bum
He just turned 18, but for him, I'd catch a case, damn (hold up)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayy, that was the sound of yo' bitch
And everybody that heard what I did
I don't like being so ignorant
But you gon' make me go back to my bullshit again

[Chorus]
I be ridin' right down Melrose with a thicky named Rose
Sittin' on my lap, but she just tryna be my friend, though
Bumpin' on that XO and I'm 'bout to call my ex ho
Mommy, daddy home, I barely see them like a rainbow



[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Yeah, wake up about, uh, 6
Think 'bout money, then 'bout this
I got nothin' on my wrist but I'll still gladly take your bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Who produced that beat? (yeah, ayy, yuh)
Yessiree I did, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Rich Brian]
Got that ass on me
Sound like I'm from New York City
Airbnb, gon' fuck in it
She know that I do the music (music)
Always cook at home, I'm tryna to save up
Tryna do my friends some favors
Gave her head, she facin' backwards (backwards, ayy)

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
27 shows, I go through cities every now and then
I watch the crowd, they jumpin', watchin' me (watchin' me)
Cut, cut to days ago
I'm just a kid not old enough to smoke a cig
They wonder, "What's the recipe?" (ayy, recipe)
They want me to come home
I can hear the drum roll
But understand I'm out here for a reason
Li-livin' in my own home
Father miss me, I know
But also he know that I'm on a mission (mission)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I got diamonds on my fist and shit
Diamonds on my wrist and shit
So icy, bitch, I'm colder than a freezer (bling-blaow)
My main bitch bitchin' (21), side bitch trippin'
Bitch I love ya'll both but none of y'all ain't no keepers
I'll leave ya, Rolls Royce look like Jeepers Creepers (21)
Made a million dollars with Adidas (21)
Can't have a ticket, nigga, off my beeper (21)
Take this shit to trial, nigga, I'm gon' beat it
Spilt my lean, it got me heated
Say it one time, I don't repeat it
Baby, get down on your knees and eat it, (wow) eat it, eat it
Walking out of Louis V with the big box
Yeah I pulled at Saint Laurent, I made a pit stop
Young Savage walk around with the big Glock (21)
With that .30 hangin' out, nigga that's hip-hop (facts)
Car too fast, 12 can't stop me (skrrt)
Bitch too bad, hoes can't fuck me (21)
You was running from the smoke, nigga, not me (on God)
Rich Chigga, 21 Savage, now it's O.D. (21)

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Yeah, wake up about, uh, 6
Think 'bout money, then 'bout this
I got nothin' on my wrist but I'll still gladly take your bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Who produced that beat? (yeah, ayy, yuh)
Yessiree I did, ayy

[Verse 3: Rich Brian]
She act like a bird
I wear shit made out of fur
Your man say he getting money
Claim that he's entrepreneur
Fast car like Fast & Furious
She throw it back, DeLorean
I'm sittin' in somebody's BMW recordin' this
Not my whip, not my whip
Rather walk or take a Lyft
On a trip, I hit the strip
That made me sad and then I dip
Ayy, Brian learnin' how to live it (damn)
People 'round him go in circles
Head is spinnin' with no fidget (recipe)
Used to play the drums though
Never liked it, no, no
Lil' Brian didn't see the bigger picture
Rap-rap on my own beats so
One hundred percent goes
Straight to my li'l pockets and I keep it

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
Yeah, wake up about, uh, 6
Think 'bout money, then 'bout this
I got nothin' on my wrist but I'll still gladly take your bitch (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Who produced that beat? (yeah, ayy, yuh)
Yessiree I did, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Rich Brian]
Got that ass on me
Sound like I'm from New York City
Airbnb, gon' fuck in it
She know that I do the music (music)
Always cook at home, I'm tryna to save up
Tryna do my friends some favors
Gave her head, she facin' backwards (backwards, ayy)



[Verse 1]
Never worry 'bout a single hatin motherfucker
Lookin like my next supper, all these moves that I'm makin got people talkin
Like how many papers is this man signin, I'm back wit the backpack rap
Man I'm thinkin that this shit finna make them scat, got a bag full of cash if we talkin bout that
Run run it like Forrest Gump can you feel that, ay
I'm a renaissance man, if you wanna get a feat you not gon get response man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan
Don't be jealous don't be rude go back to rollin up grams
People think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (damn)

[Hook]
Ballin only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin up that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

[Post-Hook]
Always sayin no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

[Verse 2]
You got cash, buy sum chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
("who the fuck is Zac?" "high school musical")
Bitch hold my stacks I'm 30 minutes late to France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance, better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me thru this day, sippin on Bombay, I dont trust you gotta take this survey
Man I don't look back, never cut no slack, better get way back, fore yo ass get smacked uhh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho, never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow, always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

[Hook]
Ballin only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin up thats just the everyday routine
All my old my friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit em with no vaseline

[Post-Hook]
Always sayin no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie



[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just wanna know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Sittin' in my crib thinkin' 'bout shit
That I never done, but I wish I did
Actin' like I'm fine, but I'm losin' it
Coulda kissed that girl, but it ain't relevant
Coulda made that move, I'm regrettin' it
Feelin' so low, like I'm on 2%
Been livin' life like it's a tournament
Loneliness turned off and now it's on again
Tell myself run, ain't no lookin' back
Only time I do is when I'm reachin' for the stack
Back on my old ways, on my old Mac
Thinkin' 'bout my old days, I'll never go back
Fuck that, tryna get myself my own crib
Be an independent man, I might just suck my own dick
Ain't got time, baby just tryna gold dig
Gotta get through all the people that I roll with

[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just wanna know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah, hole in my soul, don't know how to fill it up
Cannot let nobody in, hopin' that they understand
Can't change my ways, since I get through my days
It's just how your boy was raised, vigilant in every way
Every single night I've been stayin' up
My imagination's takin' flight and it's takin' off
And my time is slowly tickin' now, I don't wanna wait anymore
Don't wanna be erased, wanna make a change

[Bridge: Joji & Rich Brian]
Please don't hurt me, I've just lost my way
(My way, my way, my way)
Leave no trace of my misery, get me through the day
Get me through the day (get me through the-)

[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just want to know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride



[Intro]
Menoh

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skrrt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki yeah she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
Imma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Now purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that wood now she goin for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
And she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more



[Intro: Lil Skies]
CashMoneyAP
Aye, aye, aye

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck
Want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin

CashMoneyAP
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu, villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah
I'm tryna cop a Benz, yeah, pull up and drop like ten, yeah
You tryna chase the life (what?) well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Verse 2]
Not a lot of love
Rollin' in the coupe and she was rollin' off the drugs
Lookin' for the one, girl, you know that I'm the plug
I be booted up with my shooters in the truck
Ayy, and broski keep it and it's tucked
Nigga talkin' 'bout it, but he never runnin' up
Put this shit in motion, so I'm never stayin' stuck
Don't be actin' starstruck every time they show you love

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love



[Intro]
Menoh
Blame on me, no shame on you
No shame on you, blame on me no
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Why you like to lie, shawty, you know you impressed
See you fuckin' with me now 'cause I bossed up and I flex
All they like to do is talk when they knew that I was next
I just come up with these hits and lay low, collect my checks
She fuck with solid niggas (aye)
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys
Watch my back, niggas lurkin', my girl look better in person
And she still picture perfect, dip and dash when we swervin'
Oh me, oh my (oh my)
Put my hand on your thighs (your thighs)
If I come through tonight (tonight)
I'll make you touch the sky (the sky)
Don't need to wink my eye (my eye)
No, I'm not even playin' (I'm not playin')
You know just what I'm sayin' (what I'm sayin')
Got you and all you cravings

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Hold my wrist up out the coupe, two bitches switch-a-roo
That pussy good, I'm blamin' you, you drippin', shame on you
She got real water (water), head real smarter (head)
Think that bitch from Florida, you probably can't afford her
Bentley truck might park the coupe, I'm livin' comfortable
Told money then I'm stuck with you, no I'm in love with you
Plug pull up in the UFO, no small talk, I'm the CEO
My bitches is bad, they do the most
She way too foreign, straight off the boat
I put her on top, she leakin', she leakin'
Turn to a freak on the weekend, the weekend
Blame on me, no shame on you, girl you can't hide the truth
I might get a 'Rari coupe, but just to flex on you

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Blame on me, no, shame on you (on you)
No, you can't hide the truth
I'ma slide right through your roof (your roof)
Might pop a pill or two
Let them hate, we chuck the deuce (the deuce)
Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice (some juice)
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh



[Intro]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

[Verse 1]
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
19 with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, "Broski you a star"
I said brother hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage
Now I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

[Verse 2]
I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation
I could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated
For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated
Five racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas
Gnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb
Young niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us

[Chorus]
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo



[Intro: Yung Pinch]

Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Big body, she gon' swerve it, now we went by the surface
Shorty lookin' picture perfect, say she ready, never nervous
I wanna know like its urgent, give her good pipe when in person
You want the cars and the purses, baby girl, tell me is it worth it
I'm in a spaceship, get ready for takeoff
Can't fuck with lil' shorty, I know that she basic
She makin' my dick soft, these niggas hatin'
Said I wouldn't make it, I shine with a new floss
I got his girl in a room gettin' naked, she fuck with a real boss
When my gang walk in it's lit (it's lit), legit (legit)
Give her the D then she dismiss (dismiss), no kiss (no kiss)
You test me then you getting hit (hit), lil' bitch (lil' bitch)
I take my shot and I don't miss (don't miss), my diamonds piss (piss)
And girl that's funny 'cause I know you
You just come around and make a name
Girl, I know you, gon' tell me that you different and you changed
But I know you- are everything you say you ain't
You tried to take me down, I left you in the rain

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 2: Yung Pinch]
Look, she want the money and the fame, told her you gotta go
I ain't gon' give your ass a thing, she want a pot of gold
Back when I was young I had a lot of hoes
I'm talkin' back before I got this dough, now I see how they rockin'
I know how you roll now, ain't no need for talkin'
That shit gettin' old now, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these goals down, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these hoes down (hold up, wait)
Gucci down to the socks (ho yeah), that's a beach boy, baby
Pull up to the party, shawty all up on me, now she wanna date me
Said she wanna have my baby
I ain't know that was your lady oh no
I've been workin' off the clock for this shit, did a lot for this shit
Please don't expect me just to give it up
Shorty wanna rock with the kid
I gave her cock then I dipped, told lil mama go ahead and live it up

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you



[Intro]
Girl, never lie to me
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Duck from the flashin' lights, watch out when the tide comin'
All these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really tell me somethin', ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

[Verse 1]
Rollin' cookie in L.A., I think I found my bae
She roll my weed, so she gonna be hard to replace
We takin' shots of that Henny, I don't need a chase
Almost forgot where I'm at, can barely feel my face
Rockstar lifestyle, might just die tonight
If I was down and had nobody, would you sacrifice?
They said loose ends break friends, I ain't tryna fight
Fuck bein' sober, girl, come over and enjoy the high
So don't fuck up the vibe, don't ever waste my time
And when I'm feelin' down, will you come stay the night?
And if you far away, then will you book a flight?
My neck flooded with ice, she grip it like a vice
Can't ever play it nice, the world so full of lies
And I'm not bein' them, 'cause I'm just not that guy
You wanna be somebody, so put aside your pride
So open up your eyes, they talkin' from outside

[Chorus]
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'
I take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

[Verse 2]
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'
I know they hatin' on me 'cause I really came from nothin'
I just wanna talk to you, can we have discussion?
Why you frontin' on me, shawty, better stop the bluffin'
You better stop the bluffin', I really know you want it
You push that thing up on me, so I'ma jump up on it
I ain't gonna fake it because I know I want it
These niggas so 50, I keep my shit a hundred
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie
And you know we up in the sky
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie
And you know we up in the sky



[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't think I love you, my emotions aren't the same
I'd rather be alone than go hangout with some lames
It's funny how they judge you when they see you made a change
I poured another four just to take away the pain
My friends weren't my friends, they was lookin' for some clout
I had what they wanted so they always came around
You told me you would be there but you never held it down
I'm out here bein' loyal, now I'm lookin' like a clown
I popped another Addy, now my heart is speedin' up
And I don't wanna love you, shorty, I just wanna fuck
Got angels on my shoulders, I got demons in my cup
I'm hardly ever out because it's hard for me to trust

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Bridge]
But I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos

[Verse 2]
Roll a blunt and relax, ease your mind (ease your mind)
I'ma be here for a while, take your time (take your time)
Lock the doors, spill your heart, never lie (never lie)
And they talk about me now 'cause I'm that guy (guy)
They say I needed help but I did this by myself (by myself)
Smokin' all the time, hardly thinkin' 'bout my health
I just been alone, I'm not thinkin' that it helps
They threw me in a fire and expected me to melt
I came out a warrior, I had to make it last
I'm not the type to worry 'bout a problem in the past
And I just keep on movin' knowin' that I made this path
These bitches say they love you but will switch up for some cash
I put myself in college, I was taught that that was right
Well, now I'm 18 and I see that's not my life
I'm under too much pressure, feel like I can't take advice
You only live once, fuck the rules, I'm takin' flight
My niggas in the cage, free 'em out, fuck the law
I swear when they get out, on my life, we gonna ball
You wanna be a great, be yourself, fuck them all
Explain myself too much, now I'm feelin' lockjaw

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Outro]
But I can't do no fake friends (fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake friends (fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake hoes (fake hoes)
No, I can't do no fake bros (fake bros)
I just need the pesos (pesos)



[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, yuh, yuh, yuh
(Menoh)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

[Bridge]
Ayy, Why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

[Verse 1]
Getting money, I'm gone on a chase
Fuck a ho, I be stacking my cake
I'm no hero, they gave me the cape
First place when I finish the race
In her room and she giving me face
When I nut, she gon' give me my space
You a lame so you cannot relate
Hittin' licks, had to hide from the jakes
Crack the code, then I open the safe
Get my money, then go out the way
Charged up, I feel like triple-A
Think she loyal, I'm fucking your bae
Let 'em talk, I don't care what they say
Niggas pussy, be riding my wave
Ain't my nigga, then get off the stage
Kick that boy in his shit, Johnny Cage
Pom-pom ass nigga
Ol' Uncle Tom ass niggas
Boy, I don't wanna take a picture
All these niggas talking all on Twitter
Talkin' 'bout pulling up with hitters
You a goofy, just look at your image
I'm in the game like a scrimmage
Stack it up, I can't let it diminish

[Chorus]
I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

[Bridge]
Ayy, Why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

[Verse 2]
Ayy, and now you're my enemy
You said you was down to ride
But you're not a friend of me
In the game like a referee
I'm just getting what's meant for me
And they love to hate all the time
But these niggas pressed on me
And they tryna copy the swag
But they cannot get it from me
In the kitchen with recipes
Money long like a centipede
I got up and got it on my own
Be faited with destiny
And I'ma go get all the money
And do this for my family



[Intro]
Yeah, woa-
Woah
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Roll up my Backwood and let me get high (get high)
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice (sacrifice)
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie (damn lie)
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie (damn tie)
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind?
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside (feel inside)
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right (feels right)
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

[Verse 1]
More ice
She wanna stay the night, tell lil shorty, "Catch a flight"
I was down and MIA fuckin' bitches, actin' trife
You wanna be my wife, ride it like you ride a bike
All this money in my hands, I'ma throw it on the ground
Like it when you back it up but better when you take it down
What don't break me only make me, smokin' OG out the pound
I got niggas that will shoot but if cops come don't make a sound
So, I sit back and watch, pray I see another day
Got Gucci with Supreme, shawty different in her way
Rock Chanel all the time, we go shoppin' in the Bay
East side in PA, they ain't loyal where I stay
So I'm out here layin' low, dodgin' vibes that I don't need
Everybody want somebody, don't confuse that with your needs
Send a message to my shorty, this ain't workin', gotta leave
I've been up, hardly sober, so let me

[Chorus]
Roll this Backwood and let me get high (get high)
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice (sacrifice)
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie (damn lie)
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie (damn tie)
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind? (on your mind?)
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside (feel inside)
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right (feels right)
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight (even tight)
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice (sacrifice)
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie (damn lie)
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie (damn tie)
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind? (on your mind?)
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside (feel inside)
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right (feels right)
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

[Verse 2]
No, no
You actin' like my bro, but you really gonna fold
I ain't tryna make no friends, I've been lonely down this road
I've been ridin' through the Hills, takin' views through the scope
Thumbin' through this cash, yeah, flexin' on my ex
And I can't get no rest, nah, I'm tryna be my best
I'm a monster in the flesh, think she want me 'cause I'm next
And I don't worry 'bout her moves 'cause she know I ain't pressed
Lately I've been stressed, press reset
I've been in the mix, let me pop a Percocet
Baby, let's get drunk and fuck like we first met
And I ain't got no plans when you slide and send a text

[Outro]
Yeah (yeah), ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
Roll up this Backwood, just let me get high (get high)
Yeah, I just need to get high
I don't care what they say, I gotta get high (get high)



[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (a tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (the purist)
I made a hundred thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (the weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
And it's like that, lil' bitch
MVP, I don't get no sleep, no, I don't like that, lil' bitch
Bust that open, I want that ocean, yeah that bite back, lil' bitch
Do it bite back, lil' bitch? Need two life jackets, lil' bitch
I ain't gon' hold you, I ain't gon' press you, never control you
I ain't gon' front you, keep it 100, I don't know you
Boss like Top Dawg, bossed my life up, crossin' over
Stutter steppin', got a Hall of Fame in all my posters
I've been ready, my whip been ready
My bitch been ready, my clique been ready
My shit's been ready, my check's been ready
My shot's on full, that's Armageddon
I got pull, I hope y'all ready
My tank on full, you know, unleaded
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
My name gon' hold up, my team gon' hold up
My name gon' hold up, my team gon' hold up
My shots gon' fire, my team gon' roll up
Ménage-à-trois, my queen gon' roll up
I hope y'all ready, you know I'm ready
I reign all day, you know, confetti
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, skrrt

[Chorus: Future & Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (bullshit)
You're not a gang member, you's a tourist (a tourist)
I be blackin' out, I be blackin' out
Bought an '83 Cutlass for the weekend (for the weekend)
I got a hundred thousand, then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I made 500 thousand, then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I put a Rolls Royce on my wrist, oh yee-ee
Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss
I took her to my penthouse, then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I haven't made my mind up, should I keep it? (Should I keep it?)
I got big dog status, it ain't no secret

[Bridge: Future & Jay Rock]
La di da di da, slob on me knob
Pass me some syrup, fuck me in the car
La di da di da, mothafuck the law
Chitty chitty bang, murder everything
Bitch, I'm on a roll, and I put that on the gang

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, miss me with that bullshit (bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (a tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (the purist)
I made a hundred thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (the weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)

[Interlude: James Blake & Kendrick Lamar]
Changes
Is you gon' do somethin'?
(What you want?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC 10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit...

[Pre-Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Turn me up
Sin City, Sin City
Sin City, Sin City

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches
Tell the truth, nigga, I'm lost without it
7 figures for a headline
You want some stage time? We can talk about it
Niggas actin' like they be rappin'
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live
That decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes
They ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade
But now she got some ass, I wan' hit it now
I don't lease, I just all out feast
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs
That's a new raise and a signing bonus

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy—can't stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30
105, I'm stomping fast
With these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might ban myself
I just might... God!

[Bridge: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I'm focused feeling blessed
'Cause my eyes be the truth
I'm focused feeling blessed
'Cause my eyes be the truth

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Mental window blurry as a bitch
Still lookin' out it
So much money off the fuckin' books
Could write a book about it
Took a minute, no, wait a minute
Let me think about it
Bout ten years, Crips, Bloods
Sweat and tears, and we still counting
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn
She fucked the whole squad
Now every time I land in Brooklyn
They fuck with the whole squad
I'm more spiritual than lyrical
I'm similar to Eli, why?
'Cause I'm wearin' black shades
And I'm headed west with the word of God (Amen)
Yah
I think I'm finally ready to talk about it
These niggas just talk about it
Homie don't play me for no fool
Poppin' bottles like enemigos
[Os] dios mio, I'm so cold
Get so deep in that water, water
They should call my johnson a harpoon

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Feed the needy, don't know graffiti
Paint her walls like a cartoon
Beat the pussy up so bad
Send her home with some war wounds
Loaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back
Goin' 'cross her head, bar stool
Touch her soul, 'til I curl her toes
Then it's time to reload, then it's part two

[Verse 5: ScHoolboy Q]
Damn near 30, still set trippin' cuz
Where you're from, I'ma see about it
Last year I made ten million
That's where I've been, yeah, a private island
Smoking something, on autopilot
Got too many cars, I might crash a whip
New 'Rari pedal barely tapping
Nigga, vroom-vroom, yeah, I'm rich, bitch
Got two rollies, but one missing
Think my daughter flossing, she in kindergarten
Got one crib worth two cribs
And my front lawn, yeah, that's water fountain
You be talking boss, saying big words
Like philosophies, man, you weird homie
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck
And your bitch gon' leave, and that's real, homie

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
That shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might damn myself
I just might... GOD!... GOD!

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumpin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me "Keep it pushin'!"
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it

I got the whole block bumpin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
(Huh?) And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, [pow pow] drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumpin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
The home girls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esse's at arm reach; one West

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumpin'
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public



[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road
No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it
You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo
I keep it cool to keep from goin' coo-coo
With a cal', aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way
I won't let up, I won't shut up
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written
In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
Been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent, then — cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew
And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
See? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
See? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight
I got to eat 'til it shows on my face
Tragedy turned to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate
Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith
Playin' at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupils'll dilate
Their speakers'll vibrate
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum
I come from the slums, we come for the funds
Like run it, under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
Countin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds
Keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, Look, I'm runnin' through it
Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy
This my gutter fluid, nothin' to it
What we lost, we gon' make it back
Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it



[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Sometimes a nigga feel like
Everybody ain't real like
Johnny McKinzie
If I could pretend, see I wouldn't feel right
I bought a Dodge Magnum
I just got signed, everybody on my line
They wanna know the taxes
Do Rock got a mansion? 30K to my moms
The hood turnt up
Bitches, bottles, dope and all that stuff
For attention, high hopes and call my bluff
Offended by the notes when I lost love
Things change, people change, niggas change
Bitches change, friend or foe, if or so, pick a lane
Lil' Wayne on my single now
Fuckin' hoes like I'm single now
Triggers close to my fingers now
But when the label frozed up, they all chosed up
They tellin' me you a non-believer now
A felony all I could think about
The cars got repoed
The bills they add up
My bitch done left me
I smoked my last one
I'm high with no sleep
I pray a bag come
I just might grab one
I just might blast one of you
Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
But I got these wins to gain
And I don't feel comfortable
One thing that I've learnt all of these years
Is to block devils off of my ears
Cause fairy tales don't end well
When the fame and fortune not here
Everybody

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Promethazine in a baby bottle
Meditatin' on daily dollars
Lately problems
Stem from my bitch cause she know I still fuck with my baby mama
So there be drama
In the house, I gotta find a outlet
Waitin' on a plug just like a fuckin' outlet
Fuck it, I'm turnin' my phone off
Fantasies of grabbin' the heat and burnin' my nose off, blaow!
Niggas might not know but I'm slightly throwed off
And I might need Zoloft
But for now, these Xannies'll do
Hear the sound, a manic depressive
That ain't been prescripted, what can he do?
Anywho
Boy, when you got it, you keep a close watch
On the ones that's befriendin' you (friendin' you)
Them'll be the ones that's envy you (envy you)
Vividly dreamin' 'bout endin' you (endin' you)
But when you low, they don't tend to you (tend to you)
Actin' new when they run into you (into you)
Fuckin' your bitch tryna feel like you (feel like you)
This the message I send to you

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (look both ways)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (hmmm)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (hmmm)
Look both ways cause if you cross me, I kill ya

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time (out of sight)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Rippin' and runnin' wild
My momma say, "Slow it down", I don't listen to her
All of my felonies on file
Sippin' liquor 'til my liver ruined
My partner just lost trial
This system'll give it to you when you gettin' to it
How could you calm down?
Cause soon as your guard's down, it's a pistol to it
G-ride special, it's a Buick
I'm guilty but I said I didn't do it
Pressure bust pipes like a gunfight
I ain't never bring a knife to it
I done been through it and I been through it
All the rah-rah, I'm in a high rise
Instead of music and the interviewin'
I could be a nigga dead in a viewin'
Would you take a look inside of my eyes?
I'm surrounded by a bunch of blind guys
Out of sight and out of my mind
But y'all can never see me, checkin' chicken fettuccine
And I wish a nigga would
When I'm in this Lamborghini
Top back in the bity
Top down on a Bentley
Top Dawg's on the map
We familiar with your ways, we don't even need the app
Sorry but I gotta ask
You runnin' the trap or just runnin' your trap?
I'm runnin' amok, I'm runnin' it up
Runnin' across the finish line
Hope you worth more than yo' Rolex when you run up out of time

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Intro: Jay Rock]
This shit is fresh out the oven
Fresh out the oven

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm back in this bitch, nigga you know what's up
Stackin' my dividends
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin' with
Highly belligerent
But that's way before the liquor hits
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now
Lookin', lookin', she tryna sabatoge my thing
Never go brazy when you're deep inside the pink
I'm lowkey like a drug dealer
So don't snitch, my nigga, get your chips, my nigga
Mind your business, I minds mine, let's get rich, my nigga
Take our family on trips, my nigga
But if you try me then your wig I'ma split, my nigga
And I ain't tryna kill my own kind
But we always losin' to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie
And they wonder why us niggas always get high
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly
Another thou-wow on it just to get by
Fuck it, only got one life to live
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like

[Hook: Jay Rock]
What? This shit is fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin'
Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
I pull up and park, hop out and swag
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch
There's repercussions, and concussions
You know what's after that, end of discussions
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'
Could it be some intervention on some inner vision?
I don't know, 'cause I'm just goin' with the flow
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar + Jay Rock]
Ah, I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosies
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
And I don't do trends
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
We'll give 'em blues then
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby "Blue" Bland
Aye you a fool man
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
Baby come and get your blessin'
And she gon' fuck with this erection

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
I got somethin' good for all these hoes
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes
Now if I paid for your dress and your perm
That means you an investment, bitch
I'ma need my dough in return

[Part II]

[Radio Interlude]
We reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch

[Intro: SZA]
Itchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface
I ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none
You can find me where
The sun don't never end and the waves don't part
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I don't wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower
Dirty for you

[Verse: Jay Rock]
Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there
We 4 deep at a swapmeet, don't need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too crazy
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott free



[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Uh, imagine Rock up in that field where options ain't so audible
Problems steady fallin', the effects is like some dominoes
Issues chronological, gotta get that money fast
Andale, vamonos, feelin' like Osama, got my llama close
Hope them boys don't come knock at my mama's door
AK-47 out that window, think I'm paranoid
America, another case I can't afford, help me Lord

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Been about that money, fuck the damn lotto
Cruisin' through the 'jects wit' the 12 shotta
Most my niggas gone or the jail got em'
And most these bitches wrong but we still jock em'
Cocaine in the trap, still rockin'
Them hood rats in the back got that trim poppin'
She twerkin' for the camera while her kids watchin'
And she gon' take that cheese to go wig shoppin'
That's if she owe me that, go check my zodiac
Have many coke and cognac in that cul-de-sac
My uncle Bobby had them bodies, he wore the mac
Ain't talking oldies when its singin' that 40 clap
Can't nobody hold me back, I'mma locomotive steam rollin'
Gotta fight to keep that money stream open
Liquor shots is for your team, that's tree smokin'
In that coupe de ville with D's on it

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Gotta get it ain't no options out here
Her nigga just killed my partner out here
They wonder why we steady glockin' out here
Cuz niggas they ain't really lockin' out here
And we ain't worried 'bout them coppers out here
Do anything to try to stop us out here
No 9-to-5's but we clockin' out here
Every chance they get you know they watch us out here
Oh yeah, got to be that animal
Streets is like a jungle, it'll eat you like it's Hannibal
Wigs splitted, cantaloupe, yeah we see that everyday
Candles lit, pour out liquor, hope it take the pain away
I ain't tryna pay my way, I'm just tryna pave my way
Mama tell me gotta save them pennies for them rainy days
Have me snatch that switch, off that branch with some leaves on it
Fantasizin' bout some money trees on em'

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Outro: Jay Rock]
Yeah, on this journey we call life, its always gonna be obstacles, road blocks, things tryna hold you back. Just keep pushin, don't let that stop you. Never give up, stay chasin' money trees. Don't let nobody tell you you can't do it. Keep going, nahmean?
Don't let nobody stop you, I mean nobody. Uh huh, go hard for what you believe in
Stay up, wake up, cake up, get paper, and I swear to God things will fall in your favor

[Verse 1]
Keep it one hundred, I’m one hundred and one
I ain’t talking dalmatians up under the sun
On the road to Damascus, gun and a suit
You either coming with some products or you coming for loot
I’m coming with the peace so I’m chucking the deuce
I ain’t tryna run a train I’m just in the caboose
And I’m tryna give these niggas the truth
I ain’t ‘bout to spazz on ‘em, give ‘em light
I’m just doing my Zeus
Rubbing on her body just like a masseuse
And it’s money like a hobby for you to seduce
But if you blink twice nigga you can Medus'
See the snakes in here, look there's hate in there
I pray that you niggas all playing fair
You can’t help but stare as you face the glare, yeah
I’m not up on in short yellow
With a helmet on my head while I’m eating marshmallows
Playing jigsaw while I’m picking off devils
I can rock this shit on all levels
Straight up out the ES, journey over BS
I’m like a hundred kilos stuffed in the Prius
I’m going hard ‘til they free us

[Hook]
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you

[Verse 2]
Have you ever put your hand over fire
Just to see what you could tolerate?
And you can find no escape
Life is a Dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate
To make you mind your mistakes
Keeping my chin down, nose clean, with my guards up
Charged up ‘cause this ghetto got me scarred up
Yes, I’m the child with the crookedest smile
Look at my foul, look at what the star bucks
You can’t swim if you don’t paddle
Wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel
Bloodhound, for that federal reserve note
That’s when I noticed the switch, niggas is turncoats
It's the way of the world, carry the weight of the world
Carry a blade too, for they forsake you
Yeah, I’m the vision, from the night I was born
To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm
Eye on the clock, ain’t no need for alarms
Just get on your A-game when it’s time to perform
Yeah, and I can show you what it feels like
The moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight
So what it feel like?

[Hook]
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you

[Skit]
- "Hold up, wait a minute / Let me put some season in this gumbo"
- Nigga, shut the fuck up! Hey, hey! I'm tryna play you this new Rock, and you still singin' that shit. No nigga, new Rock! My nigga...
- But it ain't this gumbo from Mrs. Johnson

Fuck your plan, I'ma burn that castle!
Fuck that clan, I'ma burn that task force

Hoppin' out that van with the black ski mask

And it just might hurt you when I go
And my name might curse you when I go, bitch

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]

You done fucked up like you take a step back
Cool cat like a stray in a freezer in the back
Like you're Jay-Z no Roc-A-Fella holla back
But I'm 'bout the damn money boomerang back
Okay like lisp, is how I speak 'cause I sip
Lean like what's done on your bitch
In your mouth I fit a fist
Pistol best friends with my hip

Hot, but I swag, still nigga got the Ray Rays
Get away, get away, get away, get away

Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I know some young niggas from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar
I coulda went to school to be a doctor
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop
Still on a paper chase that don't ever stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot
Sremmlife!

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave

[Verse 1: Slim Jimmi]
I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat, pimpin', got a masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

[Chorus: Swae Lee & (Jace)]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing

I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying

But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
No keys to crank this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before that girl touch anything
She gotta say please (say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air, girl
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wasted so much time, should be a fuckin' crime

[Chorus: Swae Lee & (Jace)]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing

Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, baby
Spin the bottle
Truth or dare, nah, you don't want no problem
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, spin the fuckin' bottle
Truth or dare, no, no, you don't want no problem
You don't want no problem, bitch, you must want problems

[Chorus: Swae Lee & (Jace)]

[Intro]
Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chopped and screwed up
I'm a pothead, true enough
At your ex's crib and you're boo'd up
Take it slow baby, we in no rush
Hennessy or Don Q, that's a very hard choice
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah
Believe me, I'm out here, you see me, in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' round blunts like a hot potato
And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano

[Hook]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
You got girls in here? I'm recruitin'
And they fine, hop the line
I've been sippin' on Patrón and wine
I'm just tryna have a good fuckin' time
I was chillin' with the open container
Grabbed her arm, told her not to be a stranger
I was blowin' on the dank with my niggas
I was lookin' for the girls who willin'
Baby girl, if you fuck with me then we gettin' bands
If you smokin' with me then we on dabs
I don't fuck with local hoes, I told you that
How you movin', you deserve a couple racks

[Hook]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hundreds on your face, baby girl
Come and do that little thing that you was doin'
Aye they was in this mothafucka trippin'
What the hell they think we was doin'?
It seems like we're fuckin' in this club
Baby girl, what they think that we're doin'?
You gettin' on my nerves with them questions
Girl you know I'm tryna start a little movement
I ain't got no business fuckin' with you
Out the blue, you actin' brand new
Washingtons mean nothing to you
Same way with us

[Hook]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

Up... word!
Huh, up, up
Sonny Digital
Up, now you done fucked up
Ear Drummers

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Read my lips, I do my own stunts
Bitch wanna go on a date, pull up to SunTrust
Wear my hat to the front, like I drive a truck
Like I drive a truck, all white Bentley truck
ATM go nuts, I do what I want
I say what I want, I grew up on Pac
Kush smell just like musk, turn it into dust
Man, my style is tough, y'all huffed all that puff
Twerk like she from Russia, try hard not to love her
But she so damn bad, I might have to cuff her
Rock like Billy Ray, that's a nigga idol
Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes, read it like the Bible

[Chorus Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Up like Trump, all of the sudden
Solo cup when brought to the public
Balmain's clean as a whistle, green ain't the issue
Lil bit of money make a difference, nothin' is somethin'
It's so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck y'all assumption, my blood still rushin', my heart still thumpin'
Up like Trump, geekin' like "I.T."
Got a bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night, Sremm after dark, king of the swipe
Motherfuckers worry 'bout likes on they pictures
They ain't got an "Iguadala," or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny, for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles, like winners
Check my pedigree I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings, I'm shinin', like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, up like Donald Trump!

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

Stack my bread up, fuck ya head up, that's just what I'll do
Chillin' on my avenue, if you ain't remember, I remember, girl

You came over half and sober callin' me your boo
Then you turned around and fucked the crew
I got no love for you

[Chorus 2]
I can't have no wife, one night

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, riding 'round on boulders
Money sitting up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eating pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds, but that bitch was mighty fine
I got gold all on my necklace, tatted up my arms
Now my mama think I'm reckless, got guns under my mattress
I was jugging since a youngin, free my older cousin Reesey
He from Hamilton, not D.C, I rock NBs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you scared of them four walls?
I was stroking on your sister, she was calling me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty, nice to meet you
I was jugging off them stacks, counting up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them charges
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Migos!)
You need to stay up out the streets if you can't take the heat
When they said Lil Yachty hot, I'm like, "That's him or me?" (Lil Yachty)
Wrist like Minnesota, trapping Coca-Cola
Catching plays, Anquan Boldin
Jug out the hot box, know that it's stolen
Large sizes, all type of narcotics
Woah, got a bankroll in that big body
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
Fuck 12, they can't pull me over
Smoking on gas and that odor
Cook it up then flip it over
You must've forgot it, we 'bout it like soldiers
It's cold but I got my shirt off
Trap niggas can't fall off
Big sack of molly, golf ball
Big sack of molly, golf ball

[Verse 3: Skippa Da Fippa]
I trap in Minnesota like a viking
Flood out the Sky-Dweller, it got good lighting
We made the dab and all of y'all biting
Two thick white bitches, both of 'em dykes
I make a 50 before his acre
I was in the streets but I ain't have no cable
Me and Lil Yachty touch down at the safe house
Skippa Da Flippa, I will bring the rice out

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Cold like Minnesota, racks on fall, I told you
I iced out my Rollie, then did the same damn thing for my brodies
All a nigga trap spot beating like a pulse
I could put the heat inside the kitchen like a baller
I could fill your bitch head up like a lawyer
Ain't know, never 'gon sign posts
Big machine, big machine
I'm cooking bean on jelly beans
No need to smell it all, is clean
That money talking, Charlie Sheen
I'm riding Ubers with the toolie
I got more diamonds than your jeweler
I make her come back like I'm Yugi
If you ain't know it, now you knew it
I aim at her head like a sniper rifle
She can't be my bitch if she dyking, dyking
I bought her a ring but no wifey, wifey
She slurp on that dick and I like it, like it
No candy, she Mike and Ike it
No Nike, she know I do it
I eat that bitch like a hockey pocket
No Nike, she know I do it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Intro: Darnell Boat]
Oh, okay. Where? Oh, you want me to sit right here? Look right there? Okay, alright. I got it
Well, hello folks, Darnell Boat here. Today, I'ma tell you a little story about my two nephews: Lil Yachty and Lil Boat. Well, I don't know where to start. Look, here's Lil Boat now...

[Verse 1: Lil Boat]
Lil Boat!
I got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll
How you do it? Only God know
I want to know who's real until the time fold
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'mma stay down with the same niggas I came up with that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12

[Interlude: Darnell Boat & Lil Yachty]
See, he's a little- he's a little bit more aggressive. Well, you know, as this story unfolds, and--you know what I'm saying--as the story gets told, I'll tell you a little bit more about Yachty. He's a little bit nicer. Let's call him
Hello? Hello?.

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Oh, oh, ohhh
Hello Boat, it's so nice to meet you
I'm so glad you came
Hello, hello
What's poppin'? It's Lil Yachty, I'm in the party
I need three thotties to come suck on my posse
What's poppin'? Woah
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Oh, hello
Welcome to my life
Hello, hello, hello

[Intro]
Young Ugly God, bruh
The title explains everything, nigga
I don't got to say shit

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Interlude]
And don't even act like this message is just for the boys
Girls y'all be looking at ass, too. I be seeing y'all
But you know when you see a big thick booty bitch in the mall
You can't do shit but just look at that booty from a distance

[Verse 1]
Booty from afar, same difference
Young Ugly God spot your booty from a distance
20/20 vision, nigga, I know I ain't trippin'
I just saw a booty from a whole 'nother district
I'm walking in my Sketchers ready for whatever
Booty from a distance, bitch I'm finna bring the pressure
Never disrespect the booty treat it like a treasure
Never disrespect the booty listen to your elders
40 booties from a distance, damn I must be dreamin
I sense another booty from a whole different region
Booty from a distance got me feeling like a demon
Never cuff a bitch, my hoes change like the seasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 2]
Young Ugly God explore the booty like a forest
My teeny weeny dick came hard like my chorus
Little Dick Clique and I don't wanna be enormous
I open up the booty like a god damn thesaurus
My name is Ugly God but all my hoes is gorgeous
Hoes on my dick cause I just got a abortion
Ugly God get three hoes and have a foursome
I'm ugly but my self esteem higher than your mortgage
Booty from a distance I see booty out in orbit
I could fuck your bitch but your momma more important
Made your bitch come out her shell like a tortoise
Young Ugly God make these other rappers forfeit

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Aye Bibby, let's kill shit broski

It's whatever man, just go on ahead and rip that shit
I'mma come around and clean that shit up
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
150, I'm really wit' it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
Lil Bibby on the track with me
One mistake and he clap fifty
When I hit the scene hoes go insane
Cause they know a nigga got them racks wit' me
No velcro but the strap wit' me
Let a nigga wanna act silly
I'mma let it off and then leave him there
Ride off and don't even care
Bitch I cash out 'till I pass out
Got a couple trues I don't even wear
In the game bitch I do my thang
Hoes scream my name I ain't even there
Lil Herb boy I do's this
Leave your bitch wetter than a pool pit
And I make bands like I make friends
Bought some Ray-Bans on some cool shit
But now it's back to some killa shit
Got some wild hoes that'll drill a bitch
Yea it's no limit, thirty years runnin'
Thirty years gunnin' and we still the shit
I never run cause I stay to fight
I'll cook a nigga like steak and rice
And it's hella real in the battlefield
Gangbang gotta pay the price
Hit a nigga with the forty fifth
Bet it make his ass do forty flips
M-O-B I don't love a ho
I'mma be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die
Smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man
Cause I understand how a nigga lie
Never snitch on a nigga dry
Yeah that's how a nigga die
Got a yellow bitch in the passenger
She gon' suck and fuck if I get her high
If I do the dash then my whip will fly
Foreign shit what a nigga ride
I ain't never snoozin', let a nigga try
Got the nine ruger on a nigga side

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Lil Bibby, no limit
Yea I'm all about that sack bitch
My young niggas they clap shit
Let the MAC spit, we whack shit
Weezy in that cut
With that nina that's that black bitch
Rico wanna' get 'em I'm like, "Cuz man, I got this"
Shootin' shit, hittin' shit, four five extended clip
Y'all be on that snitchin' shit and y'all know what snitches get
No limit shit, we wit' the shits, I'm focused on gettin' rich
M-O-B forget a bitch, right after I hit the bitch
Like point me to the kitchen bitch, I be water whippin' shit
Whip it, Jeff Gordon whip it, hit it wit' the fork
Straight drop no shorts, shooters on and off the court
Shoot a nigga off his porch, turn a nigga to a corpse
Yeah, I'm bout that, rollin' up that loud pack
Catch me lackin'? I doubt that
Cause I never leave without that
And that's real shit, got real hitters, they kill shit
You fuck around hit the kill switch
These hollow tips you feel this
And I'm tryna get real rich
Cause my mama said I wouldn't be shit
Nobody never gave me shit
Like "Bibby hop on this remix"
That's five hundred, no free shit
Cause I'm hot and I do this shit for my block
I got thirty off in that Glock, have my nina give you top
Bodies gon' drop and we ain't gon' stop, R.I.P Roc
Catch a few ops, send a few shots
Might hit a few blocks, fuck a few thots
I need two mill might seem like a lot
But I spit straight drop so its really not
My team gon' eat, R.I.P to police
Fake niggas don't speak, cop killers in the heat
Catch me in the streets, shout out to broski

Hit the club deep and we off them yoppas
All my niggas fly, we came for the bitches
But don't get it twisted, we still for the drama
Pop a lot of bottles, all my niggas with me
The ones you don't see? Outside with them choppas
Back to what I said, we here for the hoes
All them bitches love me now
I'm gettin' money, I might pull up in a Rov
Came from nothin', I just had to let them know
So don't mix me up in this rap shit
I don't rap beef, get you wrapped quick
I be in the streets, every nigga know me
If you lookin' for me, you can get to me
150 with me, my shooters with me
All they know is kill, show no sympathy
And they kill for free, don't get killed for me
Lil bro got it on him off a pill or three
We don't show ID, couple shorties with me
Tottin' thirty clips only sixteen
Fly my bros out, buy some new poles
Spend a few cheese, that's a sixteen

[Pre-Hook]
And who this nigga approachin'? Don't know him
If he do somethin' put infrared on him
He make a move and you know we start blowin'
They rollin', they rollin', they rollin', they rollin'

Nina nice and little but she still'll fuck you

That little clip, that shit got a million views
I ain't never got no views on some shit out

[Verse 1]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
In the S or the Porsche Carrera or some
Fuck twins like Tia and Tamera somethin'
Yeah, that boy gettin' bread, Panera, somethin'
Landed in the GT, leer or somethin'
Put Posto in the air or somethin'
Marry her, she havin' affairs
I'ma spin that ho like Pharris
Born in the Chi like Ye
But I do crimes like Bump J, I ain't scared of nothin'
Passport stamp, young nigga ran up that sack
Might as well go to Paris, huh?
Woofin, got whacked you embarrassed, huh?
Pussy you act like you scared of somethin'
Gon' and shoot up the terrorists (shoot up the terrorists)
Then they gon' realize it's serious (blah, blah)
I ain't even on that, period (period)
I'm makin' millions, I'm serious (I'm makin' millions)
That money come in various (furious)
Can't count it, I get delirious (delirious)
I bought my mama a mansion (a mansion)
So I can't trip over materials (yeah, yeah)
But I'm still dipped in that fashion
Know I stay drippin', that's period
These niggas drippin', that's period
Nah, they can't find me and I'm serious (serious)
They right behind, I'm serious (serious)
And I'm straight off the 9, now I'm serious
Who you gon' send to fuck with me?
Take stuff from me or from any of mine? Now I'm curious (I'm curious)
Better think 'fore you bust at me
If you miss, I'll clap a 50 and, man, now I'm furious
Dived in that water, dived like Aquarius
Young nigga, we was breakin' the barriers (breakin' the barriers)
If you grabbin' that torch, better carry it (better carry it)
Tryna hide on that porch on some scary shit (fuck yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, "Gang-gang first," you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
"Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried"
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on, everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, I wasn't there, your Honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to balley, get a brib, I'm ballin'
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, "Fuck it, no problem, it'll do"
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)

What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Outro]

Aye and that shit so wet I took the rubber off, can't even use it
I love when you start screamin' out when I go deep into it

We go again, over and over, know she my opponent
Win, lose, or draw

I kiss your lips, we lick and suck, and let me bend it over
She throw it back, I'm in her stomach, know she feelin' it
So deep, she tryna run but can't because I'm still in it
She feelin' it, she lovin' it, she feelin' it
We wasn't deep at first but now we got our feelin's in

When I land', I'm on my way, can't wait to put my mouth on it

[Interlude]

You already know what is man when you callin' me baby

Tongue kiss your lips, caress you, stroke you for an hour
She leakin', soakin', bite her lips soon as I'm slidin' in
Can't get no deeper, she start scratchin', and she grabbin' me
I can take the pain, she say my name when I start grinding it
Fucked around and fell in love, I met her from around the land
First started off as my little bitch, wasn't even fuckin' then
Let me inside, I'll beat it up, and I've been busting since
Can't take it when I'm lickin' it, when I start suckin' it
She comin' in spread her legs, keep lickin', make her cum again
She know I keep it super real, realer than most of 'em
She know it's fuck them other bitches, can't get over her
Aye, like a roller coast with her
Haa, she ride, I'm holdin' her
And after that I told her

[Outro]
(Let me lick you soakin' wet baby)
Let me lick you soakin' wet baby, haha

My feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground
And it feels like I can see the sins on the horizon
Every time you are not around I slowly drift away

[Hook]
Tryna stay afloat
Gotta tell the rap industry cause they don't know
Keep protection on me everywhere I go
But that's the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
This the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
So you wanna be a dope boy, yeah I know
You ain't fuckin' with no broke boys, yeah I know
So you wanna put the grind in, yeah I know
Catch a case do your time, yeah I know
Pussy niggas gon' hate, yeah I know
And real street niggas gon' always relate, yeah I know
I'ma be great, yeah I know

[Verse]
Yeah I know, yeah I know
Used to post on the 8-block, I was dead broke and they missed that, yeah I know
Niggas stunted on me, tryna flex on me, now it's mix-match, yeah I know
Niggas down talked me, I'm a bitch nigga this, I'ma get whacked, yeah I know
Keep somethin' on me for the get back, click-clack, shit's splat, yeah I know
Young nigga got AK's, 10 Glocks, little Jocks, big Macks, GI Joe
They ain't believe, thought I wasn't gon' be shit, be rich, yeah I know
Never gave me shit, got it all on my own, nigga G shit, yeah I know
I smoke me 2-3 to the dome soon as I'm alone
Just thinkin' bout my life I'm happy that I made it home
Cause Lord knows I've been doin' wrong out there all day long
But Lord knows that I'm just tryna put all of my people on
Lord knows I got some issues, miss all of my people gone
Long live King Cap I miss you wish you could just hit my phone
How you used to pull up on me, pour it up, let's get it on
When the oz's smokin' blunts of OG, we just flip and gone
Gotta watch for cops, tryna duck them high speeds, know we got the chrome
Why you couldn't just have your chrome on that day? Man I miss you dawg
Know we down here rockin' out, no talkin', you know you my dawg
Yeah you was my nigga and they ain't know you like I knew you dawg
Matter of fact most of these niggas really ain't know you at all
Niggas out here talkin' runnin' they mouth like you wouldn't shoot it off
Niggas out here ridin' on they high horse like you ain't shoot it all
Like you wasn't out ridin' round with that torch tryna get
No Limit that score
Like you wasn't out five pipes
In that Porsche through the opps, niggas just bored
Might as well lay it out there on the table now since you ain't here no more
I lost my bro right before my tape was out
Young nigga goin' crazy now
Stackin' books got the shit comin' in by the pages now
Got me feelin' like I made it now
Made a way out some shit then fucked around and made a habit
Stayed focus then I made it happen
Even through Chiraq I be ridin' round crazy
Ratchets, got me wishin' that I stayed in Cali
Ever since that day and even before, hit a bitch everywhere I go
But ever since that day I think of you tellin' me I need that
Yeah I know, yeah I know

[Hook]
Tryna stay afloat
Gotta tell the rap industry cuz they don't know
Keep protection on me everywhere I go
But that's the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know

Nigga talkin' down bout Buckz probably
Cause I don't fuck with that nigga
I say I did this shit for my dogs
Just make a call, they'll risk it all
Or if it's that I just send 'em a text
Have my youngin's come through make it rain on your set
Sleeping on couches, had pains in my neck
Now I got three or four chains on my neck
Bitches be trippin', I can't fuck with that
Cut that bitch off cause I ain't for the stress
These niggas be set trippin'
Switchin' sides, set flippin'
Pocket watch, sneak dissin'
Why you worried about the next nigga?
Why you all in my pockets?
Why I'm always a topic?
Nigga get up off of your ass
Go and make you a profit
Buy the mall when I be goin' shoppin'
Got a habit, really need to stop it
We be tottin', Lil Squeak got it
These niggas know that he'll pop it
Niggas know I spit that ether
Bitch I ain't doin' no features
Bout to cash out on that Porsche just to ride past my teacher

We was in the trap and we was in the stu'
And we was out there tottin' guns
Took hard work to run them bands up so we fuck it all for fun
And G-Fazo would be proud of me so I fuck it all for 1's
And we got choppers with the drums
All type of fuckin' guns
Know the Feds watchin'
Niggas prolly workin', I ain't talkin', I'mma run
When they find me, I be high
Chiefin', chokin', coughin' up my lungs
Robins full of Hunds
I don't check for hoes in the club
I buy crushes, fantas, dutches, swishers with my ones
80 dollar cups
But I'm through with that shit, tryna give it up
Yeah I fell in love
'Member saying I could never get enough
Bitches on me, they can't ever get enough
Call 'em up, any day I'm gettin' fucked
5AM, in the hill just me and Bucks
Who the hottest from the 'Go? Just me and Bucks
Take it how you wanna, I don't give a fuck
Nigga run up on me, all you hear is buck
Now somebody pick him up
Treat me notepad like it's Spalding ball every time I pick it up
Record labels calling now
Nigga balling like I'm tryna pick 'em up, nigga (huh)

[Outro]
Ugh, hey, hey, hey Bibby what's up bro, you already know how we rockin' it man. 150 dream team the campaign man. Free all the 150 demons, RIP all our niggas man. Look. -
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry)



[Intro]
Gang
Got a lot of shit on my mind I've been tryna' get off me man
This for the streets, know what I'm saying?
This ain't no 4 Minutes Of Hell, Pt. 4, none of that
This just bars right here
No Limit MB, 150 Rock Block shit man
Ball Like I'm Kobe, the mixtape
Self-made, no nigga never gave me shit man
Self-Paid, on my own, me and my niggas
My squad, you know?

[Verse]
Bitch I’m still the hottest, I’m just being honest
Turn me up a notch, I’m on supersonic
I ain’t been asleep, bitch it's 8 o clock
When you finish noddin’ me meet me at the top
G Herbo in your city, fillin up the spot
Leanin' off the drop, Mally got the Glock
Everywhere I go, Robin, Truey'd be up
Louis, Gucci’d up, all the newest stuff
While my diamond dancing and my robins glancin'
Pocket full of Jacksons, shoebox full of Franklins
Smoking on Jamaican, all my clothes be stinkin’
I know niggas hatin', choppas like the Haitians
I ain’t single-chasin’, I’m just bein’ patient
Everything I’m saying, history in the making
Listen what I’m saying, I get in my zone
Offer me a milli I won’t even take it
Where I’m from man, mill look like a nigga made it
When I milk the game it's gon' change up
Feelin’ like a nigga made it
Run it back, there ya nigga made it, huh
And I be ridin’ down Lake Shore, gettin’ faded
Dutchies, double cups, gettin’ wasted, thinking
I know ain’t no nigga fuckin’ with me
Hottest, youngest in the fucking city
All the bitches wanna fuckin’ lick me
Cause I just left the Summer Jam with Nicki
And she just helped me book a couple shows
I might hit the road and go chuck a fifty
Hundred niggas and we got them poles
And they gon' unload, you better not come near me
I be in the streets, catch me over East
When I see police, I don’t talk to any
When you basic all the bitches complicatin'
When you getting money they start complimentin'
When it come to bitches I done ran through several
You get on my level, nigga now you pimpin’
I be doggin' hoes, never callin' hoes
Pillow talkin’ hoes, nigga now you trippin’
Coppin’ and I’m flippin, smoking and I'm sipping
Fucking and I’m pimping, package and I'm sending
Rapping and I’m trapping, earning and I’m spending
Make a broke nigga learn to pay attention
If I do not fuck with you it’s my decision
Die a real nigga, true to my religion
You might go out snitchin', I'mma go No Limit
Everywhere he go you know his .44 wit him
All that I remember is a .44 hit him
I was off the lean, bro was off a bean
When we in the scene 30's with the beams
Leave a murder scene, we ain’t heard a thing
Niggas hatin', act like they ain’t heard of me
Call my phone for verses like emergencies
Swagger-jacking, they committing burglaries
I’m a trend setter, I'll set it off
Desert Eagle same one as Queen Latifah
It's a bitch, press her, I'll let it off
These lil niggas, man they can’t compare to me
They ain’t gon’ step to me cause I’m gon’ get it on
Every day I leave the crib and sacrifice
I might go to prison, I might die tonight
'Till that day I’m livin’, nah, I ain’t scared
Lotta niggas bitches, don’t know how to fight
Leave ‘em wit' a right, bro go get the pipe
Look out for the cops, don’t see none in sight
All my niggas hustle, barely gettin’ by
Stressin', smokin’ ounces barely gettin’ high
Out here seen a lotta real niggas die
Prolly reason why a nigga get so high
Get so high feel like I live in the sky
I'm so high I could tell all my niggas hi
Wish I had a chance to tell my niggas bye
Hate to see my fam and my niggas cry
Bodies dropping Summer to the Winter time
Lotta niggas never see the finish line
If I’m by my lonely I still got it on me
That’s on every nigga I got tatted on me
In the battlefield I lost my brodies
CMOE, Peewee and I lost Jacoby
I will never ever leave my brothers
He got on but he forgot his homies
Know you brothers we all need each other
If I got it then you got it homie
Believe that
All my niggas demons we still on the same shit
Drop 'em,' where the weed at?
150 dream team, all my shooters heat check
And we all on top, I ain’t even peaked yet, huh

[Outro]
No Limit MB, 4L
Ball Like I'm Kobe, the mixtape
R.I.P all my niggas man, free all my niggas man
Shout out my squad
Shout out South Side, you already know



[Intro]
Ayye, ayye, 150 Dream Team, huh

[Verse]
Packs came in, roll a wood to see what the gas like (Posto)
Welcome to the fast life, buy Hemi to see what the dash like
Used to ride Buicks, Tauruses, now I get 10k for choruses
Pull up hoppin' outta foreign shit, splash brothers with me, scorin' shit
Foe nem sluttin' hoes, all on tour shit, fine freak bitches, don't want boring shit
Remember youngins sleeping on the floor shit, check my bank account, my shit enormounis
I mean enormous, big books on me, no thesaurus
I never lied even back when I was broke, these other rappers act C.B.4. shit
Hundred thousand, probably saw like four of them, back up on my shit I need some more of them
Never satisfied, I need millions, niggas sitting 'round, it's civilians
It's civilians, niggas killin' 'em, old ladies, man, even children
Real street nigga, I ain't feelin' it, but when it come to beef, I ain't feeling shit
Niggas say they see the opps, they spilling 'em, everytime they see the opps they missin' 'em
Hit the innocent, go do sentences, we don't play around, lil bro finish 'em
Soberer than a bitch, I ain't been sippin' shit, stacking hundreds, making forties, little shit
Shit ridiculous, used to shop at corner stores with fifty cents, probably died trying not to mention it
I had beef up in my hood like Fifty Cent, but I ain't ever have to make a many man
Know my death was wanted bad,  by many man, so you know I gotta keep it with me then
Forty glizzy with me, come and get me then, kill a nigga
Lord, oh forgive me, foe nem fuck around and get me him
And sometimes, shit, it just remind me of nights at the club again
No security was searching me, you know that I'ma get the burner in
150 Dream Team behind me, always looking grimey
And as far as trouble, we don't want none, but we still a find it
I'm from Chiraq, this the lifestyle, I don't even mind it
Hollows in the forty-five, X.D., beam on the side of it
I can't trust these hoes, see yo house, put niggas right on it
Fuck that bitch in a hotel, kick her out, I put my life on it
I ain't worried about no niggas, you know that I keep my pipe on it
I ain't saying nobody can get me but I see suspicion, I'm right on it
Let a nigga catch me slipping, you know I deserve it
Rather go out in the foreign, on the e-way swervin'
When I die, don't let no pussy niggas in my service
My view be so high in the sky, my phone don't got no service
I get high and think of all them nights when I was serving
Never went through no peer pressure, lived my life on purpose
If you alive and don't get paper, you ain't got no purpose
What the fuck up with the world, everybody savage
Nobody wanna be no doctors, all the shorties get clapped at
Ain't nobody going to college, all of the shorties on SnapChat



[Intro: G Herbo]
Southside on the track, yeah
Gang shit, nigga
Yeah
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, man?
This shit's got the most views out of everything I've ever put up on my shit
That little clip, that shit got a million views
I ain't never got no views on some shit out

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
In the S or the Porsche Carerras somethin'
Fuck twins like Tia and Tamera somethin'
Yeah that boy gettin' bread, Panera, somethin'
Landed in the GT, leer or somethin'
Put Posto in the Air or somethin'
Marry her, she have an affair
I'ma spin that ho like Ferris
Born in the Chi like Ye
But I do crimes like Bump J, I ain't scared of nothin'
Passport stamp, young nigga ran up that sack
Might as well go to Paris, huh?
Woofin, got whacked you embarrassed, huh?
Pussy you act like you scared of somethin'
Gon' and shoot up the terrorists (shoot up the terrorists)
Then they gon' realize it's serious (blah, blah)
I ain't even on that, period (period)
I'm makin' millions, I'm serious (I'm makin' millions)
That money come in various (furious)
Can't count it, I get delirious (delirious)
I bought my mama a mansion (a mansion)
So I can't trip over materials (yeah, yeah)
But I'm still dipped in that fashion
Know I stay drippin', that's period
These niggas drippin', that's period
Nah, they can't find me and I'm serious (serious)
They right behind, I'm serious (serious)
And I'm straight off the 9, now I'm serious
Who you gon' send to fuck with me?
Take stuff from me or from any of mine? Now I'm curious (I'm curious)
Better think 'fore you bust at me
If you miss, I'll slap a 50 and, man, now I'm furious
Dived in that water, dived like Aquarius
Young nigga, we was breakin' the barriers (breakin' the barriers)
If you grabbin' that torch, better carry it (better carry it)
Tryna hide on that porch on some scary shit (fuck yeah)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, "Gang-gang first," you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
"Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried"
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, "Fuck it, no problem, it'll do"
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, "Elliot, bezel it," ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, yeah
Just a little somethin' to it, I ain't even rip the shit
Pull up in a Lamb' or somethin'
Peanut butter whip, yeah, jam or somethin'
Fucked your bitch on cam or somethin'
Pink diamonds think I'm Cam or somethin'



[Intro: Ha Ha Davis + Chance The Rapper]
You don't want zero problems, big fella!
Yep! Igh!

[Refrain: Chance The Rapper]
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?
You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho
My shooters come for free, so

[Refrain: Chance The Rapper & Lil Wayne]
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Niggas please be focused - that Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
'Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam



[Part I: Pusha Man (produced by CeeJ)]

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows
And chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a handful of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Chorus: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame
And your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said, "Come to Papa", she said, "Papa, yes"

[Chorus: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Part II: Paranoia (produced by Nosaj Thing)]

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'mma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Intro]
Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose
I mean, I know I'm pretty cool
My Nitty bag, my kitty boost
I got the juice, I got the juice

[Verse 1]
Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroBois
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!
Wonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stock broker, winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

[Hook]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

[Verse 2]
God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hashtag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!
That one, drown in the juice nigga
Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin pop smash
Hit sensei, master
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe
Been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA

[Hook]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

[Verse 3]
Jugo, you never tasted paper
Tripped, racing yaself tryna' chase the paper
I just faced a Veg-er
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

[Hook]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!

[Chorus 1]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1]
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus 2]
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why did you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus 3: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Outro: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion



[Hook: Jamila Woods + Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Hook: Jamila Woods +  Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
( the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
(Good God)

[Hook: Jamila Woods, Byron Cage + Chance The Rapper)]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up,  (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)

It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

Damn, I'm in so deep, girl
Probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak (IGH!)
Damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you, if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums
Minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh oh oh ohh
You been scratchin', you been fiendin'

[Verse 3: Noname]
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Hook]
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IGH!



[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Angels, na, na, na, na, ah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Chorus: Saba]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

[Post-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

[Chorus: Saba & Chance The Rapper]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam (na, na, na, na)
I got angels
(I got angels) I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Na, na, na, na
I got, I got angels
They was talking "woo woo, this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded

[Post-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got, I got angels

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away

[Intro: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
I am Killmonger
No one's perfect
But no one's worthless
We ain't deservin' of everything Heaven and Earth is
But word is, good, (this is my home)
Said no one's perfect, but no ones worth this
We ain't deservin' of everything heaven and Earth is
But word is, good (Northern California)

[Verse 1: Slimmy B & Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, they better call a paramedic in the street
I got leverage in the street
I'm a California nigga and I'm heavy in the streets
.22 or .23, I'm heavy with the heat
Hit you with this chop, paramedics can't save you (can't save you)
Really in field c'mon bro, I know that ain't you (no, it ain't you)
2018, hell naw, I ain't gon fade you
Gon' paint you, TDE and SOB, we can't lose
Niggas bitch made
That's just somethin' I can't relate to (can't relate to)
Turn on the gang
That's just somethin' that I can't do (no, I can't do)
Fall out over a bitch
That's just somethin' that I can't do (no, I can't do)
Rip every beat I get on, I was made to (I was made to)
This Glock get to growlin', somethin' like a black panther
Tryna touch a mil, fuck sayin "get yo bands up"
Fuckin' with the gang, yeah, I had to man up
One fist in the air, I ain't finna put my hands up (gang!)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 2: Lul G & Kendrick Lamar]
Got shooters tappin' in, nigga for them bands, nigga
West Coast niggas; yeah, they blowin' fans, nigga
I know I'm the man, baby, bring your friends with you
Puttin' points up while you in the stands, nigga
But I be stuck in these streets, you in the background
Ever since they took my brother, gotta pack rounds
Sorry momma, two bails, took a bad route
I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now
But we been still O.T. on that bullshit (on that bullshit)
I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (empty full clips)
Why these niggas talkin' robbin', they don't do shit
High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit
Bust down on my neck, niggas reach, gettin' stretched
Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
Last year, I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
Now a show 20 or better, broke niggas keep the rest

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 3: DaBoii & Kendrick Lamar]
California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets
If you don't keep a pole how you ready when it's beef
(If you don't keep a pole)
Lil nigga think he cut, yeah, I bet the nigga freeze
If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!

[Verse 4: Yhung T.O. & Kendrick Lamar]
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my grannie and the gangsters
So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask



[Intro]
RBE, SOB that's the gang bitch

[Verse 1: Slimmy B]
MCM backpack, lil nigga bag back
Fuck where that ass at, bitch where that cash at?
Loud when we smokin', lil dope we don't match that
Any sucka nigga slide through, we can clap that
House like we runnin' through that bitch like it's FasTrak
Remember all them days I was broke, but I'm past that
Get the job done when I'm bustin', I don't backtrack
Hit this block with them chops out like it's Baghdad
Shooter like Mad Max, leave a nigga stretched out
All headshots, dumb nigga put that vest down
Beat the pussy up like a young nigga fresh out
Thuggin' with them techs out, I bring the jets out
Niggas ups on a kid, I'll bust a nigga head
These 7.62's knockin' off a nigga's dreads
Money on my mind, all I think about is bread
And tell yo' bitch get off my dick, she keeps tryna give me head
A bunch of young niggas sick with it like 40
350 Yeezy boost, nigga these ain't Roshe's
On my bag flow, I'm tryna bust down a Rollie
My son mom everything, I treat her like a trophy
Pour two fours of that yellow, no Kobe
Got OGs that'll still shoot like Ginobili
A band for my coat like I live where the snow be
And bitch I'm from the Crest where shit gets funky, nigga

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
And that's why I gotta keep a ratchet, bad bitch
Work two jobs and gets taxes
Bought a new Glock, hold 30 like a plasma
All she want is two things, backshots and a backrub
And oh I, oh I, I'm that nigga that will do that
You know I can't lie, love the way that you move that
You know I, know I get that check and run through that
Got one clip, two clips, niggas know I keep two straps
And that's why I'm so anti anti
Can't trust these bitches no can I, can I, oh
And I, and I always keep some shooters on standby, standby, no

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
You fuckin' with a savage
Still remember days I ain't have shit
Everything designer, I don't match it
A band and ten cents for these shoes if you tax it
You ain't fuckin' with a boss nigga
Don't touch, don't ask how much these cost nigga
Just know I, know I got tints so dark can't see no eyes, both eyes

[Outro: Yhung T.O.]
And that's why I'm so anti anti
Can't trust these bitches no can I, can I, oh
And I, and I always keep some shooters on standby, standby



[Intro: Lul G]
RBE, SOB man that's the gang man

For you other niggas, I ain't fuckin' wit'
(RBESOB that's the gang bitch!)

[Verse 1: DaBoii]
What you fuck niggas sayin'?
Glock in the party, I be strapped like a gay bitch
Niggas lane changin', don't know where they lane is
I carry big bills, nah nigga I ain't changin'
Slide down, lil' nigga that's a trespass
Named the whip Ralph, with them straps we'll wreck that
Throw a dime with the Glock, like a chest pass
A nigga run up, big shells where his legs at
Strictly Only Brothers, if you not you irrelevant
Big clips, longer than the trunk of an elephant
A nigga stressed out, pourin' 4's for the medicine
Circle like a dot, where a white bitch freckles is
Get paid, fuck beef, nigga get paid
Cops come, lil' bro...switch lanes
Uppercase, young nigga tote a big k
And all our guns hoes, run up nigga get laid

[Verse 2: Lul G]
Speakin' down on a nigga you a ho nigga (You a bitch!!)
Why you lyin', actin' like you totin' poles nigga (You ain't)
Catch you lackin', guarantee it's a score nigga (Boom Boom)
Talkin' all that cash shit, but you broke nigga ( You Broke)
Watch we send fucks out to some fuck niggas (You a bitch)
Learn the sound when them hollows get to bust nigga (Boom Boom)
Some nigga's gettin' visits, others is bitchin'
All you hear is body droppin' and them the cuffs click
SOB the gang, all my niggas with the shit
I'll bust at a opp, and i'll bust at a bitch
No drive-by's 'cause my niggas tryna' scope
Young nigga with the shrek, 'cause you trippin' with the pole (Tear It Off)
Shit real in these streets, you gotta play it right
Don't let the bitch be the reason why you lose yo' life
Never lyin' on this shit, I'ma tell the truth
I ain't gon' rock wit' that boot, if i ain't gon' shoot

[Verse 3: Slimmy B]
These niggas can't stand us
LOL for what though?
'Cause we the reason nigga's main bitches gettin' fucked on
Keep a small circle, new niggas I can't trust those
These bitches fuck whoever bill's bigger, so it's fuck hoes
I go down and they get me in that room, I'm on hush-mode
North Vallejo turf nigga, Crestside, cutthroat
XD-s, Gluco's, Draco's we bust those
And every nigga that I call brother, I'll bust for
Shooter's everywhere, get you smacked for a softdown
Leanin' off this 2-Liter Sprite, like the cough man
Fuck talkin', slide through and get to sparkin'
This funk, will have you niggas MIA like the Dolphins
SOB the gang, we the niggas talkin' cash shit
G got that K, quick to make a nigga backflip
Woodgrain chop, but I'm rockin' wit' this plastic
And money blue or green, I'll get it out a fat bitch, nigga!

[Verse 4: Yhung To]
Ever since day one, I been the same nigga
Please, don't, confuse me for a lame nigga
30 shot's in that Glock, wit' no aim nigga
11 shot's in that stock, sprayin' paint nigga
Circle got small, I can't trust niggas
Bitch I been a hot nigga since a young nigga
Took a loss, but you neva' seen me run nigga
Thought I'm dumb nigga, 'till his face meet this drum nigga
10 deep in the foreign, ridin' back to back
Catch a opp nigga slippin, runnin' lap to lap
All blue's in my loaf, nigga stack to stack
And she gon' do all my bro's, nigga back to back
Ha...yea nigga's know the gang nigga
Talk shit when it's diamonds in yo' chain nigga?
All chrome 32, had to tuck that
Two-tone .380, had to bust that
Upgraded to that Glock, bitch don't touch that
And it ain't on my hip, if I won't bust that
Clutchin' in the party nigga clutch back
Put that barrel to his face, blow his buff's back
Make a nigga strip..like a thot bitch
Call that chop Ray Rice how it drop shit
Doin' pop-ups, mom's house, tec shots, two Glocks, headshots, Young Money "Bed Rock"
Man's turned on me, so he gotta catch a leg shot
Fuck cops, fuck opps, 40 in the tuk spot
Bitches want a nigga off they fame, I can't trust thots
SOB the gang, wit' more chops than a gunshop
Bitch

[Outro: Lul G]
Ahhh 30's, 50's, 100's bitch we got 'em

Talk shit when it's diamonds in yo' chain bitch

Allergic to a snake they like boy stop dabbin
These niggas want my head, chop won't stop blastin'
Nigga be cautious, shout out to T.O
All white buffs O-M-G, think I'm Deebo
Bro got that chop, clip longer than a peacoat
Two chops get to singin' like Michael and Tito
Middle fingers to the feds they lockin' all my niggas up
Strip a officer for his badge, make him give it up
Nah I'm playin, keep ya badge we don't give a fuck
Vallejo, California where them youngin's they be quick to bust
Ruthless!
We don't really give a fuck nigga

Circle got small, I don't really like to trust niggas
Shoutout all my niggas, S-O-B it's just us nigga!

[Hook]

[Pre-Hook: Yhung T.O.]
Hold on hold on, nigga back back

[Hook: Yhung T.O.]
We them niggas talkin' cash shit
Broke nigga close yo' mouth cause I ain't asked shit

Green twenties blue hundreds in the mattress
Fuck around and make that cash flip
Back in the days I ain't had shit
They say I'm actin' different how I'm actin'
They say I'm actin' different how I'm actin'

[Verse 1: DaBoii]
Lil nigga I'ma eat who I starve with
Niggas really hoes, lil nigga stop barkin'
These hoes they be throwin' up my gang like they barfin'
Bro got that chop, lil nigga be cautious
Circle got small, no fuck niggas
Strictly only brothers if you not I don't trust niggas
Pockets full of knots, but with you it ain't much in it
Niggas want beef, LOL I just touch chicken
Bitch where that cash at?
Broke, nah I'm passed that
Offerin' the neck, nah bitch I already had that
Jeans where I sag at, .40 in the backpack
House to the neck, blowin' pounds like a hashtag
A nigga try to rob me, foolish
Bro in the back sendin' shots at Medulla's
Where his brain at? He don't know, left him clueless
And I don't fuck with snakes, but my belt that's Medusa

[Pre-Hook: Yhung T.O.]
Hold on hold on, nigga back back
We them niggas with that cash ain't gotta ask that

[Verse 2: Yhung T.O.]
She said she love me, I can't trust that
My niggas bust first, we don't bust back
I'd be a fuckin' fool if I cuffed that
She tellin' me she down for me well I suggest you up that
Same fit everyday cause I'm trappin'
Bad bitch on both sides got me trapped in
Thought they caught a mac lackin'
Run up, catch this Mac 10
SOB, bitch we locked in
Do what the fuck I want cause I'm poppin'
Buy what the fuck I want when I'm shoppin'
Red on the bottoms, got these fuck niggas plottin'

[Hook: Yhung T.O.]
We them niggas talkin' cash shit

They say I'm actin' different how I'm actin'



[Verse 1: Kiing Rod]
Broke as I was
Now I walk with a bank roll
Stackin' my chips
Never worry about a dumb hoe
13 on my pants
Fuck around and hit the tango
Got it on my own
I ain't never beg for shit hoe
Got no attention for a broke ass bitch
All this god damn designer
Got me feelin' like I'm rich
Now I hop out the foreign, with a bag on my wrist
If you ain't payin' you delayin'
Get the fuck out my whip
10 bands out the bitch, VVS on my wrist
Red bottoms on yo bitch
While she taking all these trips
To the same young nigga,that's just tryna get rich
And I'm talking cash shit
Come fuck with the bus down
Better catch up lil nigga
Cause I'm up now
Plottin' on a wraith, can't wait 'til it touch down
My first 100k goin' straight to my momma now
It's strictly only brothers
If you not you get knockdown, nigga

[Chorus: Benny]
You know how I do it
I spray 30 rounds
Ain't no name on these bullets
You see lately I been goin' through it
I'm chasing this paper, riding 'round in the scraper
Ready to knockdown
Anybody thinkin' they on top now
You gettin' knocked down
If you ain't gang, you get knocked down

[Verse 2: Mike Sherm]
That hating shit like Cancer
You don't cure it, you gon' die from it
I don't look for funk
But you ain't finna see me hide from it
Bitch niggas hatin' cause they say that it's my time comin'
Hit the show with shooters
Just wish a nigga would try something
Money in my circle
Bitch we strictly 'bout the bank roll
G-Bo that's my cousin
But we something like the bang bros
We the ones extorting we don't really like to save hoes
Yo bitch call me daddy, when her ass gettin' spanked on
Benji's, don't ever give her shit, cause I'm stingy
Ain't trippin' off a bitch I got plenty
I fuck her off my name
You can't even fuck her off the Henny
I been touched 10 and I just turned 20
Fuck a bitch
I really love money
A pretty broke bitch hella ugly
I can't love a bitch
They only want a nigga cause I'm buzzin'
I only fuck wit' her when I'm fucking, bitch


[Chorus]
You know how I do it
I spray 30 rounds
Ain't no name on these bullets
You see lately I been goin' through it
I'm chasing this paper, riding 'round in the scraper
Ready to knockdown
Anybody thinkin' they on top now
You gettin' knocked down
If you ain't gang, you get knocked down

[Verse 3: Benny]
Knock Down
When it comes to the guns we got Manni like Pacquiao
40' with the stock couple bodies gettin' caught now
You hangin' out the window
While I'm ridin' with the top down
Been thuggin respect how I live
Chop got kick you were something like a square
Now you rock wit' a clique
Full of snakes, full of squids
Get spanked wit' a six
Big tank for ya crib, ooh
10-4 hit the Lil bro then the big hoes
Foreign case, loose waist, iced neck, wrist froze
One lil bitch gone
Cell, text switch phones
Fuck a nigga diss song
Whips gettin' bipped on
I'm that nigga in the streets like a speed bump
Had to hit the weight room
Had to beast up
Now we in big place, where they feast up
Couple ninas
Couple niggas throwin' C's up

[Chorus: Benny]
You know how I do it
I spray 30 rounds
Ain't no name on these bullets
You see lately I been goin' through it
I'm chasing this paper, ridin' round in that scraper
Ready to knockdown
Anybody thinkin' they on top now
You gettin' knocked down
If you ain't got it, you get knocked down



[Intro]
Joe...what are you doing here? What are you doing here? What are you doing here?

[Verse 1: DaBoii]
Bitch!
Get off on who you mad at
Niggas laughin', we is down, now they laughed at
Bitch swallow all my kids, I'm a bad dad
Lookin' for revenge with this Glock, once we tap tap
Stitch brain on the opps watch 'em quack, quack
Indian giver with his life, he can't have back
He ain't putting in work, he a half ass
Can't ride the wave, go on home with your bag packed
Bitch! What type of shit is you on?
Yeah, that's your bitch but my dick, she be on
8 in a liter, when I sip it be strong
Ain't tryna chase a bag? Dumb bitch then be gone
Offense with them straps, you gon' need D
Want beef with the gang? You gon' need cheese
John Cena with them tints, you can't see me
Fuck the law, catch a case, nigga free Theeze
If I gotta think twice, I won't think at all
Bitch we want all smoke, ain't no peace at all
Treat the ops like a blunt, I'll chief 'em all
Before you play in that field, nigga kick balls
Bitch!
Yeah, and we is not playin'
You know DaBoii, he a beast you can not tame him
Take a chain round this neck, you are not able
Whole gang full of demons, we are not angels
House visit with the chop, that's who rock cradle
All the eyes on us, but we not cable
Stand tall through it all, but we not tables
Niggas wanna play? Game on ‘cause we not playful

[Verse 2: Slimmy B]
Bitch!
Who the fuck gon' stop me?
All this ice on, who the fuck gon' rob me?
Hundred shooters wit' me, who the fuck gon' try me?
High off the kush, in the clouds you can find me
I don't fuck with niggas like a Nazi
If nobody else, then I know God got me
Hi-Tech turn a nigga to a zombie
And I don't want the puss, lil' baby just top me (gimme head)
I'll set it off in this bitch
Feel like Rick Ross, I'm the boss in this bitch
Smack for a band, don't get bought in this bitch
Make you bulletproof the whip, like Young Dolph in that bitch (boom, boom)
Touch a hundred bands, yeah I did that
Hit the lot, couple bands, yeah I did that
This street shit? Naw nigga, you don't live that
Aid or a kick back, real nigga been that (lil' nigga)
LV and Gucci, had to mismatch
And for the right price, you can get your bitch back
Tired of them broke niggas? I can fix that
Just bought a Glock hit the plug, where them sticks at?
Get to bustin' have you niggas runnin', zig-zags (boom, boom)
Hit the road, get the bag, then I flip that
All the time my brother got, he can't get back
But I got bands for him tucked when he get back
All these styles a nigga got, I'll switch it up
When you jump in these streets, ain't no givin' up
Big .40, I'll make a nigga give it up
And nigga reach for this chain, I'ma hit 'em up
Crazy when you see your day ones switchin' up
Crazy when you see the opp niggas clickin' up
Fuckin' on a ho bitch? You niggas sick as fuck
And if it ain't about a bag, I ain't pickin' up bitch

[Verse 3: Yhung T.O.]
First off, suck a nigga dick
Pole for a opp, come an suck a nigga clip
Clip so long, that it's poking off my hip
If I wasn't taken, I'd take a nigga bitch
Am I really insane? (Yeah bitch it's true)
Six figures to my name? (Yeah bitch it's true)
Heard I don't fuck with you? (Yeah bitch it's true)
Fuck what you thought, fuck what you knew
I'm a gold diggin' nigga, need a check out a bitch
I'll pass her to the gang, they get neck out the bitch
You was textin' like you with it, what you scared for?
Let me hit it from the back, break the headboard
If not, I don't give a fuck
I got diamonds in my mouth, when I talk bitches lust
Fuck it up sus, nigga gettin' at me wrong, I’ll fuck 'em up sus
Chop with a drum, cook fuckin' up my lungs
Cops looking for the Glock, 'cause they think a nigga dumb
You would never see me posin' with another nigga funds
You would never see me clutchin' on another nigga gun
Bitch I'm a soldier, I don't got no limit
I'm a foreign car driver, I don't ride no Civic
I'm a wild ass nigga and I don't act civil
I don't smoke no kush, I don't smoke no skittles
Addicted to them racks, I’m a motherfuckin' thief
All these bands still hangin' out my motherfuckin' jeans
Give a nigga all head 'til its barely dome
I been running at that bag 'til it's barely gone
Let a nigga hit like I'm Barry Bonds
And I don't fuck with niggas, I'm a Uncle Tom
Four-five on my hip but I'll tote a .9
And if you ever take my bitch she was barely mine

[Outro]
RBE SOB that's the gang bitch



[Intro: Clyde the Mack]
I'll just warm it up dawg
Check this out
This for all my young niggas out here right right
Keep your mind on the money nigga
All that baller blockin' have you niggas doin'
That shit old as fuck nigga
Get yo ass out there, chase the bag nigga

[Verse 1: DaBoii]
Lil nigga stay humble, put your pride to the side
And your nigga, he a snake if he lie in your eyes
Heard niggas want me gone, so I ride wit' the 9
I was fuckin' wit' a duck, now I ride wit' a dime
For you niggas cuffin' hoes, we the thieves, you the jakes
And I hardly ever smile 'cause I mean what I say
Baby sorry if I'm rude, I ain't mean girl, I'm straight
If she fiendin' for the dick, need a fee when I lay it
I ain't worried 'bout a ex, tell a bitch that she ain't shit
Posted on the block wit' my niggas I be gangin'
Niggas ain't a hunnid, on my life they be changin'
They'll claim they all real, on my life they be prankin'
For thinkin' you the shit when you not, bitch you gettin' dropped
Give a bitch my time? Nah bitch I ain't givin' clock
Give a bitch the boot wit' no ride, got her kickin' rocks
Little nigga but I ride around wit' the biggest Glock
I don't like niggas
I one night bitches
You will never be a boss, too much pride in ya
Nigga stay humble, keep your pride distant
I just took a nigga bitch, somebody wife missin'
Everybody talkin' down, I ain't mindin' it
All this dope got my mind missin'
Broke nigga take my bitch, that's a plot twister
Don't do that crime if you ain't ready for that life sentence
I ain't even gettin' babby 'cause I'm all up in her gut
And these niggas really phony I ain't into givin' trust
I be fading out the bullshit, I ain't into givin' fucks
And I'm in too deep I ain't never givin' up
Bitch I'm in my own lane I don't swerve but you suckas do
Brought the whole bank, all birds I be touchin' blues
Talk about a bitch, if I fuck, brody fuckin' too
Day ones only, if you not, I don't fuck wit' you
Granny always told me, "You a boss, put your mind to it"
Look me in my eye and say you ridin' and you lied to it
Reason why I win 'cause back then I ain't mind losin'
Be wit' all dogs, nah nigga, I don't like humans
Niggas mergin' in our lane, get your blinker broke
And when we see these niggas out, think they seen a ghost
And wit' these buffs on my face I can't be approached
Bitch I don't feed into shit 'cause y'all be a joke
SOB bitch nah nigga you can't touch this
Me givin' a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is
Pops doin' time since then I ain't cuff shit
They mad 'cause we get it out the mud so it's fuck pigs
Lil nigga 19, I be cashin'
Heart made of steel so I ride wit' the plastic
Niggas say they real, oh my God that's a catfish
Ain't even hit it once, to my bro I'ma pass it
Niggas talkin' crazy they must wanna put they life at risk
If I catch a case I never panic, bitch I'm fightin' it
Gotta keep the .40 for them bustas, I ain't fightin' shit
Say you really love me yeah I bet, you little lyin' bitch
Brody see a stain on your neck, get your shit snatched
Call the cops and please, niggas won't get they shit back
Soon as I appear, niggas won't get they bitch back
Tellin' in the station and you won't get your lips back
Fuck a 9 to 5, on the block I be thuggin'
Bitch I'm that nigga, you can tell how I'm muggin'
Middle fingers to the haters, give a fuck, I be thumbin'
I be lyin', playin' games wit' her head like a Russian
Dumb nigga, and my jeans keep some hunds in them
Would strip your nigga but his pockets ain't got nut in it
She gon' have to take a Plan B if I nut in it
Start shit wit' us he gon' end up wit' none finished



[Intro]
Heard some niggas want me gone, tell me who they shootin' at
I see a third I'm shootin' first, ain't no need of shootin' back
Fell out with my cousin, had to go and get my shooter back
Been gettin' money, but this fame shit, we new to that

[Chorus]
But please don't get this shit twisted
On my momma, it ain't hard to come up missin'
On my momma, I ain't with none of that dissin'
On my momma, on my momma
Bitch this Glock got an extension

[Verse 1]
And I can't trust these niggas
I'm in love with you girl, I can't trust these bitches
I just hope you understand that I'm different
I'ma ride for you, I'ma really really ride for you
When that time come, I'll really really die for you
My life real in these streets, I can't lie to you
But I made a promise, I'll always make it home to you
Can't let a fuck nigga take me
I be gettin' money so these fuck niggas hate me
But baby please don't let a nigga down
I'm so tired of fake shit, I'm so tired of breakin' down
And I want you right now, and I don't want these fuck niggas around
And I'll empty out the whole round right now
And I will, I will, I will
Vow to keep my steel
I know your secrets, you're not real
On tour ridin' with that Glock still
They say I'm famous now
I'm ridin' with that Glock still

[Chorus]
On my momma, bitch we trippin'
On my momma, niggas tellin', they be snitchin'
On my momma, I be ballin' like a sixer
On my momma, on my momma
Bitch this Glock got an extension

[Verse 2]
And I don't do this for me
I just wanna move my grandma out the V
Just wanna have a family with you baby
I just hope your fam accepts me for me
I been out here really in the field, not by choice
I'm just tryna find a way, I'm just tryna have a voice
My dad was never there, I'm just tryna have a boy
So I could give him the life that I could never afford
'Cause shit real nigga, I been really in the field nigga
Livin' day by day, and day by day niggas get killed nigga
Keep it real nigga, I just wanna make a mil nigga
Make my girl smile, big house on the hill nigga
And that's the main reason I don't trust niggas
I know they hate to see me winnin' so it's fuck niggas
Glock on me right now that's for you tough niggas
And the baddest bitches set you up so I don't lust bitches

For them bands I make a nigga strip now days
Even though a nigga on, no I still won't change
These new niggas they ain't keepin' it a hunnid
I swear these streets and they take a nigga conscious
We ain't runnin' we the ones doin' the huntin'
Merkin' niggas skrt off doin' a hunnid
On the next block, speed limit, drive regular
We ain't talkin feds tappin' in the cellulars

At some point, you gotta notice niggas amateurs
And I don't got time to be fuckin' wit' you

So I promise to catch a body when I run into you

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]

Always be thug, nigga never go south

If a nigga run up trippin' I'ma catch a body proudly
The realest nigga sometimes can even turn fakes
Seen a lot shit change when the fuckin' cake came
Crestside C's up but I don't fuckin' gangbang
And if a sucka slide bustin' I'ma do the same thing
Ain't fuckin' wit' you niggas 'cause you niggas too strange
TEC on my neck, hangin' on a shoestring

Real duffle bag boy like that nigga 2 Chainz

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I never leave my brothers, I never hold out
Always be thug nigga, never go south
Keep both eyes open, I know niggas go now

Gucci Gang fuck twin sisters
When I get a check, yeah, they call me mister
Call Mary Kate, wanna fuck her sister

You just flow on a track and you kill that
And you thought you had the sauce but you spilled that
Put a hundred in the safe like at Chase Bank
Nigga, run up on me, see my bad side
Got a bad bitch and a backside
All this water on me like I'm baptized
They be switchin' gang, stay on that side
Bitch, I'm Lil Purpp, do a lot of fraud

Go to Saks Fifth, spend like thirty bands
Walkin' out of Gucci with a Louis bag

[Chorus]
Smokin' on a doink, can ya smell that?
Put a hundred bands in a duffle bag
Pulled up in a Ghost, where the roof at?
Gucci from my toe to my durag

Lil' Purpp really got the bands up

Why the fuck this bitch texting my phone?
You're not my girlfriend

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Ridin' through the city, I ain't know that she was with it
She was tryna get with me so I had to get busy
See I met her at the Lenox, she was tryna buy some Jimmy's
And that ass like Serena like she had to play tennis, ayy
Swervin' on corner like skrrt (skurrrrt)
She said, "Can I text you?" I'm like sure (surrrre)
And I got on Gucci like burr
Shawty you gon' have to shave the fur (cut it off)
And I might come ballin' like I'm Stephen Curry
Space Jam, Bill Murray, Munchies, Oreo McFlurry, whoa
I can't even lie, shawty thick and she purty
Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on that pole
I ain't even know that's your girlfriend
I'ma pass her like I'm Kyrie Irving
I'ma just take trips to Berlin
Why you tryna flex like you a virgin?

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
Get out my lane, that's candy paint
Took out the brain, I'm at the flame
We not the same, Louis V frame
Look where I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby Ion't even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame
I can't even do it, babe, sorry, I can't even lie
Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
She said, "Can I come again?" Maybe, girl, another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly?
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
I just hit yo girl in my Polo Pajamas tho
Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho
And she thick and she pretty (like who?) like Amber Rose

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I'm a CEO in the makin'
They don't really want me to make it
Fuck that shit, I'ma take it
In high school, I wore Asics
Then I brought back new New Balance
I wear them in 2013
Make a nigga crank that pool pass
Know my niggas come out with that FFN
Kick the door down 'cause they gon' let me in
Treat my partners like brothers, I don't got no friends
I been swimmin' with sharks and I don't got no fins
If you knew where I came from, I'm not with the game
You gotta watch out for your enemies
Even your friends be your frenemies
Fuck all that cappin', you 'posed to be kin to me
Fuck all that sad shit, I don't show no sympathy
Fuck a color, I just wanna get green
Get the profits, split it up with the team
Swear that's why I had to roll up my jeans
I'm a rapper slash actor, might be on your screen
They must not know where I came from
Sacrifices, had to make some
Only eat with the ones who were with me before I had shit
Dare you to say somethin', these be my day ones

[Chorus: Kap G]
We came from nothin', can't tell me nothin'

Pull up on that bitch and hit from behind
Told my partners, we gon' see better times
How the hell we gon' get left behind?
We upper echelon, we gon' get rich or die tryin'
Change up my line
Naw fool
Hol' up, I'm tryna wet her food
Daddy got locked by them cops
Man, he stood on that block, he was sellin' that dog food
Fuck what them niggas gon' call you
Broke is what they never call you
Once car for one of my niggas
Man, best believe all of them bitches gon' fall through
N-n-n-n-n-n-naw fool, these niggas sound like some house shoes
I just be drippin' that Ragu, you cannot cuff me like the cops do
And I'ma reply like a boss too
And I answer all like a boss too
I just wanna buy my own house, fool
And I'ma just trap out the house, fool, you dig?
Fuck, gon' drink it away
Y'all call them cops, they pigs
Put this shit all in a blunt
Y'all smokin' cigs, that ain't it
Dreams on big, blunt on big
Bad bitch with me but she ain't shit

[Chorus: Kap G]
We came from nothin', can't tell me nothin'

They used to be frontin', now we do no lovin'

Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want

[Verse 1]
Spice Girl, freaky lil mama
Said she on a diet so she only eat bananas
Always in your prime, other women don't align
And when I'm off work then you know it's bed time
So let's go (hey), let's hit the I-5
Get away from B.S., don't waste no down time (hey)
I don't ever like 'em boujee, that's the type that wanna sue me
And when we get together, hit it like viva forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Do I have a chance or am I pavin' ways?
I'm tryna find a reason not to say your name
Like you, there's no look-a-like

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world

British girl (hey)
Got a show in London
Won't you come around? Put you on the list, it's nothin'
Say you gotta work 'cause you're studyin' for Masters
Yeah, these women fine but only on the camera (ooh)
They deceivin', super thievin'
They feelings come and go like when they weave in
I never listen to the schemin' type
I want the Sporty, Scary, Ginger spice

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Do I have a chance or am I pavin' ways?
I'm tryna find a reason not to say your name

[Outro]
My girl's a Spice Girl
Her world's my world
And most of all she's fine to me
And aligned with the infatuation I feel
I need a Spice Girl



[Verse 1: Aminé]
Walking on the pavement I chipped my pride and my teeth on
The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down
The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howl when the train...
Comes like my ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl, wanted me a Nextel
But my momma copped a Razr, that's why I couldn't blame her
Flippin' through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kickin' out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better
These are the only days I missed, like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams, now I dream

[Chorus: Aminé]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do, they'll finally see the inner me

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car
Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time
Never trip with the law
The popo up in PO dirtier than BO
Bullies from the past act like I'm they fucking hero, uh
Livin' in LA for the weather, I FaceTime mom when I miss her
I got some homies that'll never leave my hometown
When I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus
I told 'em I don't smoke, they say "Boy, you fuckin' wildin'"
Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb
Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun

[Chorus: Aminé]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do, they'll finally see the inner me

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Mentality the same from my folks
Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke
I sip red wine, sauvignon, Rastafar, Babylon
My youth will never die if I live it like a prize (hey!)
Who knows who I am, who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Everytime I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure

[Interlude: Recording]
(I cut the first night, we fuck around, I put my finger in her bootyhole 'cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes. A-a-and then...)

[Bridge (Spoken): Aminé]
I slip and slide through the times in my youth
What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream
What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some
What's the age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touché

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Aminé]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do, they'll finally see the inner me

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, ooh
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah
Oo yeah-eah-eah-eah
Ohhhh hmm
Ohhhh hmm
Hmm
Hmm

[Intro: Aminé]
I was duped, didn't know the truth
Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo
And now I'm feeling cool, I'm feeling brand new
I would pay a lot to be the nigga in my shoes (Who this for?)

[Chorus: Aminé]
This is dedicated to my ex-lovers
Hope that you hear this, never find another

Hope that you hear this, never find another
Me and my friends, we don't worry or pretend
Hope you play this at your wedding
Yeah, the one I won't attend (Sike)

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Vultures at the altar, tell the pastor to watch his back
My girl said she wanted change and then she got a quarterback
Well, damn, I ain't no football player
But I hit it harder than a football player
The girl of my dreams just became a girl
And well, we can talk about that later
Honeymoon in your hometown, bitch, you broke now
Your mama ask about me almost every week
He can speak in tongue, talkin' bout "Forever hold your peace"
I said peace, please hurry up and kiss so I can eat, mmm
Tootsie roll and your tippy toes
So much soul that my soul got soul
Your auntie and uncle, they love me
All your bridesmaids wanna fuck me
Your groom look like a broom and it make me "hahaha"
Girl, I coulda been your Pap and you be my Remy Ma (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Offset]
I was duped, didn't know the truth (truth)
Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo

(Sike)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Yes, I've been balling, yeah, Maybachs to Lambos and 'Raris, yeah
Fresh in that Cartier, take off your clothes, we get naughty, yeah
Whole party lit, bad bitches everywhere (lit!)
Gang in this bitch, Nawf Side extraordinaire (gang!)
Pipe up the city, the diamonds gon' light up the city
I got your girl on the low
I slide in it and then I'ma dive in it, I got her selling her soul (soul!)
Pick up five bags in a row (bags!)
White diamonds look like the Pope (Pope!)
Gucci Python on the loafers
Yeah, my pinky look just like the ocean
It's colder, North Dakota, from the bowl to the chauffeurs
Having fun in a Rollster, in Milan copping Goyard, yeah!
(Woo woo woo woo) Now that I'm taking over
Your hand out, but I don't owe ya, I came from the dirt, soil

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & (Offset)]
I was duped, didn't know the truth (truth)
Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo
And now I'm feeling cool (cool!), I'm feeling brand new
I would pay a lot to be the nigga in my shoes (Who this for?)

[Chorus: Aminé & (Offset)]

[Intro: Rickey Thompson]
Sad on your muthafuckin b-day? Bitch, what the fuck?! Don’t you realize you poppin'? Every time you walk in the room you break necks. Necks?! But you tellin' me you sad on your muthafuckin' b-day?

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I sit here and tell you my problems, that’s how this work, right?
I’m s’posed to be open and honest, but I got time, right?
My niggas having seshes and I’m doin' sessions
Can’t man up if masculinity your only weapon
Man, I’ve thought about suicide a hundred times
But, I'd hate to disappoint and see my momma cry
Birthdays these days be the worst days
'Cause I know I’m gettin' older and not happier
Me and my father love each other but we barely show it
He hates that I left home and the lawn is now his to mow it
He look at my generation and think that fashion's over
I kill my sister if she ever model Fashion Nova (true)
I'm always on a flight, or I'm in a hurry (yeah)
I miss when losin' my virginity was my only worry (yeah)
Back when puttin' on a condom had me really scary (scare)
And milkshakes were the only time we'd eat a cherry
I think learnin' how to eat pussy from someone who eat pussy
Is better than learnin' from someone who doesn't
And that's word to my ex and that's word to my tongue (yeah)
And that's word to the woman
Who had my heart beatin' drums (drums, drums)
Yeah, love is what I cherished and Miss Parrish (yeah)
Flew all the way to Paris and we made out on my terrace (yeah)
I kept it on the low low, 'cause I was in love (love)
And the shade I had in my room was already enough ('nuff)
I'm goin' on some dates and I'm makin' some plans
But it's hard to find some love if the girl is a fan (fan)
And after we fuck, she want a picture with me
She got me feeling like Paper Boi, but I cry when she leaves, yeah

[Chorus: Aminé]
These intros ain't meant to be bangers
They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever
I said, I said, these intros ain't meant to be bangers
They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever

[Interlude]
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, woo
Yes sir, yeah, look

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Boy, you lookin' big mad
When you see a young brotha up in first class (yee!)
And you damn right my ego like Lavar Ball (yuh)
They hate to see a black man who can't get blackballed (skrr!)
I said my paper long (yuh), my paper long (yuh)
You damn right, bitch (bitch), my paper long
It's that yellow, mellow, fellow, yeah, that Yellowstone (hey!)
Play the cello for the fellows, fake as silicone (true!)
I went from plaque in my teeth to havin' plaques on the wall
Gold album with platinum records
Who woulda thought? (uh-huh!)
Young nigga, like Jigga, tryna make me a boss
I'll take my momma to Louis and take your girl to the Ross, nigga
Back in the muthafuckin' building (yuh)
Your boo thing want my children (yuh)
My net worth gon' be billions (bih!)
Shorty gimme head like ceiling (true!)
Dick disappear, chameleon (true!)
And like I'm muthafuckin' rollin' (yee!)
My whip bought, it's not stolen (brrr!)

[Chorus: Aminé]
These intros ain't meant to be bangers
They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever, yeah

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Hey doc, do I tell em how I actually feel? (yeah)
Or do I see a therapist and numb the pain with the pills
This for niggas play tough won't even smile in mirrors (nah)
And we learned to fuck hoes off trial and error
Friday nights, where them broke niggas ball out
And Aminé be the name that your girlfriend gon' call out (call out)
To all my niggas with some melanin, let your feelings settle in
If you feelin' worthless (yeah)
You should probably go and tell a friend (tell it)
Yeah, but, I should take that advice
This year has been crazy, what the fuck is my life? (what)
My best friend got married, you can bet that I cried
I met Spike and Brad Pitt, no malls, I'm Saks Fifth, nigga (errr!)

[Outro: Rickey Thompson]
Get your shit together and turn the fuck up!

Gimme OPB for my ODB, these APC, do your ABC's

And I love it when a bitch nigga tryin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake

[Pre-Chorus]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seats so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

[Verse 1]
Wood grain Nada, yes I'm the Baba
Don't rock Prada, what's a stylist
I'd rather make my clothes, merch by the boat load
Banana club popping, yep I'm super biased (true)
Tint so black, look like my complexion
Neo I'm the one like I had direction
Rims look like they were shipped from heaven
Trunk so big it could fit my reverend (yeah!)
And that nigga's pretty big
Engine so fast, every block is a trip
Baby girl wished that I copped the two seater
But I had to get five 'cause my niggas want to ride

[Pre-Chorus]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seat so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

[Verse 2]
Looking out my rearview, all I see is haters (hatin')
This is just a preview, I'll use my gas for later (maybe!)
Black ice, black seats, yeah I'm bumping Blackstar
Rednecks tell me that I got a nice car
Gotta make sure that I keep my baby clean
This game keep me hungry like I'm Katniss Everdeen
Just got the whip washed
Shining like it's pish-posh
Engine sound like it needs an ad-lib from Rick Ross
No I ain't M.M.G
But my next purchase might be an M3 (sheesh)
Sicker than most, look at the folk
Trippin for dollars so holler for gold
Picking apart my problems
Like when Peter Piper picked his nose
Whip looked like it got dipped in a cherry coat
Mercedes' same color as the hair on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type



[Intro: Sample]
"You no-business, born-insecure, junkyard motherfucker!"

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Campfire—I'm a hot motherfucker
Please, no pictures, I'm a tired motherfucker
Spidey senses tingle when it's fake niggas
Dreads swinging like they did the Harlem shake, nigga, that's true
West Coast 'til I d-i-e
If you want respect, look me in my e-y-e
I love my whips like a racist and travel lot of places
Free my nigga, Hef, fuck the police
Uh, Oprah for President, CLBN resident
Thizz-Face when I'm disgraced—that's the nigga in me
Might catch me at a Whole Foods
And if you see that red Mercedes, then you know who

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 2: Ritchie with a T]
Yeah, yeah, campfire—I'm a scary lil' nigga
This run in my blood like Drew Barrymore, nigga
And my fit on ET, yo 'shit on EBT
So when you try to flex, I'm like, "What's yo' credit score, nigga?"
Yeah, and that's word to my granny
Since 14, knew the route like Randy
Everything dandy, gray sweats with the Pennys
Nausea, heartburn, side effects may vary
Yeah, fuck these niggas, where the child lock?
So many hits, I could have my own NOW! comp
Pen a triple album full of all my children
No difference from Kidz Bop, book 'em in the Hilton

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch



[Intro]
Ay man, say man
We starting to get really tired all that, all that hoopty hollering
Whoopty whoo, blaze blah y'all been talking lately, man
Go somewhere with all that, man, for real, shut up, shut up
All that talking y'all been doing man, for real
"I'ma do this, I'ma do that," ugh

[Verse 1]
Every day you're talking, every day you're in my ears
And every time we fighting, I gotta go and wipe your tears
'Cause if I don't do, you gon' throw your problems on me
And then we'll fuss and fight when I just really wish you'd...

[Chorus]
Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it
Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggerating
Shut the fuck up, just have some patience
Shut the fuck up, quit giving me hell

[Verse 2]
We keep locking eyes, petty so you're silent
You keep talking signs, heart is in the science
Sleep, weep, don't cry on me, don't die on me
All up in my face with the oochie wally wally
Sounding like girls at a party on the molly
I ain't tryna link or build
Bubble space, bubble space, still, nigga, chill (Move)
Oh, you got a chain? Sick
Oh, you got some fame? Sick
Got a new Rolex and you knew he had to flex
'Cause the hoes gon' check
500K in my stash
Why you flex the only couple hundreds that you have?
Screw needing security for your insecurity
Calling niggas broke, you should choke on your own words
Name dropping, pic cropping, dick hopping, bill dodging
Boy, you know who you are
Man, why you wanna try so hard?
Be yourself, be yourself and please

[Chorus]
Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it
Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggerating
Shut the fuck up, just have some patience
Shut the fuck up, get out my head

[Bridge]
I'm waiting my whole life, but I'm tired, tired of wishing for you
I'm waiting patiently, but my mischief wishing for something new

[Verse 3]
Money come right back, never had to fight that
But I come back, back
Thought it was a night cap, life hit a hijack
Girl, let's be face, face
Heartbreak Drake for my first heartbreak
I was 17 and I made mistakes
Went to dances but I never did dance
Got pretty fly, but I never did pan
Now I'm 23, loving and learning from all the lovers that I see
Nissan babes with the body burgundy
Love my car same way I used to love key
Friends need a Uber, sis need tuition
Fans want the music, but they want a politician
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure
Shut the fuck up, I don't need the extras
Spice girls sitting in the red Mercedes
Attitude like I'm tryna have your babies
But I ain't tryna have no babies
No, I ain't tryna have no baby

[Outro]
Been waiting my whole life but I'm tired
Tired of wishing for you
I'm waiting patiently but my mischief
Wishing for something new



[Chorus: LA Priest]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

[Verse 1: Amine]
I fucked things up, I see it in this cup (Yeah)
I didn't mean to suck, I'm stuck
Sometimes I'm just too honest (Sorry), admittin' that it's common
I should've used my common sense
So now I've gots to vent (Yeah)
I can't stand you, but I want you
We s'posed to be together forever

[Pre-Chorus: Amine]
Leakin' from the pain, need a Band Aid (Hey!)
You're the main thing I need to maintain (Whoo!)
Almost had my baby, need a damn drink (Damn drink)
Swimmin' through your feelings, how I stay sane (Stay sane)
You're the one I need, I hope this really works (Really works)
'Cause everything I need is always in your purse (Purse)
Back again, yeah I'm back again (Back)
I truly miss when you and me were only friends (Yee)
When it was just innocent (Yeah)
And we ain't have a past (True)
Sometimes I wish we could skip
To the part where we all just laugh (Yeah)

[Chorus: LA Priest]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

[Verse 2: Amine]
I don't wanna be at your wedding (No)
I wanna be in your wedding (Yuh)
Matter of fact, call Donell Jones
So he can sweedle-dee at your wedding (Sweedle-dee dee dee)
But if this don't work out (Yeah)
I might have to go and work out (Yuh)
Even if I'm late I'ma keep her
I'm a college dropout (True)
I'ma work this all out (Yeah)
I'ma get my thoughts out (Bitch)
I'ma kick them thots out (Yeah)
Block all the numbers so I never get a text out (oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Amine]
Leaking from the pain, need a Band Aid (Band-aid)
You're the main thing I need to maintain (Maintain)
Almost had my baby, need a damn drink (A damn drink)
Swimmin' through your feelings, how I stay sane (I stay sane)
You're the one I need, I hope this really works (Really works)
'Cause everything I need is always in your purse (In your purse)
Back again (Yuh), yeah I'm back again (I'm back)
My life around common, I miss when we were friends (Sorry)
When it was just innocent (Sorry)
And we ain't have a past (Damn)
I wanna skip to the part
Where it's you and me layin' on our backs (Yeah)

[Chorus: LA Priest & Amine]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

[Outro: Rickey Thompson]
And that's all folks!
*Laughter* Ta-ta now



[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I cut my hair and bump my head and fell on top
And run on sins, and front on friends
If we don't win then pay your Tithes and mend your fence
And we alright, the Kaio Ken and big old rims
And LA hoes, if that ain't wrong, if I ain't gone
I ain't home, I ain't them, I ain't them
No more ends and no more trends
And photo tint and photo lens, notice this
Pour this shit, bonafide, woe is me
Bowl of grits, naked pimp, beamin' up, clean as fuck
Other side chill for niggas, makin' life look clear for niggas
Hill for niggas, tip top cliff for niggas, this the vision side to side
So give the nigga, if we honest you gon' miss a nigga
Twisted with 'em, this the isms
See your bitch might kiss a nigga, which nigga? Get specific
Big ass pot, wrist is glistened, your list is shit
And your, if it isn't, this cost some titties and scar your face
The wrong of wrongs has caught a case
Other niggas they Mobb like Carter say from far away
All my niggas like "Calm down"
Lovin' life above a reason, just can't find it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, and Bobby Whitney
Get too tired to write and died in prison
Felt like Rob tonight, lost my god tonight?

[Hook: Zacari]
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you can't walk away?
Depending on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
I kick back with kick though
Maybe if I could live hundred years that be real?
Pay me if I'mma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy, my other show went to my mom 'n' 'em
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
I bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
I'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay, I'm the best rapper since twenty five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
To all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...

[Hook: Zacari]
...so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Oh you got two Xannies, oh, just don't forget me
Love me for the moment (all in the air now) hug me like a sibling
Weed ain't that important, vice cops in the kitchen
Grew with Apollonia (all in the air now) Rob was makin' chicken
Beat me down, you beat me down, reorganize my face
Now when I go home, I don't know what my fam gon' say
Zay, say it ain't love cause you bought flowers yesterday
Thoughts was always cheap, cheap, cheap
But now let's talk 'bout me, me, me
Lately I been comin', this ain't goin' how I wanted
When I pull up at your window, bitch come out, you hear that beep, beep, beep
Faithful as your EBT, closer than you momma kin
Anger when you rang about my dog but I'm gon' call again
Freak me out, keep me out, why they always leave me out
Niggas that been hatin'  just can't wait to have my CD now
Don't we look like CP and Nirvana on that keep me pound
Please be down, I been more than late...

[Hook: Zacari]
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
All in the air now

[Outro: Dave Free]
Okay, I'mma tell you this story, man...A few years ago, I gave my pops, uh, Cilvia, Cilvia Demo and my pops said, uh...he listened to it for about a week, came back to me, said, uh...said, "Dang, boy, why...Zay talkin' 'bout he gon' run up in somebody house? He...he...he talkin' 'bout you?"



[Intro]
Beat tight as fuck. Turn up! Turn the light off, Des, turn it down. Aye, you roll up? You’ll roll up for the boys? For the Squad? Nah, that’s Ty job right now. Aye, check me out

[Chorus]
If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain’t nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

[Verse 1]
I think I do this shit for real dawg
Hey, I ain't no motherfuckin' maybe
I'm for motherfuckin' real dawg
Hey mama, mama
I got some dollars for your bills, though (Bills though)
Hey, now I'm the hit and I'm the topic
All that matters I'm Jaleel dog,  hey
You know I think the sunshine
Should feel how I feel, how I feel like yeah
I think at night time, the moon should call my phone
Hit my line, I'm here for you
And Eastside shame on us
Rain come on now
I figured the mood
I figure, I figure

[Chorus]
When I pay my bills I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

[Verse 2]
I got a dollar and a stop in Kansas
Toto to do or do not, do not forget me
I been wylin' Santa, pop and rock 'em
Lord forgive 'em for the talcum powder
Alright now stretch it, bless it
Bless it my brother and his record
On the record, for the record
Hey, and play it back 'cause they respect us
Alright now I got the moon and the stars below my feet
So low I speak
So I don't wake them, praise the Lord, the God in me
Who made me spoiled with rotten teeth
So I perform the prophecy
And on the norm the plot could be
To be expressing who we are and addressin' who they aren't
And doin' what they can't...and want

[Chorus]
If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey



[Produced by Chris Calor and The Antydote]

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, is reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, roll model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't meant to shine, beat me up in a rhyme spot
No crying 'til I'm in pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil staying where Fay at
Bitch don't run your mouth we don't play that
Mama taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried about this cheddar
Them niggas just skydiving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't trying to be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and not kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick

[Bridge]
I'm praying for some good rappers and a Fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows cornrows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

[Chorus]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Everything takes time
Is you selling or you buying nigga? Get rich or die trying
Yay yay on the stove, I had the choppers in the Cutlass
Just a young nigga tryna get some hundreds
I had a little bucket, yeah, I rode it like a benz
Yeah I spent my little ends on that Butlass
Tell me who you trust
Look I got my faith in God 'cause these clown ass niggas all bustas
These niggas not Jesus, they ain't gonna die for you
And only time will tell what's gon' lie for you
It's funny right what a couple lies will do
But seeing is believing what defines the truth
I keep shooters on the wing when I'm riding through
And if niggas out of bounds they gon probably shoot
Cause killing is the hobby
Eastside niggas, yeah, we known for catching bodies
I used to have a deuce five riding on the trolly
On my way to school like dare, nigga try me
Look, cause where I'm from I'm a blood on an island
Surrounded by blue water, sharks all around me
Pigs on my ass, hoes tryna drown me
Niggas know I'm up so these haters wanna down me
Niggas know I'm king but they don't wanna crown me
It's okay, I ain't 'bout to whine about it
Look, a real nigga for real nigga, now check it
I'm still here I'm still counting my blessings
With no chains on, with no rings on
Watching these fake rappers, getting my aim on
Pop a shot, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
And watch 'em fall like confetti, fuck 'em all (fuck 'em all)
It's just me and my niggas taking over the game
And since I conquered this craft, nothing will be the same

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Not a dollar on me, this home invasion a payday
Two-time felon they jerking me on my pay rate
Slaving all these hours but couldn't shake that my rent late
Making eight an hour I'm leaning towards my AK
Moms thinks I'm vicious, don't want me 'round the kitchen
My living room, bathroom, my bedroom was evicted
Missing from your homeroom my good grades was cripping
Before I even learned division, nigga I learnt the mission
See I'm from where fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the lotto
And I'm from where fiends fix that fix and not a  bottle
And that little nigga that missed that bottle gon' catch a hollow
Or maybe even throw him pyro, pyro
See this set don't make too many niggas rich that I know
You either gang bang, sell dope or bet on the four
See money on the ground, my eyes glued to the floor
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and go
I feel stuck in my ways, a nigga just tryna get paid
I'm tired of answering questions why Oxymoron delayed
See I was thinking November, but January is sweet
It set my setbacks free, my habits won in my sleep
So January agree, get a taste of this gangsta
See I'm just tryna eat, with a freak of the week
I'm just tryna hit 'em and leave 'em, dog, they yours for the keep
But don't be kissing them broads, my sperm on their teeth
Last night was nothing, this morning I'm a hero
No belief in me, dawg, they said I'd mount to zero
Cocaine, cocaine, rock, rock kilo
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find Nemo
Pull up to the block and they call me real nigga
See I can be a real nigga, but my daughter see me bigger
See a body full of love and yours full of liquor
But you'll always be my nigga, said you'll always be my nigga

[Chorus]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Now, everybody tellin' me a lie
Lordy, give me something for my soul
See, I don't wanna think of suicide
So please don't take the lock key off my door
See, I've been tired of fucking all these girls
And I've been tired of spending all my dough
And if I give my story to the world
I wonder if they'd book me for a show
See you can't handle pressure on your own
So why you carry boulder by yourself?
The story’s storyteller tell it wrong
And glorify the horror and the wealth
And Mama call me, tell me coming home
And I just need some guidance in my steps
I know I'm not the only one alone
I know I'm not the only one who felt

[Hook: SZA]
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Look now, I'm praying that I make it twenty-five
They be calling doctors for my health
And "no" is kinda hard to say to drugs
I been having problems with myself
And I been asking questions, where the love?
And they don't give me answers, just a check
And they don't know my issues as a child
Cause I was busy cutting on myself
And hanging from the playground wasn't wrong
Until you got a rope around your neck
And I been losing more than just my mind
Gathering what's left of self-respect
And Daddy, why you call me while you're drunk?
And why you never love me when I need it?
And I don't wanna be like you no more
And I been trying to cope, I'm getting weeded

[Hook: SZA]
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Look hey I smoke too much:
The problems of a twenty-something
I drink too often, there's liquor pouring from the faucet
You would assume by following the tunes
That I'm doomed to die young, addicted to dry plum
These bitches ain't shit
And pussy is my greatest vice
I love smoking weed, I hate advice
I know some niggas that talk good
The wise men from a long line of bitch-made and brides-men
You never had nothing but fucking dreams
You just caught up in the hype
The fashion and so it seems, the limelight
I know that I rhyme tight
No need for your two cents and burning your blueprints
These people think I really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
Just need a moment of silence, just close your fuckin' mouth
Infatuated with violence, gun in my fuckin' mouth
So you don't even know that I'm serious
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Like you got punchlines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
And you got punch lines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
Yeah, and I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
And they souls was never in it, like
And I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
They souls was never in it, like...

[Verse]
Mama I knew I was 'bout it
Way before venue was crowded
Way before Kevin pulled up with that Reverend
I told him to level, go fuck on the feelings
Don't nut on her face
Trust me I feel like the man
Trust me I feel like the Wop, rock
You can depend on the stock, watch
Bitch I got ten in the pot, crock
All of my limits could die, all of y'all niggas
All of my limits could die
Look at you timid as fuck and you holding me up
And I'm trying to be Nicki Minaj
Rich as a bitch in the drop
Rich as a bitch, rich as my bitch on the side
Hoe I got more than you know, ho I got...
Look, watch, spill out your soul in the closet
Don't question your passion
We flipped that reefer 'cause we couldn't be ashing
They got me so high that I look like I'm passing
Bitch, don't you know who you asking?
Bitch, have you tutored the pastor?
I know the root and the master
I know the coupe was a casket
I had that bitch looking like all the shit that I’m writing
That shit was so good that I passed it
Bust that shit straight out the plastic
Bitch, I ain’t good, bitch, I’m crafty
I wanna piss on a rapper
I just got hookers and pampers
Niggas line up when I practice
I’m not a savage, I don’t do shit just to do it
This going precise as we planned it
I'm just a bandit, plus I'm as sharp as a tack
Or a guillotine right at your family
Keep it so candid, knock ya like sheets and some candy
You down for this shit? Are you Brandy?
Find a mechanic, tell 'em I pay 'em in fabric
3500 in traffic

[Hook]
Nigga I'm savvy
I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm savvy, wait (hey)
Wait, look, nigga I'm savvy
I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm savvy, I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm swagging
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Nigga what's happening?
Niggas want piss on your grave
Bitch I might piss on your family
Nigga what's happening?
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Bitch I might shoot at your
Nigga what's happening?
I look more Cuban than Maverick
The metal, the tube or the handle
Nigga I'm savvy

[Outro]
Back-back, to the back-back
To the frozens and the BB's
Way before ya, way before ya
Thought I told ya, it's a lot on the line
These hoes, want a lot on the line
These hoes, ain't no bible of mine
Back-back, to the back-back
To the frozens and the BB's
If sixteen ain't enough
I could swing in twenty-five
I could tell ya how to go
I could tell you where to ride
I could tell you where the
If sixteen ain't enough

[Verse 1]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, it's reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, role model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
Fine as the shine, beam me up, and I’m riding Spock
No crying 'til I'm in a pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil', staying well fed
Bitch don't run your mouth, we don't play that
Momma taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried 'bout this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't tryna be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and I'll kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick!

[Bridge]
I'm praying for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Outro]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, don't make a sound
I came, I saw, I conquered, what you do now?
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do?
Don't make a sound, bitch

I mean, I mean I been thinkin, nah
Alright Rob this the one, last one, check me out

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
So don't call me a nigga, unless you call me "my nigga"
I'm a king, O.E. be slipping, falling from my chalice
Don't mind the bumpers that was missing from my carriage
It's poorly tinted, but my women not embarrassed
I came to bury you average, you feel slighted
It's like she know that I got it, it feel like it
I real life it, I spill vices
You will like it, I promise it's trill vomit, I'm honest
Nigga ain't no getting money on that conscious shit
I'mma just load my gat on some survival shit
And when I hear they got a drought on it
I take a month out of rap and I hustle 'til I'm out of it
I got that coke flow, that heat rock
I got that old school, huddle 'til the beat box
Baby, I'm just digging in your gushy for the sweet spot
I'mma beat that, 'til that mothafuckin' beat drop

[Hook: SZA]
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros

My bitches, my strippers, my hoes
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Hope they don't kill you cause you black today
They only feel you when you pass away
The eulogy be so moving, we live the scenes of those movies
Conflict in school or dope moving, it's so youthful
But if you die today, I hope you findin' some relief
In what a great escape, we still dodging from polices
When we make a plate, they lying, searching in my bucket
With the straightest face, it could be eighty eight
Sometimes I wonder why we killers, why they killing us
I think we only wear a grill because they grilling us
Or how they feeling us, gotta look real and tough
Gotta keep your hands in the cart, know you stealing stuff
Came a long way from a boat and an auction
Now we got names and a vote, then a coffin
Ain't shit change but the coast we adopted
Little black children you can call me that nigga, nigga

[Hook: SZA]
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes
I got love for my nigga

Now can we fall in love while Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
Fall in love, through the night
And I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living, do or die
Type of way, do or die
And when they see our age, they say we're young
I'll let you push me to the side
Push me to the side
At least we fell in love with something greater than debating suicide
At least we fell in love

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?

[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Man, I'm just writing shit don't get mad when we're tryna rap
Listen me in this motherfucker..
Yeah

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I'm just one dirty motherfucker, hurt myself way more than you
This too much out here for the cup, I put that codeine in my soup
Used to spit in granny face, I'm supposed to show you love
I don't need no picket line and I don't need no fuckin' hug
You just rappin' just because, with your napkin full of drugs
Too exclusive in the back, should we sneak 'em in the club?
Who is that nigga if I ain't that nigga?
It ain't that poppin' if I ain't with Robert
Gotta consider my liver, my nigga
Gotta get rid of my kidney, my nigga
That was the only thing holding me back
None of these niggas ain't tellin' me shit
Lately I only been bumpin' that Yachty
All this Burberry on top of my body
I knew Lil Sunny would get me that 'Rari
Pullin' up tryna tell me the truth
I hit you back like, lil nigga, revise it
Look what I got, bitch, it's Tity and Dolla
Tell 'em lay back and just check out the power

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want
Just wanna be, like one of them
But now I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away
I know that bitches gon' be with it but I love them hoes
Just call before 'fore you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call it before you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you come
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you
Yeah call before you come, bitch!

[Verse 2: Hugh Augustine]
I be on my own shit, what's the motion?
Condoms, weed, and lotion, wavy like the ocean
I got no emotions, dolo in the function
You ain't in my section, you can't tell me nothin'
She just wanna sip on the real pink soda
Ride with a big billed .40
Slide through the hood, I know it's all good
I ain't from the set but I still got soldiers
Seven when I roll the dice, Henny straight, hold the ice
Lately I don't take advice, claimin' we don't live for twice
Send you to a poltergeist, treat the beat like I planned a heist

[Bridge: Hugh Augustine]
I know bitches just wanna be hoes
No hoe just wanna love me
Know she wanna get cuddly, sip the bubbly
With an OG smokin' OG
I know bitches just wanna be hoes
No hoe just wanna love me

Gang sicker than ebola, bitch
Know when to roll up when I load my .45
Sheesh, fine lines I cross between
Pimp shit and try to enjoy this life
Yeah bitch I know what it's like
You get whatever you wish long as your coin is right, right
Wake up to the real tamale
So ill might kill somebody just for GP
Be me with a white bitch
Waitin' around the corner in a Mustang GT
I ain't talkin' bout much
Nothin' but fuckin' and countin' a few bucks
I'm all that shit you talk
My crystal ball show your future when I cruise up, now listen
All I want is gravy for my steak, bitch
I'm gon' grind for this weight
That means I gots no time to wait, bitch
'Fore you fry my chicken, scrape that resin off that plate, bitch
No cut, no chase, I'ma do my place so cut that fake shit

Told my girl, "Man, I hit your phone, say where your head be at?"
We ain't speak in four or five months, so I'm nervous now
You said that you heard my last shit, so I know you're mad now
Oh man, still that nigga
Uptown with the hittas
Pop a nigga like we pop a wheely
Niggas goin' crazy in the city
If we do it, show up in the city
Just did that instead of rockin' with me
Always keep it so one thousand with ya
Always down to run a mountain for ya

[Hook: Jessy Rose]
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Said baby, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby, I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you

[Verse 2: Goldlink]
Roll up, rockin', get to poppin' with ya
Ain't nobody get to fightin' with ya
Ain't nobody get to pipe and hit ya
And if I'm that nigga, can't nobody get ya
Wild nigga from the wild side
DC nigga so I'm real dry
Yeah, yeah, got the mob ties from the east side to the west side
Super fake with the hoes now
Countin' money with the bros now
G starrin' from a Benz
Lick, lick, lick, lick with the scope now
Skrrt, skrrt in the coupe (huh)
Ask a shawty what it do? (huh)
I ain't really mean to fall in love with a hood bitch, but it's you

[Bridge: Jessy Rose]
I will be right by your shoulder, babe
And when the weather gets colder
Know that I'm right there (know that I'm right)
Said you should know that I'm right there (ahhh)
I will be right by your shoulder, babe
And when the weather gets colder
Know that I'm right there (know that I'm right)
Said you should know that I'm right there (ahhh)

[Hook: Jessy Rose]
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Said baby I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you

[Chorus]
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no *scratch* givin' tips
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips

Run through your, run through your clique

[Break (Tagalog)]
Nakakainis talaga siya, pero iniisip ko na mahal na mahal ko siya. Parang palaging kami magkasama, pero may tiwala na ako sa kanya. Lahat ng ibang tao na dumating bago sa kanya, wala na sila. Di na bale

[Verse 1]
I learned a lot in such a short amount of time
Everything that's fuckin' fine and gold, it ain't mine
Met you when I was like maybe fifteen years old and you
Just act a lil' older plus I heard you came from Arizona
And I was new so I was poppin' up at house parties
Ridin' fuckin' dirty wit' the older niggas ridin' for me
And they just taught me how the game work
I said fuck it, I'ma push the rock and buy a lot of dumb shit
But fuck it, was my initial thought when I had met you
I was sittin' in the bleachers when your girls approached me
And they threw away your number like you wasn't taken or something
I told 'em, "Baby, I'm nothing, see why you wanna choose me?"
They giggled and walked away, I prayed to God
It felt so right, I never knew the devil fuckin' looked this nice
So if you ever tried to blame it on me
I'ma blame it on my dick, know I'm sick, yeah I'd run through ya

[Break (Tagalog)]

I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no, I ain't for no
Run through your, run through your clique

[Verse 2]
Nineteen, I got a newer meaning
Rocked monk beads, God chains, searchin' for a deeper meaning
Still burnin' women, what a deadly contradiction
Nigga toyin' with the physical and spiritual
Lookin' back at what my life, man, what a fuckin' trip
I could've loved this bitch and lost myself so I can please the bitch
And never please a bitch is what I learned and then I went away from everything
I started searchin' for and well, uh
Mo' bitches, mo' money, mo' drugs
Found my niggas, started robbin', went west, start juggin'
Picked rappin', they chose, I blew, my crew
Got big, split wigs, still rob, mo' rap
We battle, we fight, we won, big one
No pun, all skill, no bitch in my clique
Young nigga, no whip, my niggas legit
And I pray for my clan and my squad while I run through your (clique)

[Bridge]
Run through your clique
Run through, run through your clique
Run through your clique
Run through

[Chorus]
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip

Run through your, run through your clique

Had to go to LA for the winter
Had to vibe out, Just caught a charge had to hideout
Real nigga talk slick to ya
Told ya bring your girlfriend, tell her bring her friends too
Tell me Hollywood kinda weird
You don't really like it but you gotta play the biz
Yeah met ya last June
By next June we were all in love and wanna fuck now
Fell in love at the wrong time
Spent a night at my high rise
Or hit me late on my hotline
Telling me you miss my homies and your mama cry
Late night you're my boo thing, yeah
Your mercedes with the blue tint, yeah
All praise to the most high leader
Dipped off in the Hills wouldn’t wanna be ya

[Hook: April George]
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Went back to the homeland
Had to tell the niggas what I did in your hometown
Everybody know we probably woulda made it last
But there you go, started tripping never hit me back
Real nigga went back to the pimping
Started getting groovy with the women I was hitting
Got a gold chain and a nose ring
And a new watch, no tick but I always do time, yeah
Black boy with a black fade, yeah
Got mad when you did things
You was fucking and you did dirt too
We was talking but you never hear my phone boo
Moved up and I feel good shit
Roll palm trees and I made a hit for ya
Billboards around the city with your face on it
But they never ever really know bout what you been through
Stay asking where the hoes at, huh?
Why your homies gotta go there, huh?
I ain't trip when I see you I would dance at a show back in Feb
But you trip and we don't talk much
Girl you got me fucked up
Real nigga gotta get it when he fucked up
Fake niggas like a new man
Just a little side joint
Always been a side joint
Alright joint

[Hook: April George & GoldLink]
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more
Girl you're gone now

[Intro]
(Song fading out)
So you just heard "Dance On Me" by GoldLink here on Soulection Radio. I have an exclusive featuring Masego, called Late Night
Keep it locked

[Verse 1: Masego]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I admit it, I admit it
Yeah, you're not the only woman in my phone, yeah
I be up late chattin', interactin', straight mackin'
With all these other people, I'm sorry

[Hook: Masego]
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Got me askin' for 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Baby I don't know what to do, for me, for more
Late night life
Late night life
Late night life
Late night life

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
I admit it, I admit it
You're not the only woman in my phone
I'll be up late chattin', interacting
Wit' all bad bitches and these other people
Oh, I'm sorry
Drivin' in Oakland girl
Forgot the night before
Stayed at the Westin Inn
Looked in those tempting eyes
And you're all on my mind
Confident in you skin
Me, my boys and your friends
Yeah we had a good time
I hope to see you

[Hook: Masego]
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Got me askin' for 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Baby I don't know what to do, for me, for more

[Outro]
When I saw him, there was just something different. Like we always have so much fun. And they're crazy, like - him and his friends, they're so funny. It makes me so happy to be with them. Even when they say that he's the bad guy. You hear shit, but you find how to tune it out. Life's too short to ask questions. When you see Goldlink...just know that's all me, baby



[Intro: GoldLink]
Pretty woman, pretty girl with pretty thighs
Sorta black woman, had me feelin' like I'm 35
Get a girl, hit her with the phrase, like in my waist
Hit her both ways, as her main nigga and a sidekick

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
I met her in the summer, started with a kiss
And she fucked so good that I had to flood her wrist
Two days in and I wanna have her kid
Then she told me she belong to the city and her boy
Wear a wig and a cig just to smoke away her tears
And I wanna learn about her fears and touch her rear
I think I love her, can't nobody come before her
Ain't no one above her and I wrote this like a sucka singin'

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Uh, pretty woman, pretty girl and pretty thighs
Sorta black woman, had me feeling like I'm 35
Get it girl, hit her with the phrase, still stuck in my ways
Hit her both ways as her main nigga and a sidekick
Lil' rider, fuck me like a side chick
She down like a North Face with some 'posits
Bank credit card scammin' for deposits
And when I do, I do my thing, she never stop me
She love to love me, lovin' me is like a hobby
Lovin' the dough, and my nigga Joe, I told him hit the phone
She never let a nigga get too close
If I die, she'll probably marry me and love my ghost
So I had to work and get the Ghost
Had to work harder so the bitch'll see the Ghost
Oh, my baby ridin' in it and my baby ridin' tinted
And I only fuck with you because it got you in it, get it?

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge: GoldLink & Female]
I don't know why I care about you
Care about you
I don't know why I care about you
Care about you
I don't wanna motherfucking care about you
Care about you
I don't wanna motherfucking care about you
Care about you

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
I'ma die but you remember the guy
From sellin' grams the size of GameCube memory card
Yeah yeah, I got a problem with your ex and he know
That if he hit your phone again, I gotta shoot with the 4
'Fore I hit a nigga crazy, leavin' brains on the floor
That's the, "Yeah, keep it movin" like I'm hittin' a hoe
Anyway just know I love you more and more and it shows
And I promise, baby girl, I'll probably never let go

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Outro]
I just want you girl
Oh my, oh
Won't you be all mine?
Oh-ooh, babe
'Cause I need you girl
You, you, you, babe
I need you girl
Because I need you more
Yeah
When we go 'round
When we go 'round in circles
Until then
When we go 'round
When we go 'round in circles
Until then



[Verse 1: Goldlink]
I still see ya, I still see ya
Doin' everything that we said we gon' do
Girl I still see ya, I still see ya
Puttin' all my pride and my girls to the side
'Cause I still see ya, I still see ya
Smokin' all my weed, bend the corners in the streets
I can still see ya, I still see ya
You wanna be me, I wanna eat ya
I wanna meet your ex, so I can beat him
And have a daughter, and be a teacher
And never follow, and be a leader
And baby girl, I still see ya
I got a light-skinned bitch who look like Beige Loaf
And she fight and fuck me in the same clothes
But when I put that daddy, baby daddy, papa stroke
She curl her toes and close her eyes
I finish up, she adios
I still call ya
Whichever way you want it, baby girl, it's on ya
I got the money, you got the problems
So I can solve it, but I still need ya
I still see ya
And that's okay, baby, all my niggas G'd up
Yeah most of 'em either C's or B's, yeah
That's right, hell yeah
Anyways we can get to movin' on the dance floor
No choice

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
I wanna be more than homies
I wanna feel your body on me
I wanna be your lover, your lady
Just wanna be your baby
Your one and only
I wanna be more than homies
I wanna feel your body on me
I wanna be your lover, your lady
Just wanna be your baby
Your one and only

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
Shake, shake, shake
Shake the nerves off
In the name of dancehall
Shake the nerves off
Come give it to me

[Verse 2: Goldlink]
You don't like religion, but you like this
You don't want kids, but you want this
I ain't never had the juice like this
Backstroke up in the pussy like... like...
Listen, I'm a real nigga, love a go-getter
See ain't no bitch around the city fuckin' with ya
Louis V, shades Gucci with the dress gown
Hit the boulevard, baby, take a picture
Everybody in your pussy right now
Everybody think they got you right now
But ain't nobody hip that you don't please 'em
'Cause you're always steady teasin'
'Cause your feelings anesthesia, word to Keisha, uh
Got niggas in your iPhone, real
Real nigga, you the right one, yeah
Maryland girl with an accent, uh
That's everybody's weakness, uh
Bad little, bad, bad bitch, uh
You above the average, uh
Your favorite band was Backyard, mmm
Baby girl you is vicious, ah
You the one, you the one now, ah
After daughter, want a son now
Sundress to a wedding gown, sheesh
Got me talkin' like Gleesh now, woah
UMD in the fall now
You the only one we talk about, uh
Year later, still l think about it
Heartbreaking, man I dream about it, that real

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
I wanna be more than homies
I wanna feel your body on me
I wanna be your lover, your lady
Just wanna be your baby
Your one and only
I wanna be more than homies
I wanna feel your body on me
I wanna be your lover, your lady
Just wanna be your baby
Your one and only

Yo! Hey what up, George called. Apparently some kids got in to the shop. Get the fuck up and go over there and clear it up. Oh babe, niggas

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance on me, dance on me
Bring it back baby, just dance on me
Brought your heels to the party
Ain't here to hurt nobody
I'm a old soul and I rock gold
And I got scooped in the 'rari
But I'm a bad boy and you know
There's no boyfriends allowed to the party
Dick game vicious, demolition nigga with the bitches
Fake fat ass with extensions
God damn pimpin', any other nigga wanna hit this
He goin' have to pay for them titty tig ole' bitties
Yes Lord, can a young nigga hit that hoe?
Can a young nigga do somethin' better
But instead of always trappin' just to get that dough
Shit, it's cool, and you so fine
You so fine I eat behind, between those legs
In those jeans, take those off, now watch you spread
You so special and so pink, slightly hairy and don't stink

She got that

[Hook]
You know I want you baby doll

[Verse 2]
Mane, fuck wit' a nigga like me and shit

While I please his bitch, while I cock the 5th
And I take her ass out, go to Saks and Fifth
And I hit my lil nigga, so I get it for the low
And my youngest lil nigga, gettin' back up in the hole
Back to gettin' money and bein' an asshole
Thinkin' silly motherfuckas' ain't goin' pay me for my dough
Mane fuck that shit
Rush that nigga, while I rush that bitch too
I don't give a fuck about you
But I do what I see and I do wanna feel what that mouth do

And I might go and just taze me a nigga
Okay my nigga? So pay me nigga

Alright na na na na
Ah na na na na na

Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love

[Verse 1: Goldlink]
Baby girl, don’t don't ask about me
I’m just bad girl, I’m bad for everybody
Babygirl, don't tell your friends
That nigga with a neck tat, respect that
Old bitch, she ain't like that, she left that
Dropped one tape, two tape
Brand new can't even get a hold off a nigga
Pose with a man that's like that
Smooth nigga does no-no rappin'
New girl, 5 stars​, she an actress
She's so used to the light, so plastic
By the lake, LA like Magic
Spit rappin', no plan, just glasses, a bad habit
Then I tell them, baby—

[Hook: Goldlink]
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love

[Verse 2: Ciscero]
Yeah girl you know I’m too legit
Hittin' on my mans that I be coolin' with, hooligan
Girl I told you I ain't one you foolin' with
Not communicatin' but I get that from my mama
It's a jungle of gorillas—why you fuck with anacondas?
I'm a Zulu Nation rapper, get the hammer like your honor
Keep it movin' for my partners, ain't no hoovin' in mi casa
Ain't no hoopin', she just dancing at the juices but not Fanta
Got the juice and then I lost it
I put two in my deposit last week
But I made that cat weak, black sheep, ay
Do not fall in love with that nigga wrap sheet, ay
You know I'm just out here really tryna pass me, ay
Young Ciscero keep that ass nasty, ay
I don't know bout that but I do love
This right here, this that group love
Hey, so what happened to love?
This that, "Time to shoot, get your new girl"

[Hook: Goldlink]
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love



[Intro]
Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell Momma imma quit but I love cash

[Verse 1]
I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends (ayy)
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin jugs
Used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, Your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened
Got a new bitch from China, she wearing designer
I'm lacing her in the new fashion (ayy)

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep a Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Told Momma imma quit but I love cash

[Verse 2]
I've been all around the fucking globe
Baby what ya know
Motherfucker better tuck and roll
Got places to go
And niggas missed the last flight
Livin' in the fast life
Momma said you never act right (goddamn)
Guess I'm a bad guy
But I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, and my benjiz blue
Shit is fucked up when they envy you
'Member niggas got killed over Penny shoes
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty of you
It was all a dream, reminiscing of a smaller thing
Grandma cooking like Paula Deen
It ain't all it seems, grew up with the starving teens
And growing plants, still watering

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil hoe, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash, hit the route fast
I'ma get that lil nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans (ayy)
Hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep a Tommy on me like a Rugrat (ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Told Momma imma quit but I love cash

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to 10



[Intro]
Damn, Mizzy Mauri got beats

[Verse]
Uh, old niggas and new niggas, now what's the difference?
All in the same boat in a stuck position
So when an old nigga talkin' I don't fuckin' listen
They don't know every day we make tough decisions
It seems though we is at a generational gap
Which bring conversation and a statement in fact
We can agree none of us is 'posed to make it in rap
I understand both sides, let me break it in half
Let's take it back when hip hop originated
And old niggas said it was wack, they couldn't take it
And called it a little trend, said it wouldn't last
Now it's the number one genre as the time passed
Young niggas won't listen and we know it
But old niggas always talk and never show it
You gotta practice what you preach and the classes that you teach
We'll eventually listen, my mind mentally prison, uh
Lately all my idols they been failin' me
Catchin' sexual assaults and some felonies
Then you want me to listen what you tellin' me
And wanna hate when we sing our little melodies
And other idols they be broke, get your funds in order
And Kanye West is a Trump supporter
Then we got R. Kelly and Bill Cosby
Who still probably got lil girls in the Hills lobby
And these supposed to be our heros? negro please
Old niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees
Only man I can trust is G-O-D
Not to mention Mos Def and Talib Kweli
Now I get it, y'all think new niggas really suck
And white kids fuckin' love it, lil silly ducks
But I know it's a lot of bullshit goin' on, I understand
But please don't complain without a plan
Ironically I wrote this whole song off a xan, nah I'm playin'
I'm just tryna be a fuckin' man
We see you old niggas as a lot of clowns
Not to mention our father figures was not around
So we all on tours and we hoppin' towns
We just need to sit down and find common ground
And it's soon to come, soon to come
Hip hop need balance like the moon and sun
It feel good when I wear Christian Louboutins
So I gotta drop music to accrue some funds
And I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest
But feedin' our families, lowering the crime yet
You want us to be separate and make a contest
Rappin' to stay up out the streets, shouldn't mind that
Stayin' out of prison and we sayin' fuck the system man
Rappin' is an outlet to go and get our dividends
Rather than out robbin' niggas, sellin' Ritalin
Old niggas bitter, y'all should love it when a nigga win
'Cause we came from the same struggle like Diddy and Dame Russell
Was teachin' and gained hustle, got rich, remained subtle
See I listen, see I listen
But Lil Dae-Dae water whippin' in the kitchen
Ready to flip a pack and bring it back, no submission
Gotta just go attack Lil Pump when you're dissin'
I understand both sides of the Ziploc
Y'all old niggas' time is comin' nigga, tick tock
I'ma still wear all my Gucci flip-flops
And the fuckin' diamond chain with the big rocks
And I'll be the greatest ever nigga, just watch
Cardi B got rich from Love & Hip Hop, haha



[Intro]
Maddox on the beat
MWA Music
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position

[Verse 1]
The game is over, my pain is over
You a lame, a joker
You can't catch me plus my flow is nasty
And my name is vulgar
YBN, go and try again, we be the flyest friends
I do my thing
Plus I pull some strings just like a violin
Let me tell you 'bout my life and my troubled past
Momma's car got stolen, took the shuttle pass
Re-up from three bucks copped the duffle bag
Please bruh, off these nuts, go and rush some cash
And now we winning again
My brothers spending a band
My niggas posted on the block, damn I be sinning with friends
I'm chasing twenties, Benjamins, and breaking barriers too
My family rich for generations, I might marry a Jew
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position, uh

[Verse 2]
My lifestyle too wild, I know
Everything change with a new high low
Fifty bands, what I cashed in, my show
I got that gas, this that hydro
I'm too great, I don't have rivals
Niggas be telling speed dial 5-0
Cause these niggas be fake
I'm a winner these days
Motherfuckers be sweet, with a hint of cheesecake
Syrup spilling, coughin' penicillin
Heads turning walking in the building
Ledge burnin' often I'm a villain
Was deserted, brought up by some real ones
Had to catch it reckless, was a daily
Momma calling checking on her baby
Took a trip to Texas going crazy
Eating beats for breakfast, I'm elated
I was stressing, blessings on the way
Dropped out, no testing me today
Murder tracks, I bet I beat the case
Redbone, she built like LisaRaye
Stack my chips I bought my Frito Lay
I don't listen what these people say
Fuck a Honda, niggas need a Wraith
Damn the whole team eating great

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster, ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position (ah)



[Intro]
Wooh!
Alright, alright
Now listen, listen loud and clear, you dig?
This is uh, this is history
For real nigga
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo
Now check me out, listen

[Verse 1]
Why everybody change on me?
While I remain the same, that's why I'm bringing Major Payne
Like mothafuckin' Damon Wayans
And now you chickens is toast, this ain't Raising Cane's
It's clear we wasn't raised the same, rappers lame with fame
I'm known to kill a wack rapper like a bad hobby
I smash hotties and stash bodies, then cop lil' boats
Like that's Yachty, and that's probably
Why I'm so fly that I crash lobbies and after it slap thotties
I'm a rap fanatic who rap fantastic without the platinum status
Why I'm blastin' the maddest 'cause most of these cats is average (uh)
I swear to God that I never lie to avoid a fact
A terrible hair stylist, I'm destroying tracks
I don’t bust guns but my niggas deploy the strap
Then bring out a fucking .45 like Michael Jordan's back
I wanna give these niggas hell if heaven was grant
The best thing from PG since Kevin Durant

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is, yeah
Oh yeah, YBN shit
Don't doubt my name, I said, I tell 'em what my name
Nigga better know the name, yeah, YBN shit
Better know, my name is (yuh)

[Verse 2]
See, a nigga was skippin' class, damn I rather attempt the raps
Said fuck it I'm missing that, when I blow go tick for tack
I'm a boss on my Diddy shit, my flow is too hideous
Dropped out of school, senior year, a true idiot
You see, I wear designer bags, I don't carry minor cash
I'm trying to find the stack, big as Blac Chyna's ass
Oh you wack rhymers, trash climbers, that's kinda sad
In the pathfinder, but my path couldn't find my dad
Now my soul dented, pulled up in a Ghost tinted
In a drive-by, where niggas shooting shit like Cole Bennett
You ho's finished, in this rap shit a cold menace
But I'm flowin' gold liquid, damn I'm so vicious
Uh, my name is Cordae, but don't forget the YBN
I used to get high with friends off grandmama's vicodins
And mix it with a percocet, damn that really worked a sweat
My verse is just perfect, yeah, fuck it go and search the net

[Hook]
Hah, my name is, my name is
Nigga's be the lamest, YBN shit
My name, you nigga's know his name
The nigga's flow is lame, nigga, hah

[Outro]
Man, these niggas whack as fuck in this music shit, bro, like what the fuck
You niggas suck like shit bro, like damn you niggas fucking suck
Man



[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Told my bro roll a wood
We gon' spark that shit up
It's gon' take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past
My brothers they passed
Pray my life it won't fade away
Spend a few bands on my drip
Look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist
It cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Niggas gon' hate cause we up now
We throw a party, that shit gon' get shut down
The people that's talking that mess gon' be broke
So why do they still take the bus 'round
I had to spice up my lifestyle
Tell my momma that I gotta shine now
My brother got booked for a minute
So I had to go and make grand mama real proud
So I'm stuck in these streets
Even with all this money I still keep my heat
I'll leave you dead in yo' seat
If you thinkin' 'bout killin' then takin' from me
Body bag, whippin' a four door
Man these niggas they really don't want smoke
Never switch on my bros that's the bro code
For all of my brothers go loco

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Told my bro roll a wood
We gon' spark that shit up
It's gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past
My brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip
Look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist
It cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit
Told my bro roll a wood
We gon' spark that shit up
It's gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past
My brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip
Look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist
It cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit

[Verse 2: YBN Cordae]
Only the real can stand with us
Stressing, I'm smoking on cannabis
Just made a trip to Los Angeles
It's funny, man, I used to lay on the bus
Enough now, this game is so crazy
It made me not know who to trust now
And we shinin', Nahmir copped the bustdown
Then we grinding we not letting up now
'Cause we know that shit meant to be
And this stress got me fucking up mentally
And just like my lil' brother
I witnessed my mother she crying
He gone for a century
And that fucked up my mental
Feeling revengeful
Nigga just check my credentials
Shit that I been through
Damn, it made my life so eventful
Shit, it's a cycle like menstrual

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Told my bro roll a wood
We gon' spark that shit up
It gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past
My brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip
Look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist
It cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit
Told my bro roll a wood
We gon' spark that shit up
It gone take all the pain away
I'm stuck in my past
My brothers they pass
Pray to my life it won't fade away
Spent a few bands on my drip
Look at my kicks
Spanish bitch all on my dick
Rollie, gon' ice out my wrist
It cost a brick
Baby, this not counterfeit



[Intro]
Eee-oooh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Uh uh
They said check at the tank
Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that's ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

[Verse]
Seen the red and blue lights, and I got pulled over
Redneck-ass cop asked me was I sober
I said hell nah nigga, stupid question to ask
I got a half pound of weed in the messenger bag
But I couldn’t tell ‘em that, I was wantin' to laugh
That's the number one rule, don’t be flauntin' your pack
And stop asking all these questions, now I'm tauntin' yo ass
And, if you want to search my car, you need a warrant for that
As soon as I said that stupid shit, my gun had slip into his grip
My nigga, I plead the fifth, I don't mean to diss man, but I gotta dip
He said "what in tarnation," hit the gas, I'm car racing
Plus I'm high in the sky, gas got me stargazin'
So here's a little advice, my sugar n’ spice, and you can get nice
Free my nigga T-Mac, that shit is so whack, they tryna indict
I just paid off all my debt, I'm gettin' them checks, it's changin' my life
I need a little respect, just copped a Patek, just look at my ice
So he ran up, "put yo hands up", you in handcuffs
You done lost your mother fuckin' head like you got dandruff
Woman lie, a nigga lie, fuck the cell, that shit is dry
Why you pull me over doing 60 in a 55?
All y'all is suspects, you knew that homes
Five niggas in the car, and y'all got durags on
Plus y'all bumpin' all the really loud new rap songs
That's three fuckin' strikes, I wanna go back home
How the fuck my straps slip, I be grounded and tight
He said, "boys it look like y'all at the County tonight
And the canines comin', you can stop with the jokes
So while y'all in there tonight, don't be droppin' the soap"

[Bridge]
I know that you hate me, I know that you jealous
I know you crazy, hiding behind an umbrella
Man I know I'm a target, shit I know I’m a threat
And I know y'all tryna stop me, 'cause you know I'm up next, nigga

[Chorus]
I was cruising in a 6-4 with all of my hoes
Two niggas with a pistol that’s ready to go
New bitch named Crystal, steady to blow
My team way too official, with Chevys and Rolls

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to ten, hey!



[Intro, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
Yes, sir
It's the L.A. Leakers, man
That's right
Power 106, liftoff show
Justin Credible, Sourmilk
We've been invaded by the DMV, man
We had to stay, yeah
What's up man, what we doin'?
Oh, alright bet (ah)
Right into it, let's get right, this history shit
Remember this
Classic moments on liftoff with the L.A. Leakers

[Verse 1, Instrumental: Kendrick Lamar, "DUCKWORTH."]
(Okay, uh)
Why everybody always seem to give me half effort?
I guess I need more clout, I know I rap better
I gotta stack cheddar, apply max pressure
Ski mask, black sweater, the daily attire
It made me acquire effort, my lazy is fired
God damn, why the fuck do I feel so entitled?
Beef comin', I take the high road, my life spirals
I'm longevity chasing, you overnight viral
I fight rivals, and stand taller than five Eiffels
Used to trap in the tower, made a stack in an hour
Money, immaculate power, is what we all desire
I got a passion, raw as fire that can fan the flame
Fuck your company name, homie, your brand is lame
I know the panic came, when I arrived
Soon controllin' the game, one of the flyest guys
Mama, please dry your eyes, you might decide
That your son a king
A crazy youngin' with a ton of dreams
I've seen a bunch of things that would make the average man commit suicide
But God know I had a plan
They sellin' souls, nigga, grab a stand
And for a bargain and a half a xan
You can buy the next mumble rapper, who
Had to humble after the label dropped him and robbed him (woah)
Game is the Gotham, my vice is sex
Dodgin' the Feds
My foot on the pedal,  my brake in the cycle
Got the heart of a rebel
You see, the way it gotta be
I stack a lot of cheese
And I keep my mob deep with rap prodigy
Never say my name, spit flame, who as hot as me?
Bro snatched a chain from a lame, diabolically
Imma be myself, with the wealth, no apologies
Never fuckin' switch it up, this rap shit ridiculous
They can't get rid of us, they tried it all
Every power has its rise and fall
Hear my phone, I'll decline the call
Please, do not disturb
Got a presidential flow, I'm Barack with words
New age, but they still puttin' rocks in herb
Pray to God, and I know that's gonna block the curse
'Cause I'm ill, nigga

[Interlude, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
Okay!
Hold up, hold up
Let's keep going, let's keep going
Keep goin? Yeah, what's next, nigga?
YBN Cordae is here
Yeah, I'm here to stay for a while
With the L.A. Leakers
Ooh! Ooh! Came with diversity
The Los Angeles Leakers
Let's switch it up a little bit, let's switch it up a little bit
Let's show them how we do this
Only real MCs can come on L.A. Leakers show
YBN Cordae (yeah)

[Verse 2, Instrumental: Lil Pump, “Esskeetit”]
I need a new Bugatti for the few who got me
Killin' beats is a ruthless hobby
You say your shooters caught me, never do what's floppy
Drop a kid like they do karate
I'll be the first, never lied in rap
I am a great, no denying that
I spit the high on the fire tracks
I cannot wait to blow up, when they say he acquire racks
I switch the style, and I make it easy
I changed my friend, because they was greedy
I'm makin' money, they pay to meet me
I give a fuck if a hater's scheming
I gotta grind and make every dollar
My money stronger than Larry Lobster
I work that magic, that Harry Potter
You niggas scared I'll bury ya, ayy

All my niggas rich, essketit (huh)
Just dropped a bag at Lenox, (huh)
New black whip, all tinted (huh)
New black whip, no renting (ayy)
Kill the freestyle on the Leakers, (huh)
Used to get head from the teachers, (ayy)
Smokin' that gas, no reefer (ayy)
Shit loud like the speakers (ayy)
Look, mama proud like Penny
Cracked the code, no DaVinci, (ayy)
Look, all my niggas wear Givenchy
Choker on me, no lynching (ayy)
Look, plenty ya bitches is fine
When ya cash out on designer (ayy)
Look, I need a bitch like Madonna
We'll take a trip out to China (ayy)

[Interlude, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
The Los Angeles Leakers
YBN Cordae
Let's keep it goin', man!
He flexin' on ya'll right now, MCs
Let's keep it goin', it's the L.A. Leakers, man!
Ain't no cell phones in sight, this real hip hop shit!
Woo, alright, alright
Let's get it, no
And he said no cell phones
We gotta end it with a bang, man!
YBN Cordae! History shit!
The Los Angeles Leakers
Damn, this shit drop hard!
It's classic, still slaps!

[Verse 3, Instrumental: Method Man & Redman, “Da Rockwilder”]
Alright
Check it out, listen (uh)
Blessed with a mind to help me shine to the throne
Didn't have any support, I had to grind on my own
And where I'm from, you get sprayed like the finest cologne
So if they shoot, you better duck, unless you dyin' alone
Consider yourself lucky if you listen to this
I told you I was the greatest, I predicted this shit
It's funny 'cause the same girl suckin' and lickin' the dick
Will go home and just start huggin' and kissin' the kids
And they always back for more, why they bother us?
I told you I'll call back, as soon as your father does
And when he doesn't, I know it build up a lot of lust
You do it all to make him proud, but that's still not enough
But fuck it, that's just the art of intimidation
See, fuck the judge and the litigation
And why these niggas hatin', 'cause I be fowin' like irrigation
They fear the nation
Had to rush and drop the tape, because the meal was patient
No pun intended, I'm at the doctors, I'm ill as fuck
I'm healin' up, they not feelin you, you not real enough
And to be honest dog, ya really suck
Find another hobby, ASAP
Please give it up
Please, nigga
Y'all niggas suck, like shit man
I ain't fuckin' with the rap niggas, yo

[Outro, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk, YBN Cordae]
You at the doctor, you ill?
Yeah! Hahaha!
YBN Cordae
See how we doin' it with the L.A. Leakers, man!
Classic material, L.A. Leakers' liftoff show
Justin Credible, Sourmilk
Power 106 is #1 for hip hop



[Intro: Malcolm X]
For instance, the average so-called Negro, he doesn't think that he can go into business and provide jobs for himself
And because of this, he thinks that he can only get a job from the White man
Or he can only get clothes from the White man, or he can only get food from the White man

[Verse 1]
Uh, we're takin' over the the racist motive, the hatred's older
The empire's retired, I'm just an ageist Yoda
Get some powder and baking soda, don't take the culture
They flip faster than racing motors. I'm made to blow up
If you don't understand now, then you will later
I'm from a place where they bust Glocks and steal paper
Nah, I'm talking assassination, they kill mayors
But can't overtake me because my skill's greater
Rap politician. Nominate my Congress
Never understood the Obama-hating nonsense
Black president. Dog, you hever had an option
'Cause, boy, I go monster way better than the Loch Ness
Let's get back to the subject: Blacks in the public
It seems like all other rap doesn't touch it
See, I tend to be the industry's redheaded stepchild
I've spoken too much. I'm surprised I'm not dead now

[Hook]
'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You see, these rap politicians are really something else
They start blowing all their funds moment they discover wealth
I mean, cop another belt. Shit, maybe even two
'Cause if you're not wearing designer, then crazy, you
When actuality, these guys are lazy goofs
They're the type to go dap a Piru in baby blue
Straight stupid. And these are the niggas who make music
Influence a generation, nobody relates to it
Nigga, now you see the problem? Do you see the trouble?
They're fucking up our brains for generational struggles
That black waitress works doubles just to get by
'Cause her son needs some Jordans, dog, just to get fly
I used to smoke an eighth a day, nigga, just to get high
And Nelqueisha didn't get the job that Jessica got
And when we get the 9 to 5s, we become satisfied
Amend the rap politics. Constitution ratified

[Hook]
'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah

[Verse 3]
It's time to overthrow this government. Military coup
'Cause if we don't soon, they'll still bury you
And the first plan of action: Man, y'all gotta stop the shooting
And no dickriding, that's technically prostitution
No backwards progression, always constant movement
Everything is in your hands, you just gotta grind to do it
But first things first needs diplomatic correction
'Cause rappers like me in the systematic oppression
Huey Newton of this rap shit. Y'all don't understand me
The same reason why Nas and Snoop still don't have a Grammy
Why you gotta blow thousands when you fly to Miami?
And why you can't be a rapper if you drive in a Camry?
They make it uncool to budget, want us blowing our cash
Then Uncle Sam makes us broke again when taking our tax
So depressed from this hex they supply in prescriptions
Modern day drug war, these rappers fighting addiction

[Hook]
'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah

[Outro: YBN Nahmir]
Listen, man, I ain't gonna lie, this shit is ass
This shit is not good
I need some coonery in my life
I'm tired of this black power, woke shit
A'ight? You gonna have to cut all that shit out, B
Seriously
I needs the crank
Yes, that's what I'm looking for, the word "crank"
I needs that
That is not this. This shit is ass. Turn it off
Not a good song
(Ass)
Trash
(Garbage)
Garbage
(Boo-boo, stank-stank)
Nigga
Motherfuckin'



[Intro]
We are anonymous
Yeah
Some- this...
This is one of them joints, man
Uh

[Verse 1]
You ever have a bad dream?
Wake up and it's a sad thing
Paint a picture vivid, no flat screen
Gotta get the cash, C.R.E.A.M
Bright lights, see the flash beams
Life's a movie, better know that scene (haha)
Because I'm the leading actor of these fetus rappers
They all my sons, I gotta breed them faster
I'm undefeated for several reasons, I bring disaster
We need to see the pastor
With decency and laughter
They doubt I beat the chatter
But one day I'm gon' find myself
And I'mma do this shit by myself
But we gon' be straight, give me three days
I'll make a rhyme for pete's sake
Eat lobster and cheesecake
With vodka and cheap Bape
But we gon' get it, and get it again
Different Benz, same friends
I'm committed to win
It's no more lame trends
We is finished with them
And all the hater get a kick in the shin
But we don't fuck with that
Remember time was simple in tenth grade with bucket hats?
Pride gun, I tuck it back
Life crazy, my luck gets bad
Well I'mma say to you
We gon' make it through
And 'til the rain go away, I'm gon' play it cool

[Hook]
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

[Verse 2]
The hex or a spell around it
I'm humble, they tell I'm grounded
They shoot and there's shells around it
Trump and them bell has sounded
The end in times, will we burn for sins and crimes?
Spared for giving spares and shared beginning rhymes
But this is nowhere near the end, though
Miss Dave on the back porch smoking indo
Playing that Nintendo
Chilling with the kin folk
Everything A-OK like tenth floor
But times done got harder
And we done got tougher
I didn't anticipate it
But shit's a lot rougher
But how can you thrive and succeed but not suffer?
The struggle make you real and the nigga got gutter
But soon straight steaks on my plate, hot butter
And everything gonna open up, stop clutter
So I'mma tell you, "Slow your roll, stand tall, don't fold
And everything that glitters ain't gold"
But you should

[Hook]
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

[Outro]
I mean...
You just gotta bounce back from all your L's and come ten time harder. You can't do all the shit you can't change, right?



[Intro]
You make me feel, baby, baby
You make me feel, baby

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
You make me feel like I never ever felt before
So what's the deal? Never answer when I’m at your door
I got the juice, I'm surprised you haven't heard by now
So what to do? Got the foreign, we can cruise the town

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel like a mothafuckin’ boss
Top down, now she wanna take it off
Haters on me, had to learn to shake 'em off

Blow a bag on 'em, what it cost?
Pull them racks up now they lookin' lost
Two arms up, flex on 'em
You do it easy, you don't gotta break a sweat on em

[Chorus: YBN Cordae & YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh

You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
This a mild summer, need new crib, a house hunter
I’m a wild gunner, she go long like route runners
If your spouse wonder, she come to us, a clout gunk
All over with, I promise you that your trial done up
So get back, hit that, gave me whiplash
Get cash, flip packs ’til your wrist crack
'Cause I know you know just what we like
So anything can happen for the night

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel like a mothafuckin’ boss
Top down, now she wanna take it off
Haters on me, had to learn to shake 'em off

Two arms up, flex on 'em

You make me feel
You make me feel like a boss, you make me feel like a boss, ooh

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay]
Gucci shades, you don't let 'em see your eyes
You tired of niggas, they keep tellin' you these lies
Red bottoms in the European size
Bought you a watch for your birthday surprise
Don't mind your friends, all they do is criticize
Dick up in her stomach, now she got butterflies
Matte black Lamb and the doors suicide
Might get down on one knee, hold up, bitch... I lied

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
You make me feel like a mothafuckin' boss
Top down, now she wanna take it off
Haters on me, had to learn to shake 'em off
Hit the gas on 'em, leave 'em lost
Blow a bag on 'em, what it cost?
Pull them racks up now they lookin' lost
Two arms up, flex on 'em
You do it easy, you don't gotta break a sweat on em

[Chorus: YBN Cordae & YBN Almighty Jay]

[Intro]
KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who in front of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

These hoes ain't what they say they are
And their pussy stank, they catfishin'
Same hoes that was sendin' shots
They reachin' out like they back itchin'
Why would I hop in some beef (why?)
When I could just hop in a Porsche?

Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty
I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti
"Ayo Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?"
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti

Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty

[Intro]
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me



[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: SZA]
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I think us bad bitches is a gift from God (gift from God)
I think you broke hoes need to get a job (get a job)
Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks (Cardi)
Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ay, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell)
My little 15 minutes lasting long as hell, huh?

[Chorus: SZA]
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, broke hoes do what they can (can)
Good girls do what they told (told)
Bad bitches do what they want (they want)
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spent what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none)
If they can make you richer, they can make you cum

[Chorus: SZA]
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat
I'ma make your bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit"
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like

[Bridge: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
It's killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night

Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh



[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunt on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" (bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (say it)
Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast, mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (no)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (fucked up)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (woo)
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" (where the check?)
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (blap!)

[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (woo)

[Bridge]
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (yeah)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (ah)
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (grrr)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (grrr)

[Chorus]
We gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten (woo)
Yeah, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (grrr)



[Intro: Kehlani]
Ooh, ooh
Ring, ring, ring, ring

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Should I call first? I can't decide
I want to, but a bitch got pride
The switchin' up shit is what I can't fuck with
I'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with
And you ain't hit me up in a while
Actin' like you don't know what number to dial
You quit, then that's it, I'ma throw in the towel
'Cause a nigga only gon' do what you allow
You don't want this gun smoke
Learn to text with your nose if your thumb broke
I don't care if we get into it and I stall on your ass
Better still wake up to missed calls from your ass, nigga

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Nah, nigga now you gon' have to call me (call me)
'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages, they on me (yeah)
Actin' like they ain't niggas that want me
Let another nigga in your spot, and you gon' be hot nigga, coffee
You gon' be sick to your, stomach
Hit me when you free, 1-800
It's emergency, call me 911
Cause right now I'm out here tryna find someone
The ring on my phone, ring on my finger (brrr)
You actin' like you ain't tryna do either (yeah)
Once a good girl, watch me turn diva
Here goes my heart, I put it on speaker (oh)

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Bridge: Kehlani]
You used to be on my line
On my tick all the time, yeah
Love it when you make me feel
Like you don't mind when I ain't got time for you
And no it don't go to my head, I'm only arrogant in bed
I just love to know you wanna spend time with me instead
Now you all caught up, yeah
You all caught up and you done left me alone, yeah
You was all fed up
Ready for the next step, wanna be on your own
Said I just miss you, I just miss us, baby
All I know is

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring (you don't make it ring, baby)

[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I wanted to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were...
...instead of my head
You found another...
...better one
I won't let you forget me



[Intro]
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same, love

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out of my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane

[Chorus]
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change, before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change, before I go insane, love

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Chorus]
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love



[Intro]
I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

[Verse 1]
What's the 27 Clu-u-u-ub?
We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia
So I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend
I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out
What the fuck is this 'bout?

[Interlude]
I'm tryna make it out
I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out
I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

[Verse 2]
My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to ten



[Intro]
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)

Damn, why is she so demonic?

Smokin' 'til my eyes roll back like the omen
Just another funeral for her, goddamn

Rockstar, that's our style, these boys can't take it (yeah)

Take it, let you roll my weed, please don't lace it, yeah
That's a bum bitch that you chasin', ayy
Foreign with me, she a dominatrix (woah)
I love that girl and I do like her body
"I don't want the money, I just want the molly"
That's what she say when she lived in the Valley
Lil' boy I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Lil Uzi Vert]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted



[Intro]
Daytrip took it to ten
Fine

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Verse 1]
I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the percys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing little bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the worst
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'

[Chorus]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy
With my bros, but I got my pole screaming
"Please don't urge me, please dont urge me", yuh

[Verse]
Screaming "Please don't urge me"
And fuck these hoes, all they do is irk me
I smoke my dope and I pop my perky
And lock my phone 'cause these hoes be lurking, yuh

A bad lil' bitch with her hips so curvy

She ride my dick, off the drugs, she swervin', woah

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip

Really I do care
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)
I never been scared to love (Drop dat bomboclat!)

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 1]
You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
No, I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough

You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 2]
We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

She love Bobby Brown so we keep the 'caine on deck

[Part I: Amphetamine]

[Chorus]
Moonlight disrupt the day
Been like this every night
Walking in stumbling
Fucked up some bread today
Though I said no no this time
Cycles on cycles
It's like an amphetamine
How it marinate on my mind
Stuck on me, yah
Got no doubt I'll be alright
If I just make it through the night

[Verse 1]
Pass me the amphetamine
Right now can't focus on anything
Why they take lil bro instead of me?
I hurt when you hurt, we was siamese
Nigga was seventeen, when I found out what that cheddar mean
Rats'll bite holes through the wall to get close
Watch for their trail, man they always be close
Back-a-wood rolla, really a smoker
This louder than when you drive on the shoulder
Stomp on the gas 'til I'm blowin' the motor
Can't 'ford to sit with my thoughts or it's over
Really but luckily, I got a real one, she fuck wit me
Shawty, she yellow, yeah keep me on my toes, stay mellow
She deserve a fucking ring

[Bridge]
I'm off the sedatives
Amphetamine
I don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm headed
Sedatives
Amphetamine
Sedatives
I don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm headed

Moonlight disrupt the day
Been like this every night
Walking in stumbling
Fucked up some bread today
Though I said no no this time
Cycles on cycles

Got no doubt I'll be alright
If I just make it through the night
Moonlight disrupt the day

[Part II: Krash Kourse]

[Intro]
God damn, [?]
Swn, swn, swn, swn, swn

[Verse: Smino]
Ay
Krash kourse into the world
This insular world
The culture vultures flock in every sense of the word
My nose can sniff the shit out but I'm never deterred
Never be scurred, scored through the downs, first and third
Grandaddy spittin, ain't nothing new bout the system
'Cause how they do me they did him
Appropriating the fellas
Sucking the fruit from my elders
Don't give a Chuck bout no Berry
They rather listen to Elvis
Woah, mama
And these kids know better, uh
I'm grand like abuela, uh
More hands than Coachella, uh
Lil hoe it's whatever, uh
Shawty cold as December, I still fold her, no Manila
B-b-b-brr wit me baby, I hibernate, smoke the lettuce
No niggas jammed off the reggie
Free all my dogs, fuck Kruella
Nigga need cream, vanilla, ele-vate
Coconut Beamer, oiled up, switching lanes
Chocolate interior, that's a belly ache

[Chorus: Bari]
I done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh
She on the payroll, he on the payroll
I want queso, I want the caseload
She do what I say so, now
She fucked up, yeah, she might do the Fabo
Send that RIP, out yeah, and that shit for Shawty Lo
Back when I was broke I had to pour that Bacardi slow
Now I'm on the board, niggas salty like margaritas, ooh
I used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I'm thinking bout when it was me and you, baby
Yeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I think of me and you

[Verse: Jean Deaux]
I don't know what's better, I won't say what's worse
Pen is like a needle when I bleed these words
I could make a blessing if I spit this verse
That's why I be retching 'til I rid my curse
Black it be the sweetest
Secrecy up in the frequencies
That's why you feel the need
To look at me like I'm a deity
Duality is key, you see
That I'm seein' you seein' me
So now we seeing equally
Needlessly to say
I hate that we're meeting this way
Feel like I packed up to go
'Bout a week ago
I don't know
If I switch my flow I might tap into the pinnacles
I'm sellin' syllables, I'm losing principles
Lurkin', searching for miracles
Hurtin' workmen, curtain closed
Earn a million dollars just to owe it to some imbeciles
If they tell me no, I be dumb, all I hear is go
Crossfire coming but I'm pigeon-toed, winter froze

[Chorus: Bari]
I done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh
She on the payroll, he on the payroll
I want queso, I want the caseload
She do what I say so, now
She fucked up, yeah, she might do the Fabo
Send that RIP, out yeah, and that shit for Shawty Lo
Back when I was broke I had to pour that Bacardi slow
Now I'm on the board, niggas salty like margaritas, ooh
I used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I'm thinking bout when it was me and you, baby
Yeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I think of me and you

[Bridge: Smino]
Cunning linguistics
Punishing puns
Pumping the petro, gas in my lungs
Loving the low times, higher than a mug
Up in the cabinet
Imagine a baby reaching his hands up to grab it
A pipe done busted in heaven
And got to leaking out blessings
Reaching my hands up to grab it
Re'in my bands up
Uh, uh

[Verse: Noname]
Sunny metropolis, overzealous as telefone
Telefone a new continent, maybe rode me a rocketship
Copper all on my dash, and he ticket that lady optimist
Said I'm moving too fast, slow down, slow down
Opened up for Lauryn Hill, woah now, woah now
Woah now
Everything is everything and the object steady mystified
My allegories underneath the rock will only fear resides
I bet I'm gon' find it, I know I'm gon' find it
Happiness, bank account, white accountant
I found the fountain
I was born in all black, how could God denounce this?
I told Him, 'Give me my money, I need my money now'
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are
I know you gifted me the gift of gab and simile
And simpleness, the solitude is loneliness
Been good to me
I told them, 'Give me my happy, I need my holy now'
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are

Hold on, wait, LT

Okay, cool

You know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hittin' them push ups
So when I'm up in that wassup, wassup
You get whooped up, uh
Arch that thang like where I'm from
Been on my brain, Miss Serotonin
Livin' la vida with my lavita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs, eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She like, "Smino, boy, I get it already"

[Chorus]
I got a pizza on the way, bae, bae
I'm tryna lay, lay
Lil' lady, ayy, I brought a bouquet of the treefer

Lil' lady, ayy, I brought a bouquet of the treefer
And I'm feelin' like we should d-d-duck away
Netflix and Dusse
And if I do say so myself, that ass a creature

[Verse 2]
She make me feel like, "Oh"
Early in the morning goin' crazy

She make me feel like, "Oh"
Even in the evening, turn into a heathen on me
She make me feel like, "Oh"
Yeah, ooh, ahh
She make me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

I know what I'm talkin' about, alright? I did that for 13 years
I already know, poppa. You really the whole inspiration, for real, you the roots of everything. It's amazing to be here. Really, though, I'm blessed to be able to look and see my history in it, though, and just know where---you know what I'm saying---ended up where I'm at. It's cool
I just know that you have a great talent. I'm serious. You and Andrea, and Brandon, and all of ya'll guys. Good musical talents. Just don't grow outside of yourself. Stay within yourself and develop. Develop until it's fine. 'Cause you don't know what you'll be able to tell your kids one day



[Chorus]
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?

Casa su casa, how's yo Spanish?
You kick it off, home field advantage
Got Gatorade on ice, lil boo, stay cool
Second stop we done made
Can't find no Woods and it's gettin' late
I might just pull over
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Oops, I mean Equinox

Triangles, down, up, circle
My dick a cheat code, I stick for the joy
She sayin' it's sweet, callin' me chico
I dig in her earth deep, she quaking
I'm from juptr, baby get with an alien
Crazy, I popped a little somethin'

And I ain't cold with geometry but you a cute mothafucka

I'm off the holy oil, fried like El Pollo
I got a chicken coop
Dip out, interior barbecue
I'm fly why she want the cockatoo
And that's on my bird like a beak my guy
Standing ovay how they greet my guys
Straight out the mud like a cleat no lie
Never had time for the teeter kind
On the fence like vines, wanna camouflage
Niggas hotel lobbying
Smelling like loud around republicans
Like why it ain't no niggas working? Obvious
Just hella hmm hmm, smiles and muttering
If you ain't blood to me you bothering
And if you ain't cuz to me you cluttering
And I been really tryna be mo' tolerant, mo' positive
Prolly need to switch up countries (But you know why I’m here)
I might go beast mode

Out in Shoreditch with the shit, ain't no shortage on the stick
Lil boo I know you gone

Gold, oh (oh ah ow, oh!)
Don’t got no time for delay
Hopping around in a sack race
Bro keep that 'caine like Larenz Tate
He went overload on the Oberweis
Nigga at his lowest gave me word to wise
Told me none of this matter unless, family blessed
Watch all these niggas that beat on they chest
They flex through they stress
I guess

I Ginuwine up on you, tryna fit up
Up in em, witcha acting innocent
Bet you're interested, stretch you like a limo
The memo, never switched or slowed the tempo
Zero gang with me every-where I go
I’m cool on, all the friendly shit
It's just business, straight across 12:30 o’clock, uh
1000 miles an hour on a spaceship, maybe we can go to space
(Now I ain't never been to Jupiter before but I- but I'll go witchu baby)
Got that mag'netic love, I can’t pull out of yo Milky Way

Aw they hate it when you smile nah
They lactose tolerant, I cheese on 'em
Smino compadre, speak up
Me no speak no english
Country country my lingo
Smell the smoke, that shit linger
Smino di grigio these hoes dutty wine
Bumper cars in the Beamer
Bunk beds, ain't no space
Fuck you thought? I don't team up
Stick with my familia
We go back like Girbauds and wife beaters
Back in the space when they tried to delete us
We blew G's and stay G'd up

[Chorus]
And I'm just sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
All of the
Money that
I could be
Getting right now
Wasting my time
What you doin'
I told you I
Only got
Time for these
Benjis I count
I only come through for that guarantee
That right on time, that exactly what I need
I need that guarantee

[Verse 2]
Smi D Pablo keep a freak-a-leek
Greedy hoes they want a piece of me
Mama told me about these phony frolickers
My apologies I can't let y'all drain me
Smi-know better than to trust gimmicks
Smino, more like Smi-Yeah
Young Denzel train all day
Run shit here, ya'll just live here
Smino-ly Bible I live by
Cross my heart, hope to die nigga if I'm lying
Only bands make me march
I beat the odds like a drum line
And I ain't never in a rush
I ain't no Russian, I'm a blkswn
Being timeless how I pass time
Scheming, plotting 'til it's attack time

[Chorus]
And I'm just sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
All of the
Money that
I could be
Getting right now
Wasting my time
What you doin'
I told you I
Only got
Time for these
Benjis I count
I only come through for that guarantee
That right on time, that exactly what I need
I need that guarantee
Sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
All of the
Money that
I could be
Getting right now
Wasting my time
What you doin'
I told you I
Only got
Time for these
Benjis I count
I only come through for that guarantee
That right on time, that exactly what I need
I need that guarantee

[Outro]

[Intro]
Black (Jupiter). Black (Jupiter). Black. Black. Black. Black

[Verse 1]
Got me sweating like...
Black hoodie
Black Timbs
Black leather jacket
Sun beatin' on my black skin
Black queen wit me say the blacker the berry
Makes a spectacular cherry
Know I got more buttons than a Blackberry
Push em all tryna evolve and break outta
Black holes in my heart in the dark I can breathe proper
Feel the fruits of my labor no talkin' just show niggas
Foot stomped on my apple by Adam like choke nigga
Switch up I want the big booties and big trucks
Soul food nigga yam flippa
Sweet potato barrel genocide silent killer
These tears dry quicker on Versace pillows
Feel a lil' better when ya thread count thicker
Can't get it off my chest shit a hiccup
My main thang always gettin' extra ripped up
World cold roll a zip-up
Got a lil swish swish
Smell my shit comin' young windbreaker
I'm a Z-E-R-O lex time comin'
I think you know our time comin'
Young forever they old hit stage break a leg nigga OJ Mayo
High stuntin'
I bee alone sometimes honey
Wonder if you hive time for me
Never let a day go
With out me blacking out on all these pesos
Crazy cause I...

[Chorus]
I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody in and
You are the one
I need to see
So hit me
My line is still the same when I...

For a ride

[Outro: Smino + Female Vocalist]
Black (Jupiter). Black (Jupiter). Black (Jupiter). Black. Black

I know I've never been before (I know you've never been before)
You know I've never been before (?so down this shit it gets lonely?)

Won't' you take me babe
Won't' you take me babe (yeah baby babe, know I've never been before babe, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)



[Chorus: Smino & Rayvn Lenae]
Walking light on these glass flows
My tippy's, I'm toe up
You know what, I'm thinking
I think
I think I made you too special
You took me, you shook me, you shh me
When I tried to think about you, babe
Walking past my feet
See, why you never need me?
You was really a vessel
You cut it, It blooded
I bled out, you ran out
It's dead now

[Verse 1: Smino & Rayvn Lenae]
Lately I been thinking 'bout your glow again
Lately I been, lately I been thinking 'bout a go again
Don't you know my diamond soul?
Don't you know my time is gold?
Lately I been drinking, still dehydrated
'Lil chocolate water, Henny got me callin', hello operator
Tell lil' shawty, grab the phone
Fuck around, done been too long
If I had another chance, I'd throw you off my back
If I knew you had a plan, I'd never say attack
Pity, pity, pitty pat, long paragraphs
Make me tisk when you get like that
Fall back, took a trip
Roll the luggage, burnin' pack
Fuck that, feelin' like I need a new thing

[Chorus: Smino & Rayvn Lenae]
Walking light on these glass flows
My tippy's, I'm toe up
You know what, I'm thinking
I think
I think I made you too special
You took me, you shook me, you shh me
When I tried to think about you, babe
Walking past my feet
See, why you never need me?
You was really a vessel
You cut it, It blooded
I bled out, you ran out
It's dead now

[Verse 2: Smino & Rayvn Lenae]
Rest assured, you about to ruin your pedicure
Tippy-toeing this nigga in the Chi
Ca I go with ya, huh?
Feelin' like any nigga in the room can be the guy
Feelin' like every bitch I bone a skeleton of mine
Prolly why I felt insecure that one night out Chi
Ca I go back in time, can I Michael J. Fox?
Prolly call up Lil' Bari and turn Delorean to hotbox
Moon child, lil' shawty cry shootin' stars any time she cry
Cry me a river, I'll teach you how to build a boat
I'm John Cena with visual
You can't see me, can't see me, no
I can't, I can't control myself
(Oh my God, you're in my head)
I can't, I can't control my health
(Oh my God, you're in my bed)

[Chorus: Smino & Rayvn Lenae]
Walking light on these glass flows
My tippy's, I'm toe up
You know what, I'm thinking

I think I made you too special
You took me, you shook me, you shh me
When I tried to think about you, babe
Walking past my feet

Yea yea yea yea

Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin' (yeah yeah)
Want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

[Verse 1: Smino]
What would the sauce be, I said
Without the pasta and bread
Give me some space as of late
I been feeling a little bit claustrophobic
Long as the squad getting fed
And real niggas bobbin' they head
I know I'ma be cool
My weed a million decibels
My lungs heavy as a pool
Quit watching the news
Niggas starting making news
Had to make a fucking move
Shake the city up
Had me in the glove like Gary P
Supersonics got em all hooked
Monte found me now we all booked
No fatigue we in another league
Shawty top me when it's rubbery
Take a lot to keep a G intrigued
Ion know that's just the G in me
They been pumping the team up like creatine
Recently feel like I'm losing my memory
Don't got much tick on my tock
I be missing my block
Momma I love you, know pops hold it down
New jack from the city bitch I'm Smino Brown
My hat be my home she rollin' up stoned
And we both runnin' fucked in the moment

[Hook: Smino]
And we just want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin'
Want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin'
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

[Verse 2 Jay2ainshit]
Yeah pace it pace it
Wonder bread took the flag race it race it
Just hope I got patience look at me
[?] just picked up a placement
It ain't no service swear I'm just roaming and walking
Still ain't got a car, miss the bus bummy walking to the function
Might sprint if I can, but I'm on my last bar
Life in a chokehold like Bart
Better be playing your part
Better be winning a lot
Better not be like these niggas that black out in jams like pajamas they in it a lot
Like bitch I'm a sinner a lot
Moms in the ER room often missed dinner a lot
Talking this shit while I'm burning this dope got me floating through turbulence baby I'm way way way up
Stuck in my ways ways ways uh
Throwing my cape cape cape
This ain't for saving hoes I just feel super when I rap this lucrative back in the day, uh
I would be like fuck this class let's go downtown baby let's come up on a stain ya
It ain't no room to complain, burn it they still said it burnt up my brain

[Hook: Smino]
And we just want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted

Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life

Yo, It's just gon be me and you, yeah yeah come through
Poppa gone get chu poppin- aight true



[Chorus: Smino]
My heart on my sleeve
Boom-boom-ka-boom
Straight face when I grieve
Put the Remy on the ice
Edgar Allan Poe'd up, lean on me
The deuce, the deuce
Growed up too damn quick
Shawty sucked me, I was 9

[Verse 1: Smino]
Stoned like a path through gardens
Green plants, nigga a botanist
Soon as I get the deposit
Loud man, liquor regardless
Uber to the pussy, I'm ballin'
Gucci on my balls in the Balmain
No plan, movin' with no brain
Wonder why I'm feelin' mundane
Same old cycle of trife, oh
Plan on breakin' the cycle
'Til lil' shawty send me them nudes
Then it's back to the titties and tight rolls
Thank God for that body
God for this bottle
She a Coca-Cola copy
And she know Smino Papi
Gon' be feenin' for her
Head game crackin'
She a cluck with the fuck
Right now I'm on a roll
No time to butter you up

[Chorus: Smino]
My heart on my sleeve
Boom-boom-ka-boom
Straight face when I grieve
Put the Remy on the ice
Edgar Allan Poe'd up, lean on me
The deuce, the deuce
Growed up too damn quick
Shawty sucked me, I was 9

[Verse 2: TheMIND]
So I don't really want to talk about my feeling in here
Any, meeny, miny mo mo mo mo whiskey to spare?
Emptied my bottle now she counting her tears
Said lately she been sitting on the mountain of fear
Of what?
May be I can't open up to yo inquisitions
Talking bout your people's and expect me to sit and listen
And they don't even like my ass
I know, I know my bad
Big trouble in little China
She say can't even kill a nigga wit kindness, heart lost on mixtape, dammit where did you find it?
Opportunities knocking, walk you ass thru that front door
Put your pride in your lymph nodes
Know this world is so cut throat
And a heart don't mean shit if you ain't using it

[Verse 1]
Right now I'm (uh)
I'm rollin round in disbelief
My Garcia Vega
Hold my weed
Them swisher sweets are not for me

Apparently I lost my cap
My head I bought the strap and stabbed without the contraception
Fuck I be on
Chasing bread to relish in the moment
Still be playing catch up out here giving hoes the raw polish, whoa
I really need to turtle down
Unheard of
My new bitch booty need a girdle
My new shit sound like years of rehearsal

[Chorus]
Got me ducking o-o-off, yeah, ducking off
You so fucking raw, aw damn, now we fucking raw
Drop my fucking jaw, then drop off in yo draws
Oh my God, you just made me miss my ride
Shit one time
You got me ducking o-o-off, yeah, ducking off
You so fucking raw, aw damn, now we fucking raw
Drop my fucking jaw, then drop off in yo draws
Oh my God, you just made me miss my ride

[Bridge]
I guess I can stay a little longer
Just a little more
We ran outta weed, go grab a little more
I used my last raincoat
She say it's pouring
Oh my God, so much more to the story

[Verse 2]
I can't help myself
Sometimes I can't help myself
That thang a water-park like every time I slide thru, slide thru
Taking Lyfts at 4am to lift my spirits
I don't think you hear me
Spending every dime on my mood, my mood
Aw It's lit
Hot night in Chicago
White lights at the front doe
You know I just fell back from some real shit
Tryna heal quick
Shit, Guess it's your turn to talk doe
On the mic at the night show
Little spit and a little lip
Cue the bright lights on that ass doe
Maybe we last
Maybe we fuck and we learn (Oh Yeah)
Girl if we crash
We gone have to let it burn (Yeah)
And if they find that black box
They gone hear El Capitan giving you back shots
In the cockpit
Slopped
Drank a 5th now it's
5 O'clock on the dot
I'm hitting yo spot
Rubbing them cheeks
When I slide inside of this
Sound like the Mac and the cheese
I need a better diet
Really, cuz u really got me

[Chorus]
Got me ducking o-o-off, yeah, ducking off
You so fucking raw, aw damn, now we fucking raw
Drop my fucking jaw, then drop off in yo draws
Oh my God, you just made me miss my ride
Shit one time
You got me ducking o-o-off, yeah, ducking off
You so fucking raw, aw damn, now we fucking raw
Drop my fucking jaw, then drop off in yo draws
Oh my God, you just made me miss my ride

[Bridge]
I guess I can stay a little longer
Just a little more
We ran outta weed, go grab a little more
I used my last raincoat
She say it's pouring
Oh my God that's the end of the story, yeah

[Intro: Nas]
Here we are
Here we are
Yeah
This one right here is for the people

[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord

[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?

[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless.... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn

[Outro: Nas]
This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali, Patience, yeah



[Verse 1]
Hadi bakalım, geri basalım yok hiç bi' kazanım
Müzikten tekdüze yaşancak hazanı
Durduramadı akıl, neye tapalım?
Üstüne tükür'cek gece sabahın

Çünkü alkolü fazla içtiler
Eğlenip öldüler aşka düştüler
Arandı bi' şeyler alındı meşgule
Tombala poker çizik, nasıl meşgale

Bi' de İzmir’i yüksekten izlerken
Havai fişekler, meşale, siren
Park etmiş araçlar radyoda Tilbe
Yıldızlar düşmüş özlenmiş anne küsmüş

Kimi sevdiğine, kimi benliğine
Bugün ben değil ben
Kimi vurulmuş kan akar her yerinden
Kimi kovulmuş sabahtan iş yerinden

Bi' de bu günden
Sanki sonrası yalan gibi yaşanmış dünlere düşlere bir de
Eylül’e isyan, en başta düşenler iplere tutsak

Hayat kadınları çöpçüler falan
Otoparklar, birahane, barlar
Kodamanlar, virane sokaklar
Bu gece sabahın üstüne kus'çak

[Hook: Berk Bayat & Gazapizm]
Bu gece insanlara bak
Dozajı kaçırmışlar kim ki bunlar?
Bu gece insanlara bak
Bi' değişik hepsi bak bi' değişik manyak
Bu gece insanlara bak
Planlaman yanlış bak buna kalkışma
Bu gece insanlara bak
İşlenen tüm suçlar üstüne kal'cak

[Verse 2]
Maganda holigan deplasman yasak
Kepenk kapatmış tüm esnaflar kaçak
Kimi korktup da gözlerini kıs'çak
Bu gece sabahın üzerine bas'çak

Kalk! Güzeline koş'caz
Deyip paket ol'caklar üzerine sonra
Düşüp denize yüzemi'cek onlar
Gene gece sabahın düzenini boz'cak

Gene fakirlik şöyle bi dur'cak
Yanında bi' çocuk var elinde oyuncak
Vitrinde mankenler, popüler müzikler
Kimi kendiyle konuşur bi' şeyler

Ambulanslar bi' de acil servisler
Gece kulüpleri, lüks otomobiller
Sentetik haplarla gül serotoninler
Bu gece dünküyle çok fotokopiyken

Sabah olsun ahan da tüm paran yalan olmuş
Tabii şaka dostum
Şarkıma söz bi' de makam olmuş
Bugün elinde taş bi' de sapan tutmuş

Çocuk baktıkta baya bi' yapan yapmış
Bunu duyduk ki kendini yakanlar olmuş
Bir rüzgar esmiş ve deniz kudurmuş
Bu gece sabahın yüzünden suçlu

[Hook]



[Verse]
In the heart of the holy see
In the home of Christianity
The seat of power is in danger
There's a foe of a thousand swords
They've been abandoned by their lords
Their fall from grace will pave their path, to damnation

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the 189
In the service of heaven
They're protecting the holy line
It was 1527, gave their lives on the steps to heaven
Thy will be done!

[Chorus]
For the grace, for the might of our lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

For the grace, for the might of our lord
In the name of his glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again

[Verse]
Under guard of 42
Along a secret avenue
Castel saint angelo is waiting
They're the guard of the holy see
They're the guards of Christianity
Their path to history is paved with salvation

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the 189
In the service of heaven
They're protecting the holy line
It was 1527, gave their lives on the steps to heaven
Thy will be done!

[Chorus]
For the grace, for the might of our lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

For the grace, for the might of our lord
In the name of his glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Dying for salvation with dedication
No capitulation, annihilation
Papal commendation, reincarnation
Heaven is your destination

Dying for salvation with dedication
No capitulation, annihilation
Papal commendation, reincarnation
Heaven is your destination

In the name of god

[Chorus]
For the grace, for the might of our lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

For the grace, for the might of our lord
In the name of his glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story
Gave their lives so boldly
Come and tell the Swiss Guards' story again

[Intro: Jean Deaux]
Got it, I got it, oh
Say what you're looking for, 'cause I got it, yeah, ay
I got it, I got it, oh
I got it, yeah

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is right
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Verse 1: Saba]
Ay, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, I'm on the West Side, still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now, coz the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high offa life, arrive unannounced
Summonin', numbin' the pain of when I'm in doubt, high school
My head in the clouds, like I learned about

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Post-Hook: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)
All the thing's you adore
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)

[Verse 2: Saba]
Runnin' through my city like a tour bus
Hopin' one day I can have a tour bus
I can see the planets from my window sill
And I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
Dead end the school, but they'll show up tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognise
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Post-Hook: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
All, the thing's you adore
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
Show what you want, show what you want
Show what you want, show what you want

[Outro: Billy Williams]
I just wanna be the plug so my people can eat
I just wanna play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo
I just wanna find somewhere I don't gotta put a face on for people no mo'
Yours truly, Billy Williams



[Part I: "BUSY"]

[Verse 1: Saba]
I'm so alone, but all of my friends
But all of my friends got some shit to do
Yeah, all 'em got plans
I call 'em, I'm bad at texting
They never cross me like bad pedestrians
I've been this awkward since adolescence
I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure
I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my BFF, that ain't no secret kept
I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin'
I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty
Surely deservin' of all this lonely
"You sad? Tell me, how are you sad?
You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans"
I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in
Jesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat
I'm tryna cope, but it's a part of me gone
In this packed room I'm alone

[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 2: Saba]
I'm so alone, just me and my girl
She leave me for work, then leave me for school
She finally home, I leave her for tour
FaceTime me nudity, yeah, all of this new to me, yeah
All of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up
It still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'
Niggas askin' me how tour was
Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk like two dimes
No time, social interaction
Had female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk
It'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
Cause the friendships that I can't recall
Done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with
Doin' shit that I can't endorse now
With the Lord now, when it pours down
Was alone then, still alone now

[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 3: theMIND]
I'm barely here, how I ain't present?
Yeah, I drift for a second, forgot to reply to your message
But all these years
I been the same in your presence (I'm still here)
Countin' the seconds before I reply to your message
My biggest fear (is that I have to say goodbye another time)
Is that I have to say goodbye another time
(Not like this, not like this, not like this)
So I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this
I don't need nobody new to miss (not like this)
I want you to know
Ooooh, ooh ooh, ohh

[Part II: "SIRENS"]

[Chorus: Saba]
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, yeah

[Verse: Saba]
Ridin' through the city
I'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty
I know one time wanna kill me
They don't know me but they fear me
15 years old with the sticky
They gon' blame it on the marijuana
Hands behind your head
And they won't let up out they lead
But if I move thats disrespect
But if they shoot then that's just that?
And if I run then that look bad?
Drawing they gun right off their hip
I'm probably deservin'
'Cause I know they serve and protect
But they think I'm servin'
Or they think my cellphone's a weapon
Heard that the robber wore a black mask
I fit the description, a.k.a. "nigga"
What is the difference? It's an enigma
We so divided, I'm from Division
Clutch that purse cause of my dreadlocks
Cross that street cause I'm with my friends
Curse every song in hip-hop
Keep telling yourself it's a fad

[Chorus: Saba]
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah
Sirens on the way, ayy
Now we're lying where the—



[Verse 1: Saba]
I got angels runnin' 'way, I got demons huntin' me
I know 'Pac was 25, I know Jesus 33
I tell Death to keep a distance, I think he obsessed with me
I say, "God, that's a woman," I know she would die for me
They want a barcode on my wrist (barcode on my wrist)
To auction off the kids
That don't fit their description of a utopia (black)
Like a problem won't exist if I just don't exist
If I grew up without a single pot to piss in
Pardon me for ventin'
Congress got the nerve to call theyself religious
Rich just gettin' richer, we just tryna live our life

[Chorus: Saba]
Momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was honor roll, talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them will get along
Momma beggin' him for winter coats
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook now they tryna take his—

[Post-Chorus: Saba]
Life don't mean shit to a nigga that ain't never had shit, yeah
Light don't mean lit in the dark, fight don't mean fists, ooh
Eyes don't see, eyes don't see, ice don't freeze
Light don't leave, I don't mean lie to me

[Bridge: Saba]
Tell me it'll be okay, tell me happier days
Tell me that she my bae, that I won't be alone
Tell 'em I'll be okay when he ask, "How's my day?"
Tell 'em that we the same, tell em' that we not safe

[Verse 2: Saba]
I got my grandaddy soul, I'm at war, that's on my mind
I seen Walter body cold, wish I could switch it with mine
I'm not worried 'bout no rap shit, distractions or waste-of-times
I still go to social functions even though I'm so anti—
No, I'm no Rihanna, the court gonna throw it like Donovan
Down a bit, I just been modelin' my whole career
As if 'Pac was here, studio monitors shakin'
I raise the apartments, I'm Bono with profit
I made what I made in allotted
Amount of time the same amount of time you was watchin'
So stop comparing me to people, no, I am not them
A lot of people dream until they shit'll get—*gunshot*

[Chorus: Saba]
That's life, momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was honor roll, talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them will get along
Momma beggin' him for winter coats
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook now they tryna take his life



[Intro: Saba]
And I’m from the part of the city that they don’t be talking about
Austin my grandmama house
Madhouse on Madison, middle school graduate
Coulda been traffickin'
But I would rather do better than my uncle had it
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip

[Hook: Saba]
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy

[Verse 1: Saba]
And I’m from the part of the city that they don’t be talking about
Austin my grandmama house
Madhouse on Madison, middle school graduate
Coulda been traffickin'
But I would rather do better than my uncle had it
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip
Slept on the palette
Promised my momma I'd turn it to palace
My granny house was right by Wallace’s Catfish
Corner but lo and behold when its below zero and you watch your best friend hit the corner
And now I no longer even know him
Used to hoop daily we thought we was Jordan
He went on to high school but dropped out a junior
I went on to college he we went on a shooter he went on to juvi
I went out on tour
Bicycle with the juice in the wheel if you was a real nigga
We wouldn’t have to hear ya keep proving yourself 'cause who really cares bout
What side or block your reppin
Your whereabouts will keep you seperate
All lost some niggas to some weapons
Thats why I’m walking like I’m welcome
Hennessy bet they’ll buy that
Just to pour it on the curb
We blinded like an eyepatch
Til your boy is in a hearse
Where the westside at? Shouts the thugs shouts the nerds
Shout the kids claiming Chiraq know you born in the burbs boy

[Hook]
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy

[Verse 2: Saba]
And I'm from the part of the city that they don't be talking about
I gave the west side a new meaning
I took it to the Europeans
The police took my nigga freedom I probably be in there with him
Cause honestly I think just like all my niggas
And honestly I should’ve reached out to Twista like aye bro I got one I need you on this one
Austin, Division, ironic that that's the divide
Below the poverty line
My mother was on the southside
ZMoney told me hit his line
I caught the bus off of Pine
I say my words double time
Knock on wood I have not ever been robbed
But a few niggas tried on the train on my way to school a couple times

[Hook]
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy

[Verse 3: Joseph Chilliams]
And I’m from a part of the city I was sitting on my front porch when I saw my first tittie
Proud to throw the westside up when I was five watching Pac dissing Biggie
Whole fit off of Madison eating Uncle Remus fuck a Whole Foods
Shorty used to act like Stone Cold flipping niggas off cracking cold brews
Westside prep was my old school
The block was hot like Suzanne Somers
Seen someone that got hit with a shotty walk a block while he shitted his body
Cops came started lifting his body
I went back to watching NickToons
Watch your back when its mid june
You can always be my big spoon
Know you in the hood when you see the poles with the blue lights steady flashing like cheerleader clothes I remember letters in the first grade cause of GDs and fours
Mama speaking in code tryna get a job at the store
Never gonna get it like En Vogue
All my westside niggas go

[Skit: Stunt Taylor]
On my bucket list, I want ten million dollars in my bank account
And I want to fuck ten bitches at the same time
This your boy, Stunt Taylor



[Part I: "PROM"]

[Verse: Saba]
This remind me of before we had insomnia
Sleepin' peacefully, never needed a pile of drugs
Everybody was college-bound, no dollar amounts
In God we trust, senior year my prom ain't had no party bus
My cousin hit me on Facebook like, "What shorty you takin'?"
I'm lyin', I'm playin', I'm sayin', "I got one to take"
And I'm waitin' on her response, wrote her a three-page letter
It's three days later, never hit me back, she broke my heart
So now he IM'ing me shit like, "Yo, is shorty bad?"
I pretend not to be depressed, she never wrote me back
I hit him back like "Yo, well fuck her, it's on to the next"
I wrote that message thinkin' I'm awkward, prolly never have sex
You know in high school, 16, you prolly late
My cousin hit me back, "Don't trip, bro, I got you a date"
So he sent me this link to some girl I had never seen
He said to call and tell her "Walter sent you, you with me"
I think about it for a minute like what's his intentions?
I mean we never really got along or used to kick it
In fact if I remember vividly, he picked on me
He used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit
I'm skeptical to let her know I'm Walter' little cousin
What if this shit all a joke? Then again, what if it wasn't?
Would I really risk the chance of me potentially fuckin'
On some stranger daughter cause I barely know if I can trust him?
Prolly not
I finally called her, tell her "Walter sent me, my name Tahj"
She asked me what's the color scheme that we gon' wear to prom
I'm actin' like I'm not excited, tryna play it off
"So what's the car we're takin'?" "Worst come worst, her mom can take us"
I'll call Walt to thank him, he said "Don't trip and just wear black"
He said she cool and they go back, if any problems, hit him back
I never had to, but now we in tune
He Facebook messaged me like, "Sorry, not to be a nuisance"
But he like 30 dollars short on all his prom suit shit
I'm like, "I got you, cuz, that's the least that I could do"
He tell me send him the addy and he'll slide after school
I'm like, "Okay, bet," never knew where he stayed at
He walked down the street hella surprised
"This where y'all place at?
Uncle Carl, Auntie Deborah, my cousin Rena?"
And I'm surprised too, my family knew, kept this a secret
Me and cuz stay down the street, living different lives
Every day he on the bus, me, I get a ride
I gave him 30 on the porch, he never went inside
He tells me, "Thank you," then he walked back home with a smile
He tryna hide it but I see his dimple
I'm thinkin', "Damn, that transaction was simple"
I'm talking shit, I know he hoop, I'm like, "Ay, where the rim, bro?"
He like, "Tomorrow if you free, you prolly weak as shit though"
I know my brother not
So all three of us went to the park and ran some niggas off the court
I'm hella passive, I was passin', I ain't have to score
The next day the prom, I couldn't sleep, I stayed up
My granddad gave me a condom then walked away, didn't say nun'
She hopped out of her car and said that her name was Jada
My heart's racin', I'm focused, I'm tryna keep it playa
Gave her the croissant or corsage or whatever the fuck
My mom handed me, and said, "Now put it on her hand, Malik"
Family ties, my grandfather taught me how to tie up a tie
'Cause my dad lived in NY
That's prolly why I was shy, so self-conscious
Took pictures on the porch and then we headed for the prom and
Walter went on prom the same day, but to a different place
So he text me like, "Cuz, this the spot, let's meet up later
And bring Jada through," prom flashed, I kept it cool
We show up to the function where she brought a change of clothes
I'm lookin' around like, "Damn, I don't know nobody"
We at this party out west, and Jada left to get dressed
I fake like I'm sendin' text, some stranger get really close
I swear that I hear his breath then he put a knife to my neck
Gave me the run down like, "Jada my sister
And if you hit her, fuck her, make her miss ya, I'ma kill ya!"
At this point, I'm just exhausted wonderin' where the fuck's Walter
He shows up like 30 minutes after our altercation
I never mentioned it to him, he kinda overprotective
And I know if I tell him, that he'll beat this nigga's skull in
Turn his body a skeleton, and our night'll end terrible
I exhale and say, "Fuck it", and I just chose to let it go

[Part II: "KING"]

[Skit]
Fuck with you boy
Said you're used to getting everything your way
This not how that happens this time
She tryna fuck with you boy

[Verse 1: Saba]
Walt went to St. Louis, had a full ride for his hoopin'
Him and his coach got into it, now he back home doin' music, ay
I was at Columbia, a damn near straight A student
I had one B in a hip-hop class, I thought that shit was stupid
He transferred to Robert Morris, oh its lit, we down the street
My class let out at 2:40 and his class let out at 3
Mama asked me where the hell I been at, where the hell I be
"I'm with Walter, mom, I'm safe" I keep walkin' in here late
I might fall off in your bae, I get girls now, I get laid
I get caught up I blame Walter, I'm a product of my age
He talk to every girl downtown Chicago, wingman, I cannot fly though
He was in Cal white Impala, he was that nigga in the party
Awfully popular for someone that they barely mention
Plus we from the part of city that they barely mention
Just logged into Twitter and somehow we was barely mentioned
We signed our names on the open mic list and then they skipped us
And then they skipped us again like a week later
Like obviously this fuckin' host can't read the paper
Hella' intimidatin', a big guy didn't have to flex
So Walter walked to the host and said, "This the name you callin' next"
Bullied our way to the stage and then overstayed our welcome
An apple never get too far from the tree that it fell from
Just like my father tryna do music and hope I make it
Walter joined me for the journey said the city waitin'
PIVOT

[Verse 2: Saba]
Walter invincible, dodged death like a mad magician
More times than a mathematician
I'm in L.A. workin' on Bucket List Project, I get a call and get a fishy feeling
Normally Walt joke on the phone, this time he over serious
My heart dropped and I'm like, "Yo, what is it?!"
He say he with T-Y on the highway and some niggas just tried to kill him
Emptied the clip on the car but somehow they didn't hit him
Sometimes I fuckin' hate Chicago cause I hate this feelin'
Innocent niggas get shot at in the broad day, the AM
I asked him for a play-by-play of how their whole day went
He say he went to XSport and they ran a full court
And I can not retort without thinkin' that this can't be the reason
"So what else you do? What about Ty? Is he still cool?
Where you on your way from and where you on your way to?"
He say he just left a dinner at a friend crib and that's it
He say "Ty don't do shit but smoke, honestly Saba, that's it"
Give him sympathy, another case of mistaken identity
The news prolly gon' run this as two gangs from different streets
Police questionin' him like he just shot at a trooper
My boy walked away unharmed and we did Lollapalooza, yeah
Six months pass by, everyday we celebrate, everyday a better day
I just dropped Bucket List, Walt about to drop a tape
Everything goin' perfect, couldn't paint a better way
PIVOT gang is on the way, we just sold out Lincoln Hall
Then I went to talk to Sway
I got back home and got back on it
'Cause Walt was doin' two a days
Sendin' me links to songs that he made
Kid Cudi, we are not ridin' no waves, ay
Grandma made his plate, we played 2K, that's just a day before
Fatimah got a show tomorrow, he text me, "Ay, we in that hoe"
I went to the barbershop, the first thing the next mornin'
Then I got up with LEGIT, we supposed to do some recordin'
Ten minutes into the session, I got a call from a number
That I don't got saved, but I answer anyways
She says, "Hello, Malik, have you or Squeak
Talked to my son today? He was just on the train"
We got in the car but we didn't know where to drive to
Fuck it, wherever you are my nigga, we'll come and find you...

[Outro: John Walt]
Just another day in the ghetto
Oh, the streets bring sorrow
Can't get up today with their schedule
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow



[Intro]
Segreteria telefonica, 3472456056
Lasciate un messaggio (bip)

[Strofa 1]
Ehi, ce l'hai un momento?
È la sesta volta che ti chiamo e trovo sempre spento
È sabato sera, non so dove cazzo sei
Spero almeno che tu ti stia divertendo
Io sono seduto sopra il pavimento
Pensavo "quant'è triste questo appartamento"
Il lavandino perde ancora e a parte questo
Ho una calibro nove sotto il mento
Sai, volevo solo dirti quello
Che in tutti questi anni io non ti ho mai detto
Ti ho chiamata non per nulla d'importante
Ma perché tu mi dessi solo un valido motivo
Per non premere il grilletto
Ma in fondo non vedo cosa cambi
Visto che sono già morto
Dentro, da troppo tempo
Rumore bianco in sottofondo e il mio volto spento

[Ritornello]
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male...

[Strofa 2]
Perfetto, adesso ho pure il cellulare scarico
Forse perchè stanotte ti ho chiamata troppe volte
Pensa, ironia della sorte
Ma è proprio vero che 'sti cosi poi diventano parte di noi
Ora entrambi andiamo incontro alla morte
Più ti parlo più mi spengo
Senza caricatore, il mio cuore sta al 3%
Le mie condizioni qui peggiorano
I demoni mi divorano, emozioni che si svuotano
Quattro pasticche e basta nel mio stomaco
Non c'è mai fine e queste medicine non funzionano
No, non funzionano, oggi come ieri
Sono sempre gli stessi pensieri che mi ossessionano
E mentre affondo mi dico che c'è ancora spazio per un sogno
Come una madre pazza culla un figlio morto
Mi senti? Pronto?

[Ritornello]
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male

[Strofa 3]
Qualche anno fa pensavo sarei morto come un re
E invece finisce tutto su questo parquet
No, non mi hai mai visto così
E con piacere ti presento la parte più buia di me
Quella che non vorresti mai vedere
Quella che ti ho sempre nascosto per il tuo bene
Quella che adesso ha preso il sopravvento
E che si chiede perché cazzo non stai rispondendo
Io non ho più tempo, non ho più voglia
Non ho sogni nel cassetto ma pillole per l'insonnia
La vita è bella, sì, una bella troia
Che però si tira fuori il cazzo quando poi si spoglia
E me ne vado a fare in culo, tanto so la strada
Stanco di me, di te, di 'sta telefonata
Io sto a metà tra un pazzo che ha perso il senno
E un bambino che gioca con una granata
E ho finito, concentro tutte le mie forze su quel dito
Chiudo gli occhi, tiro un sospiro
E attendo che l'ultima goccia cada dal lavandino

[Ritornello]
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male
È che non mi fa più male
E la cosa che mi fa più male

Right away, ay

[Chorus: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm havin'
Ain't no beauty in the absence of broadcastin to your fol-ol-lowers
I seen a celeb get naked
I seen obsessive behavior, I see famous people all-all o-ver
I don't want no autograph
I just want a follow back, maybe tag to ya' fol-ol-lowers

[Verse 1: Saba]
Playback, say that
That just the way that the game go
After the rain it's a rainbow
I see a product you pay for
Shit get forgotten a day old
If I cannot log on, they starting a rumor
That I had got shot like a day ago
I don’t walk without my headphones
I don't got cable in my crib
I don't even know how we got here
Bein' dependent is my fear
Government look like the mafia
Censorin' out what you watchin'
Internet turned me inanimate object
Solitaire more than a game with your card
Can't change the channel, it'll stay in our heart
Stay in the public and pray to your God
Need validation, I'm too insecure
Characters defined one hundred and forty
Two hundred and eighty, a post to your story
I'm from the 2-90, two sides to each story
Yeah, I'll be your friend, but you cannot follow me

[Chorus: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
Look at how much fun I'm havin'

[Bridge: Saba]
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think they got ev—, ooh
Everybody insecure, especially people with everything
Why else you think they got everything?
How else you think I got every—, look

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Everything's on camera, everything's on camera
Everybody want handouts, everybody got pamphlets
Everybody want Santa, everything is on camera
Everybody want pics now, everybody got antlers
Everybody my kid now, everybody got pampers
Everything is on me now, everybody got cameras
Ain't nobody got Chancellor, ain't nobody got answers
All them scratchin' they head now, ain't nobody got dandruff
Don't nobody like selfies on they own page
I know people with they friend requests as they homepage
Ain't put a picture on they wall since the Stone Age
Feel locked up in they own cage when they on stage

[Outro: Saba]
If you press logout, you get forgotten
What's a post but a reminder just how boring our lives a-a-a-are?
