 [Sample]
Remember, there's always tomorrow
P. Soul on the track

[Verse]
Uh, ayy, uh, ayy, uh
Can you rap like me? Huh
Uh, ayy, uh, ayy, uh
I gotta get my fresh paper, boy optimistic, inflicted the premonition
My vision a place I visit while lifted
Moolah I get it get it, the life I live my decision
They told me to go and get it, I got it so now I'm winning
Revolution of fury, the lean got my vision blurry
Ballin' like Stephen Curry, gold fangs in my mouth so purty
Trippie bring demolition and I ain't talking no derbies
Absorb your flow like I'm Kirby, the lies you tell will not hurt me
Try to reach for the stars if people don't get too far
They want all of the money, all the expensive cars
It's few people that ever make it but yet I still gotta go hard
A lot of artists that make it are evil, hearts black as tar, yeah
Okay and this for every rapper that had a shot at sending me
Your efforts ain't getting you anywhere in this industry
Lyrically demonically dominate your flow endlessly
My venomous rhymes wine and dine on you mentally
Motivated the motivations, said got too much chemistry
Fatality, like Liu Kang, told me to finish him
Even the Hulk couldn't take this much intensity
I'm the bullet in the barrel in the gun that shot Kennedy
Mind is racing 'bout hating, contemplation with Haitians
Jamaicans sitting on 5G pacing, back and forth waiting in Dayton
You get the picture, don't take this
Boy this life is real, you couldn't fake this, throw it up, regurgitation
Can't shit on me, you constipated
Is you mad cause we do this on a daily basis?
Yeah, or is you mad cause we made it?
Every day faded, we out here paper chasing bitch, ahh
Ayy, ahh, ayy, ahh, ayy
Can you rap like me? Huh
Ayy, ahh, ayy, ahh, ayy, ahh
Can you rap like me?

[Outro]

When I'm goin' through some things, baby, fill up my cup (just fill it up)
Please just leave me alone, I want to be in my zone (zone)
In the studio late night, I don't even pick up my phone (I ain't pickin' up shit)
Pullin' up to the crib, paranoid one in the dome (maybe shooters in the bushes)
Spinnin' the block two times, make sure you don't follow me home (don't follow me niggas)
Politickin' on a ticket, me and my niggas tryna get it (tryna get it)

[Verse 2: Chris King]
They don't know that I'm strange enough, to play with guns
The stainless ones, when cops come put your bangers up
Your favorite model paid to fuck, you roll your own
They lacing yours with angel dust
Spray 'em up, you say too much
Graveyard shift, a nigga he late too much
Pull the pin from a hand grenade and feed it to him
Looking like he ate too much, God damn
Slime bucket on your snotty nose
Clique kick, left his body froze
Seventeen inside the boot
Like my nigga's off of Hollygrove
Fuck my blunt, I never got it rolled
You a walking lick and you a pot of gold
I be sippin' on lean till my body fold
Fucking with rock is my hobby though
Put your body where nobody knows
You owing me, [?]
Come out you fuckboy, what you hidin' for
Your funeral, soon [?], vamanos
She give me good head like a honor roll
And I got some good weed that I'ma roll
I am a king you should honor most
Stick to the script they didn't get a code
Sippin' on Wock, but you know we don't run out of Tech
Rocking Air Force 1's while gripping the TEC, that's a Nike Tec
Phoneline tapped, feds love to intercept
Hanging with the real right, get hit with the left
If you come disrespect

[Hook: Trippie Redd]
We need some people that'd kill for us
We need some people that'd die for us
We need some bitches that's gon' ride for us
Because this shit is so dangerous
This life I'm livin's so dangerous
The people around me so dangerous
The drugs around me so dangerous
This money on me so dangerous

Boolin in a bitches life
Doin' shit that give me life
Throwing dick like a strike
Pink pants, white shirt
Pink xans, white percs
Pink sands, white dirt
Mink pants, nice fur
Thought fast not first
Hard times light work
Every heart might jerk
Cold hearted, iceburg
Paul Wall slow mo, sip a four need four more
Smoke the whole weed in 24, I'mma pour pour pour soul
More more rain flow, black Rolls just cruise
No umbrella, no coupe, [?]

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]

Everything I touch gets to ruining

Tears fallin' down on my window

 [Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I just spent 80 on a AP
Tell lil' baby she can love me or she hate me
In the brand new McLaren, and I'm racing
With the gang and you know they high as space be

[Chorus]
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
Love it or you hate it, how you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?

[Verse]
How you like the glis'? How you like my wrist?
How you like these diamonds dancing in my fucking fist?
How you like that, how you like that?
If she hit my jack, I hit her right back
'Cause I'm out the way, bitch I'm MIA
Don't stand in my way, posted in the A
Find out where you lay, open up the gates
I won't leave a trace, not try'na catch a case, yeah
You's a open mind, you's a big stain, yeah
You's a poopy butt, yeah you's a shit stain, yeah
Posted in the bando with the big gang, yeah
Totin' sticks and extendos with the big bang, yeah
Uh, all headshots, I won't make your body count
With the big chop, try'na see your body bounce
Pack o' lions, I ain't try'na see nobody pounce
Got a kilo round my neck, we weigh it by the pound, yeah

[Bridge]
You can't see me, you can't be me
Did you get that? Did you get that?
Did you like that? How you like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just spent 80 on a AP
Tell lil' baby she can love me or she hate me
In the brand new McLaren, and I'm racing
With the gang and you know they high as space be

[Chorus]
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?
Love it or you hate it, how you like that, uh?
How you like that, uh? How you like that, uh?




 [Verse 1]
Uh, take a vivid picture, no photos
Implement that shit into your mind, just so you know though
Sucka free living, I'ma say that that's the motto
So for any nigga on that sucka shit, I'm no hoe bro
Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo
Got me bicken back being bool, Quasimoto
All about my paper gotta get my fucking dough hoe
Always on the fucking go-go, you a bitch like Tony Romo
Niggas came around now they extinct like Dodos
Meanwhile I'm in New York fucking up SoHo
Just bagged a new chick, Caroline, nickname Coco
Took her to the telly now lil' baby going loco
She just give me face, ain't no fucking that's a no-no
And she going 30 early dirty no soap though
I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though
And I'm screaming fuck 12, all these foul ass po-po (yeah uh)

[Chorus]
But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm

[Verse 2]
You see I can't ignore it
And you niggas don't see it's in your brain to snore
And you sleep on me until you can't no more
And don't fake on me and try to play the boy
I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me
Or why they feel like my intention's something ugly
Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me
Or why I feel like everyone just saying fuck me
Or why I feel like the opposition gon' buss me
If I gave you my heart, would you still love me?
Lately baby I feel like nobody trust me
Is it just me?
Yeah (hold up)

[Chorus]
But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm

Bet they won't find me like Nemo, yeah
Takin' that bitch straight to Mickey D's (for real)

Might get the murder, it's tempting (for real)
Will everybody remember me? (yeah)

That shit, it just fill up my entity (yeah)
Made me just feel like my enemy (yeah)

 [Intro]
Yuh

(Laughing)
14, yuh
Ooh

[Verse]
Ooh, nowadays I really miss my fucking idols
So that's the title, I grab a Bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit did me like a cycle
Bodies and piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while I start making it rainstorm
You see I can't ignore it
You niggas gon' see it's in your brain snoring
And you sleep on me until you can't no more
'Til you can't no more

[Bridge]
Haha, yeah, aye
Wake up I got my cake up, I need to rake up
I'm your savior, niggas ain't tough
And you can't buck, and you won't bust
And it's Trippie Redd bitch, I won't get touched

[Outro]
In my Gucci coat
In my Gucci loafs, I got Gucci clothes
Aye, that's, that's all for today

Today, today, today

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Ooh, told the hoe to suck my dick, girl don't let go
Yesterday I didn't know, but now I know
So, yes I guess that was me with your hoe
Try to run up on me then I leave you six below
Low, drop lower than a limbo
Whoa, stomp that pussy nigga out in my Timbo's
Ooh, I am not from here I landed here in UFO's
Smokin' gas and blowin' O's
She, suck on that dick 'til she lose control
Hoe, you can't control me, do I look like a remote? (bitch)
Big drank you know I like sippin' fours
I like how you think, makin' you come share that dome

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't know you I just got into your shit today

Diamonds 'round my neck I let the ice bling
Bitches chasin' nuts, bitch, this ain't Ice Age
Ooh, run up on me let my pipe bang, yeah
Ooh, aye, lookin' like a mill

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't know you I just got into your shit today

 Uh, take a vivid picture, no photos
Implement that shit in to your mind just so you know though
Sucker free living, I'm a say that that's the motto
So for any nigga on that sucker shit, I'm no hoe, bro
Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo
Got me bicken back being bool, Quasimodo
All about my paper, got to get my fucking dough, hoe
Always on the fucking go go, you a bitch like Tony Romo
Niggas came around, now they extinct like Dodos
Meanwhile I'm in New York fucking up SoHo
Just bagged a new chick, Caroline, nicknamed Coco
Took her to the telly, now little baby going loco
She just give me face, ain't no fucking, that's a no no
And she going thirty early, dirty no soap though
I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though
And I'm screaming "Fuck 12," all these foul ass po-po
Yeah, uh, but nowadays I really miss my fucking idols
So that's the title, I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs and
Get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain, storm
You see, I can't ignore, and you niggas don't see it's in your brain
And snore, and you sleep on me until you can't no more and
Don't fake on me and try to play the boy
I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me
Or why they feel like my intentions something ugly
Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me
Or why I feel like everyone just saying "Fuck me"
Or why I feel like the opposition gon' bust me
If I gave you my heart, would you still love me?
Lately, baby I feel like nobody trust me, is it just me?




 14 know what the fuck going on
Yeah aye
Ooh
Said I made your hoe
You must be mad that I ain't your hoe
Same reason that I hate your hoe
I'm a spend this money and erase a hoe
Do the dash in this race, you hoe
Got the pistol whip on me when I face you hoe
Do this shit with grace you hoe
