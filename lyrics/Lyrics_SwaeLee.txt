Damn her hair standin' up
She just wanna party though
She heard we be blowin' money
Turn it into particles
When we hit the fuckin' city
We gon' make the articles
Yeah, yeah
Catch me veerin' in the median
I'm in that brand new ghost
When I pull up to the club
You know the hoes gon' touch their toes
Countin' bills, fuckin' hoes simultaneous
That girl so spontaneous
And she give me cranium
I might pull up with a DVD
And DVD your ho
Catch me flyin' down the median
I'm blowin' fuckin' smoke
I might blow it out the gas
Means I'm blowin' out my nose
Yeah you know I let that money talk
That paper fuckin' spoke
Ayy, drop top Vipers, we get all our food to go
I might take the top up off that bitch
And put it on the floor
You can't see me in the spot
I'm higher than a UFO
I got bitches out in London
And got hoes in Tokyo, let's go

Every dog has his day
Sick 'em, sick 'em
Lil' nigga you can hate
Jig 'em, jig 'em
Hundred G's on the table
Flip 'em, flip 'em
Everybody ain't able
Drill 'em, drill 'em
Got a duplex with a crazy view
Throw the cash up, make her hula hoop
Pinkie ring on igloo
Backwoods crushin' grapefruit juice
Pull a 60 out the pouch like a kangaroo

Told y'all I wasn't fuckin' playin'
Say you love me, bitch, say it don't spray it
Blow the 50s layer by layer, yeah

Snuck backstage with no wristband
Tryna ride me like [?]
[?] tap dance
[?] middle man
Light head on my waist
Yeah I got good taste
I've been livin' on the edge
So I can't play it safe
Take a reality check
All of my niggas [?]
[?] jumbo jet




 Ho ho ho
I don't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Ho ho ho oh oh
You're not under my mistletoe
Ho ho ho ho ho
The weather outside is cold
I don't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Ho ho ho ho woah
The weather outside is cold




 So strong, So strong, who's taking you home ...?
Are you kidding me talking about quality ...
Must've felt good to be up in the lies
Trusting your gut, you better trust your right mind
....
Feel the orderly life
I expect you to look me dead in the eye

If you wanted to be mine then you should've saw me first
We could've gone from there
Gone from there
Gone from there




 [Intro]
Uh, uh
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
How it feels

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills (ayy)
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels

[Verse]
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel
You're still a bad girl after all these years
Yo, didn't I give you the NyQuil?
So you're on home base and I'ma steal
I picked you up, your chest like the Man of Steel
I might just save that girl like the Man of Steel
I might just pull up on stainless steel
Don't gotta question, 'cause I know she will
Only someone involved can stay the night until (ooh)
But I think we both know how it feels (ooh, yeah)
This morning when we took shots and cheered
You just realized that you had somethin' real (ooh)
But I'm the one that don't know how to deal
I'ma a-a-always seal the deal
I'ma womp, womp, womp then seal the deal
With them diamonds that you can see from here
If they aren't A-list, just leave 'em there
'Cause you'll be hearing about us everywhere
When the squad roll up, they couldn't help but stare
Ayy, I'ma just sit that there
She got a ass, she gon' just sit it right there
I like a bad bitch when she long hair, no care
I won't ever go on no cab
I said, "You wanna take a shot?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Other niggas over there disrespect, yeah
I say, "You tryna be down?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Off the drink, baby, I'm a wreck, yeah
In the backseat, when I get the neck, yeah
Got me runnin' to you for some sex, yeah
But for one night, don't know how to feel
About a heartbreak story in Encino Hills

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel




 [Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey
Chopsquad
Ooh
In the heat of the moment, I know I can...
Yeah
DJ the beast on this banger!

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 1]
It's no suggestion comin' from me, I'm just somebody that cares
And you can front like you don't feel me, you most definitely care
And if there's some kinda hold on your love or your heart then baby, why lie?
You're killin' me like a homicide, needin' more excitement for your double life
Here's the drugs for your sore eyes, from friends that are hard to come by
Let's just hope that my phones don't die, so you can reach me
I know I'm changin' for sure, lay in the lowest of love
And you saw me transform and there was no cure

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 2]
I wonder sometimes, if the one that's passed me by
I wonder sometimes, if somebody's lovin' you right
Table's turned all of a sudden, ridin' by my side, like on a trollie
Father, God, they want my money, heart on fire, they never could crush it
Twisting up my dialogue, sorry, but I'm wide-wide eye buggin'
Something else you need from me but would you even take a bullet?
Let me buy your time even though I wiped off your kiss
And I shouldn't say too much because it's what I do that really sinks in

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself




 [Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I can feel the weight of what you say (ooh, ooh)
I had explanations for days (ooh, ooh)
Don't think you're the only one that's sane
It seems like we're not on the same page
All I do is think when I'm away (when I'm away)
Colors burst and all I see are shapes (hey!)
Sun goes away and that's when I call your name (your name)
She's here for good, and I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 2]
She said the E was for missin' my embrace (yeah, oh-oh)
So yeah, I feel so out of place (woo, oh yeah)
I was meant to love and protect you
You know what's on my mind, but not what's in my heart
Give me someone to connect to (to)
Because these drinks are hitting me a little hard

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ah, ooh, yeah
It shouldn't hurt to look your way
It shouldn't hurt
It shouldn't hurt to look your way
It shouldn't hurt, it shouldn't hurt
Let me fuck with it real quick

I'm turnin' her world upside down
Give a motherfuck when these drugs in my system




 [Verse 1]
Winter's over, let the sun in
Wife-beater on me, let's pour the rum
Wife-beater on me, I'll take you on
I'm the closest and you're shinin' like a summer solstice
Everyone's tryna figure you out
On the patio and we're just strung out
And I know what you're into
Fortune tellers couldn't tell you what to do
If I seem like I'm bad news

[Chorus]
Then hide from me, girl
I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria
I'm fuckin' takin' you serious
Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl)
In love, no typical love
I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run

[Verse 2]
Tan Jeep out front with the Rollie on
Nine deep and we've been away from home too long
I'ma make your bitch choose
Five liters in the cooler
Five liters in the cooler
You can pose with your poodle
Drive fast in your new car
Drive fast in your new car
I'ma give you that bling
Kiss the big face that I love dearly
That nigga ain't near as cool as me
Hate with all your might, I'm coolin', b
And I'm sure you've never had this experience before
Helicopter on the roof, let's soar
And I'm out on the west like Schwartz
Niggas fuckin' up the golf course
So that's what rich niggas are doin' these days
Yeah we get money like 10, 12 ways
And on a restless night
She gon' take me where I need to go
In the backseat of the Maybach, where we used to get on
And you want real love
One that'll make you feel like you just woke up

[Chorus]
I think you better hide from me, girl
I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria
I'm fuckin' takin' you serious
Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl)
In love, no typical love
I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run




 [Intro: Young Thug]
Ear Drummers
They think it's woman inside me
'Cause the way I wear my tees and my jeans, ayy

Little do they know they women (Don't play with me)
Got marks all over her knees, ayy
(Maserati)

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Rollin' off you
Rollin' off you, you overdosin' off my kiss
And the joke is on you
Joke is on you if you fall for that other nigga, hey!

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Young Thug]
I took a trip offshore (ayy)
Took the whip offshore (yeah)
I took a chick offshore
You should get out more (hey, hey)
And you should get out more, you should get out more
Baby, take a lil' tour (oh)
When we hit that floor, all the money downpour
That's what it's here for (that's what it's for)
Do it up so large, do it up so large, like a breakout star
Bunch of young niggas on a crash course (do it large, do it large)
Going overboard, going overboard, we can hit that store
Yeah and take it too far (ayy)

[Verse: Young Thug]
I'ma let you vibe all day
I don't mind if you try it all day
You know Thugger let you ride all day
Yeah, let you ride all day
You can go get what you like all day
It feels wrong but it's right, no, baby
Perky got me lookin' at your body all day
And it feels right, my baby, yeah
Baby steps when you walk
You got baby steps when you walk
High heels on your feet when you walk
High heels on your feet, baby
Lambo, them legs ajar, yeah
And a Maserati truck, the doors in the back ajar
Let's get it on, baby
Make your mouth get it, get it gone, yeah
Like a motorcycle, get it on, baby
Yeah, perform foreplay
So in love, I can buy the bitch a ring every day
Stop this rap shit, turn to a mob any day
Bossman, I could get homie dropped any day
I'll slap the shit out Donald Trump any day
Brand new assistant I like, any day
Better get it right if you don't want gunplay
I'ma do it right and fill up the driveway
Bentley on the side and it's sittin' on LeBron James
911 Porsche got me takin' you on a date, ayy
Pistol Pete mobbin', I'm bangin' it all day
Baddest and the baddest and the baddest like all day
I ran up the millions, I did it all my way
Hundred dollar bills and I like 'em all straight
Real talk, I'm a neat freak
And lil' mama fold my clothes like a neat freak
You say you doin' somethin', ya uncle reading right through your wrong
Hoes can't talk when I talk where I'm from
32 pumps make 'em run, Forrest, run
Monte Carlo, poppin' my collar
Wrestle that ho like The Mothafuckin' Rock
I say wrestle that ho like The Mothafuckin' Rock
So I let it freeze up
Eat the cake, got amazing cake
These bitches hatin', they throw rice by the case
I'm ridin' down Memory Lane
Catchin' feelings like I'm Walter Payton
I just wanna throw love at this evenin'
Christian Dior with the ski
Bad bitch, yeah, make believe
Barney Balmain on my jeans
Bleedin' like a Tampax Pearl
Mistake, let it rain on your world, ayy
Your diamonds, yeah, they wet like the bottom of the shore, yeah
Better stop playin', say you quick like sand, oh my God

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I took a trip offshore
Took the whip offshore (yeah)
I took a chick offshore
You should get out more (hey, hey)
And you should get out more, you should get out more
Baby, take a lil' tour
When we hit that floor, all the money downpour
That's what it's here for
Do it up so large, do it up so large, like a breakout star
Bunch of young niggas on a crash course
Going overboard, going overboard, we can hit that store
Yeah and take it too far




 [Verse 1]
Don't you run away (hol' up)
I caught you on a wave (yeah)
I'm not tryna follow the blind
And you not tryna be left behind
It takes more than two shots (ooh)
To wipe my memory clean
And I was bustin' in blocks
Just to hear you sing (oh, oh, oh, girl)

[Chorus]
Good girl (hey), I'll see you in the daytime
I'm just too lit for white wine (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Good girl (hey), I'll see you in the daytime
I'm just too lit for red wine (lit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (uh huh)

[Verse 2]
You wanted to go down in this place
This good gas has me in a good space
Between the money and the women
I wake up still in a daze
Daze, daze
No roleplay
Can't roleplay
Oh, yeah
Enjoy your trip
Just be you and I'll be all that I can be
This love got you borderline crazy
I crashed on your shore, oh
And now let's move forward

'Cause you could taken

I got game, but I don't play




 [Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?

[Verse]
Just dunked a girl in the pool
There's plenty room in my SUV when I'm on the avenue
Rich bitch, I'm on to you
If it's mine, it ain't up for grabs
I make 'em pay me in cash
If the last didn't last
It's 'cause they didn't love you like they should have
So I'll get you from the train station
Know you don't mind, so I'll have the tree waitin'
If it's on my mind then it's on yours too
I'll make the first move and I guarantee you'll call me back, yeah
Cupid got a bounty on me (on me)
Trouble done found you
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (ooh)
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (yeah)
And I was homesick these past Februaries
Runnin' around hopin' payback was sweet
Money up, now we really flexin'
I take it out of park like

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations

 [Verse 1: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
You don't gotta search hard to find me
With the money is where I'll be
With the cash, yeah, that's where I'll be
Give it up, baby, no stopping

[Chorus: Wizkid]
My gyal
You bad, You bad
But mi no want this forever
Oh yeah
My gyal, you bad, you bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever
Ooh yeah

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Would you leave with me tonight?
Get high, get fucked with me tonight?
I don't want this thing for life
My gyal come rock with me tonight

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I can provide the good vibe
I keep a hot one by my side
And if you choose then you better chose wisely
Me not coming in clutch is unlikely
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing
Girl, what you got for me?
What you got for me?
I love you long time, that's a guarantee
I switch time zones just to come see
I got your mind blown, yeah, easy
Don't want to fall, just want to taste
Tell me yes, don't reply maybe
Why we gotta do so much talking?
I'm tryna make it through the crowd, baby

[Chorus: Wizkid]
You bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever
Forever

[Verse 3: Swae Lee (& Wizkid)]
You know what your body wants to do
Why you gotta think this through (ooh yeah)
You fucking with the midnight crew
Playing your favorite tunes
You tryna find that feel from way back when
I'm speeding with the roof caved in
You can say that somebody's out to get ya
I'm for real, ain't nobody filthy richer
Give me that look one more time, baby
Yeah, It's over
I got the Colorado pack, it's over
Yeah, yeah
I make time for what I want
Meet me back at the room
Since you're in the mood
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing...

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Drug me
I'm smoking, blowing Os, and feeling stars
Getting so high off my supply
I do it so easy, I don't try
Can't you see yourself with me tonight?
I don't want to hurt you, fuss, and fight
I'm gon' do you make you close your eyes
All in favor, please say I
Call your job and tell them you'll be late

What's in these drinks I spilled?
Baby, don't tell me no lie

What's in this cup for real? (For real?)

Drivin' me while I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come near (come near)
But my eyes criss and cross and I'm already gone and it's not hard to see (to see)
Plus that over-the-counter was put to good use, yeah, that's just what I did
I could tell she ready when she came up out her shirt and she laid up on me
Do what you feel and I feel what you say and I see what you mean

[Chorus]
What's in this cup for real? What's in this cup for real?
Was this chick for real? Was this bitch for real?

I already told you, you already froze up, I am really frozen
I already told you, I already rolled up
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?

What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)

[Outro]
What's in these drinks I spilled? Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this, drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out
