 [Chorus: Lil Baby]
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
My lil one just caught him a homi, I gave his lawyer a hundred
We used to grind every summer, we used to peel us a hundred
Now we can do what we wanna
I might go cop me a Hummer, I don't know nothin' but money, but I'ma keep me a burner
Had the block hot as a sauna, in the middle of the winter
I took them trips to go get it
I used to serve out a rental, all of my niggas they with it
Me and my niggas gon' get it, I had to make a decision
Fuck with these bitches or get to these riches
You know me, I went and ran up them digits
Used to be wishing, that shit turned to winning
Damn that shit crazy, it's just the beginning
Hopped out the Hellcat, the clip was extended
4 Pockets Full and I know it look temptin'
Nigga try me I'ma shoot 'til it's empty
The money I made it, I guess it's just in me
They don't really wanna go to war with us
I'ma spend all of my money on bullets
I'ma make them press the issue the fullest
Came out the jungle, it made me a gorilla
I'm gon' be one of the realest

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide
Everybody gotta get it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it
I hear 'em screamin' they down to ride
When it's time to slide they ain't with it

[Verse 2: Skull-E]
I cannot work me no nine to five, no
That's just some shit I can't do
Lil Baby what it do?
Ayy yo, took the birds up out the coupe
Fuck these bitches by the two, that's just the way that we do it
Everything we do exclusive, we just not talkin' the music
Dot on your head like a Buddhist, ayy yeah
You cannot stop with us and the beat, that's why these pussy niggas hatin' on me
Pop a perc and fuck that bitch back to sleep
Never trust these hoes 'cause these bitches freaks
We the new wave, fuck up the beach
I'm the ruler, nigga don't mention me
And you niggas snitching, I don't fuck with police
And we politicking, handle beef in the street
No one said it would be easy, ayy yo
I thought you would ride for me, how could you mislead me?
Now we goin' up when niggas throw up plummet
I remember nights when I ain't had nothin'
Benihana plate all in my stomach
I just left the mall, I spent me a hundred

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I cannot work me no nine to five
I ran up them racks for a living
Try me, it's gon' be a homicide

I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber (slip in that)
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]

Here go the bricks, where the money at?
Give me a load, I ain't comin' back
I make 'em shoot where your stomach at
We gon' pull up where your mama at
Runnin' through hoes like a running back
We can fuck but you can't call this number back
If you knew better, baby you'd do better
I got plenty hoes, call me Hugh Hefner

I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
If I said fuck you I meant that
I'm whippin' this coupe, I ain't rent that
The shit that you savin', I spent that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs on me
I just went bonkers all up, Exclusive Game
Fly as fuck like a dove on me
Diamonds wet like a tub on me
Hurricane Harvey, flood on me
Left the spot with a dub on me
Walk in the spot, bitches tug on me

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & Lil Baby]
I can't be totin' no handguns

I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my kush be muddy
I just came home with nothin'

Hey, now I'm up all of the sudden, hey

 [Chorus: Lil Baby & Marlo]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the slums, niggas knowin' how we come
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the bricks where we ain't have shit
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Marlo]
Back when G-Dog caught his time 'cause he wouldn't drop a dime
Back when Big Fred died, had the whole hood cryin'
OG Troup lost his life in his own hood
Niggas steady walkin' 'round like it's all good
Tiger T got crossed by his own man
I seen him and 8-Ball count a hundred bands
Remember Spencer killed a nigga with his bare hands
Meatball turned rat on his own fam
Him and Jordan lil' one got killed at the same time
Every time I close my eyes that shit on my mind
What you know about doin' a paper for some paper
You niggas can't relate 'cause you ain't never ran around in that

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Marlo]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the slums, niggas knowin' how we come
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the bricks where we ain't have shit
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Marlo]
Rest in peace to Shawty Lo, yeah dey know
Back when he was comin' through the bricks in an orange Monte Carlo
Mario got shot, that's still some bullshit
Remember NuNu got hit with a whole clip
You niggas ain't from my side, they must be two-sided
They sayin' C-Dog turned in the whole west side
You niggas never was there
I remember neighborhood fights all at the fair
When micros was the only thing that girls would wear
Then these bitches started puttin' the kink and twist in their hair
True Religion was the shit, hood days spend your last on an outfit
They say Keen and Big been rich

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Marlo]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the slums, niggas knowin' how we come
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A, that's where I'm from
I'm from the bricks where we ain't have shit
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town
This that real A-Town, yeah this that real A-Town

Jeans expensive they fitting me tight

You can go with us too if you like
I'm on top and I'm hot it feel nice
Fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
Diamonds hitting who cut off the lights
In the clouds we balling like Mike

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Soon as I get my money I'm gon blow it
Fuck that, I'ma take mine and put it up
I got some foreign baddies in my DM they hitting me up
They trying to get on the plane today and come eat me up
She had the fyest brain that I ever had
I gave her everything that I never had
I'm going next level on some more shit
These niggas dead broke on some hoe shit
Running that money up til I get tired
He said I wouldn't make it he lied

She looked at my side like 'Who is that guy?'
That's my lil brother G5
They call him Steven, I call him Curry
That nigga shoot out your eye

(Yeah, what'd you do? How'd you do it?)
Soon as I got my money I ran through it
(I fucked up some commas)
I couldn't believe I saved some, I thought I blew it
(I thought it was all gone)
I just downed a whole pint, I'm under the influence
Then I popped an Adderall to give me endurance
I'm up I cannot get tired, your bitch on molly she wired
Tossed her with Moneybagg Myers
Plenty chains, clang clang, 50k plain Jane
Go get some money quit saying you can't
They thought I was born in the vault of the bank

 [Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Still poppin' Percocet
Drankin' lean too
Shit I gotta deal with

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Verse 1]
Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know when we pulled up, everybody hopped out firin'
I remember on the way back, everybody in the car quiet
I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide, homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up, told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn, "we just caught a body"
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga, I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did
Gotta be here for my kid, gotta watch my son get big
Everything I say is no lie, I'm just glad the kid didn't die

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me

I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Verse 2]
All I see is young niggas on Instagram with them sticks
I never post no gun, but when it's smoke I bet I send a blitz
That bullshit that you on thinkin' cool get you a 100 years
I bet yo partner fuck yo bitch, I bet you don't hear nothin' from the clique
I ain't gon' tell you no lie, this shit'll make a grown man cry
Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives
Hear a nigga sharpen 'em at night
Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot
Everyday a nigga get knocked
Search team turn to the narcs, man this shit can really get hard

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me

 [Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck them all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I made a hunnid in two days
Neighbour trippin' cause I keep the door swangin'
I drop a mixtape today, they gon' be thinking I got me a ghostwriter
AMG on the floor like a low rider
Having rich arguments my whole problem
Running money up I don't see nobody
Buying lawyers for both of the [?]
Tennis chains on fleek, I could wear a new piece every week
Me and my diamonds all on pee, point
Ask about me, I dug deep for 'em
Hit the bitch Curry, three-point
I can't hit them all so I Pikachu
I don't text 'em I just stick and move
Fresh pair of Loubs

[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck them all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Forty pointers that's a waffle cart
Ice cubes on my neck like my styrofoam
Drip, dripping like that it's the shower on
Them ain't real, them diamonds are rhinestones
I'm straight I got the iron now
Too many hoes bought another phone
I apologise, AP honeycomb
Shorty walking round with like three hunnid on
Baby vanilla, my rose gold match the Gucci with rose petal
Trapper of the year I need a gold medal
You know the water make the pussy get wetter
Ooh, can't name a nigga that do it better
I got too many hoes like I'm Hugh Hefner
Different foreign bitches, I'ma put 'em together
Yeah they know I'm a trendsetter

[Hook: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck them all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall

 [Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
4 Pockets Full, nigga

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain’t my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck

Don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you a hour

[Verse 1]
And they know I'ma GOAT
I got paper and power
Man, these niggas some hoes
Everything they say sour
I bought a Bentley and blew out her brain
Since I got money and people done changed
I'm keepin' my .40, I'm up on my aim
Jump out of line, I bust at your brain
Shoebox money, it ain't nothin' to me
I could make a hunnid in my sleep
These niggas cappin', that's all they see
They just wanna be like me
Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad, I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him
'Til I stayed down and ran up an M
Baby ballin', they should put it on film
Shootin' for bricks, I don't aim for the rim
Fuck the gym, I don't work out
Take a sip of the lean, wash the Perc down
I got on all my jewels, foreign, and all my shoes
These niggas mad 'cause I won't lose
I gotta win, I just began
No fake love, no fake friends
Just 30 in this FN

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain’t my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head

Hey, your friends at the door

[Verse 2]
I go deep in her throat
Keep that shit on the low
Don't nobody else know
That's our business fasho
We can fuck on the counter
I keep takin' these downers
Pop me a Addi, a Percocet, pour me a four
Baby, we grown, we could fuck on the floor
I'm gettin' money
That's why they mad
That ain't my fault
Nigga, I'm a boss
Get white chalked
Playin' with an OG
I got bags
These niggas owe me, they know me
Standin' in the kitchen and workin' my wrists
I made a duece, turned to a nick
I make a nick, turned to a nine
I made  a nine, turned to a split
You know the rest, I made a split, turned to a brick
We in this bitch, we got it lit
We got them sticks

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain’t my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck

Don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower

 [Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)

I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
Young niggas really paved the way
Pussy nigga tryna ride the wave
Young nigga want a bankroll
Try me, I'ma break a nigga, woah

Nigga ain't lettin' shit slide
Tiger told me fuck it, let 'em ride
Told me fuck it, go and spend a block

You can't pull up in lil Cali, it ain't safe out here
Keep some shooters with me, they keep K's on them
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, tryna break the rim
Quarter million dollars on me

Still screamin' fuck the police
Nigga ain't gettin' shit from me

[Verse 2]
Look out for my people
Sellin' all this reefer
Servin' like it's legal
Pull up in the Regal
Went to school to fuck the teachers
Shooting shots from the bleachers
These niggas didn't believe me
I had to show 'em, made 'em see me
Pull up full pockets for a thigh pad
I got all these niggas big mad
Bitches tryna get some get back
Lil bitty bitch get back
Nigga's bitches riding pom poms
My lil niggas goin' straight dumb
I ain't Lil Weezy but a hot boy
I can't wait to smash on a call call
These niggas sweet like poptarts
Drive the Hellcat like a hotbox
Party real hard, I'm a rockstar
Rudy in the cut, he a top shotter
If I send the word you a done dada
These niggas broke, got no dollars
I'ma run the money up, no problem
I don't give a fuck about nobody

[Chorus]
I don't go on dates, I can't wait, I fuck first day, yeah

 [Chorus]
I know times get hard but it's gon' pay off, it's gon' pay off
Grinding every day, can't take no days off, no days off
Ridin' 'round the city in a brand new coupe
I got a brand new coupe
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new jewels
I got a bad bitch too

[Verse 1]
Run the money up, can't take no days off
Bitch I'm my own boss, I can't get laid off
Try me, them youngins will take your face off
Try me, them youngins will take your face off
Grindin' every day, I had to get it, had to work with what I had
I went and ran me up a bag
I got these pussy niggas mad
But I ain't doin' shit
Two door coupe, yeah the fast one
Hopped out in the brand new latest fashion
I know they can't stand that lil rich bastard
I'm gon' show my ass, I never had shit
I think I'm a junkie, I need rehab, I'm addicted to the lean
I went and get it with my team
Twenty-thousand on some rings
I bought my bitch a new Celine

[Chorus]
I know times get hard but it's gon' pay off, it's gon' pay off
Grinding every day, can't take no days off, no days off
Ridin' 'round the city in a brand new coupe
I got a brand new coupe
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new jewels
I got a bad bitch too

[Verse 2]
Savage for the money, goin' hard for my kid
Sometimes I had nightmares 'bout the shit that we did
I come from the jungle, you can't live where I lived
Police they was on me, glad I hid where I hid
Can't sell dope forever, get the money and quit
Then go get the money, turn the money legit
Two four-fives, that's a hard nine
Stayed down for the pay out, now it's my time
I got out of prison at the perfect time
Got out, I was fucked up, bid gave me a dime
Now I got the money, kickin' shit in the sky
Now I got the money, kickin' shit in the sky

[Chorus]
I know times get hard but it's gon' pay off, it's gon' pay off
Grinding every day, can't take no days off, no days off
Ridin' 'round the city in a brand new coupe
I got a brand new coupe
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new jewels
I got a bad bitch too




 [Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
I know they ain't feelin' my pain
I got codeine inside my veins, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 1]
They offerin' the shooter the death penalty, won't tell on me
I know if I go broke today, them same hoes gon' bail on me
I got them throwin' salt, they steady tryna fuck up my recipe
Amiri jeans, a hundred a pair, ain't nothin' about a nigga cheap
Sellin' weed in the projects, relapsed on the Hi-Tech
Told the gang that we up next, put 'em on a G5 jet
Overseas with my sidepiece, my queen, she gotta be a dimepiece
We gon' stick together like assigned seats, on that Dej Loaf, nigga, try me
Whoever thought I'd put a hundred on my neck?
Whoever thought that I'd say I'm the one up next?
Whoever thought they'd ever consider me the best?
Whoever thought, whoever thought, whoever thought?

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 2]
Go and ask about me in the streets, they heard of me
If she find out I been creepin', she gon' murder me
I ain't trippin', no complaints, I got my currency up
Out of town, I let the windows down so they can see us
I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (That's all I know)
I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (Give me her soul)
I got 'em hatin', they throwin' shots, they on their toes
One thing they know (One thing they know)
One thing they know (One thing they know)
Ain't gon let up on them niggas, once you try us, ain't gon' stop
If it's pressure, let me know, so we can pull up with them Glocks
Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block
How you gon wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (No help)
I put the food on the table, nigga was hungry, I tried to feed you
Treat all my niggas like bosses, nobody better, everyone equal (Yeah)
Real talk this the sequel, hold it down for my people

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'

[Verse 1]
I used to trap out the store
I ain't have nowhere to go

Payin' J's to watch out for the folks
Hit the stick like I'm playin' Madden
Should I do it, nigga couldn't imagine
Skippa Da Flippa, young nigga havin'
I get the money, I don't do no dabbin'
Maison Margiella on Monday, I rock Givenchy on Tuesday
Wednesday I rock Ferragamo, Thursday I'm wearing my Louis
Friday I come out in Fendi, I got bitches tryna do me
Designered down, I be groovin', livin' life like a movie
You can't stand next to me

[Chorus]
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license

Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'

[Verse 2]
Lil nigga but my shirt off
Pull up with the pack and skrt off
Niggas softer than a Nerf ball
I ain't never heard of none y'all
Niggas say they really in the streets
Why I ain't never seen you in the street?
Bitch you can go and ask about me
They'll tell you that I'm really in the streets
I don't give a fuck about making no song
I was standing in the spot, tryna work my phone
Had to do it on my own, lil nigga I'm grown
You can hate from afar just watch your tone
Do anything for them racks
I used to sleep with them roaches and rats
They tellin' me I should rap
I'm tryna get off this pack

[Chorus]
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'
Jump off the jump rope, I'm tryna dive in
Quarter million dollars all on my skin
Tote this F&N like I got license
Fuck stop signs and red lights, I don't do no stoppin'




 [Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you gon' check the forecast if it is gon' rain

So I had to go coupe, no brain
Ain't worried 'bout you
I'ma do what I do and I do my thing
When your wrist like this, you gon' check the forecast if it is gon' rain
Made a brick through a brick

[Verse]
Got a quarter million dollars in a book bag
I'm a New Era dope boy, no cap
I'm living my best life for real
Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work

Get a opposite knocked off, toe tag

Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Every thing you ever seen me ride in, bought it

[Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you gon' check the forecast if it is gon' rain
Made a brick through a brick
Ain't whip up shit, this pure cocaine

 [Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never though it'd be like this
But now I got the money, so every day we lit

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
By the time I turned 10 I was running wild
Listening to Juvenile
Staying at my grandma house
My mama got put out
I've been through some shit that you would never know
But I keep a smile, I can't let it show
I was 15 Jock and Dee, caught a murder case
Runnin' with the robbers, man I know we upped the murder rates
I was sittin' in jail when Lil' Man got shot in his face
Damn that shit bad, they say that's my neice dad
Brian got killed
That shit crazy
You can't listen once you here
They tried to say we made the hit, but lookahere
I love that nigga like my brother, that's for real
That's for real

[Chorus]
I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never though it'd be like this
But now I got the money, so every day we lit

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
25 cent froze cups in the hood
Me and Tyrone playing nick-a-knock in the bricks up no good
Had a walkie talkie watching for the 12 tryna make a sale
Lil' Joe ain't even kill nobody, but he got life in jail
Perkys get you by
Them youngins knock 'em down
[?] to my phone when you got back in town
They see me on the stage now, though I ain't get a cap and gown
Want me to hit it raw dawg
200 for that pussy, gee baby don't you play hard ball
Lil' Pooh them bring them rods out
Ice on me, can't thaw it out
Fuck this drink might pour it out
Chain look like I'm showing out
Xans, but I ain't goin' out
Sales coming in and out
We just tryna sew the block
Grandma found my stash spot and she tried to throw me out

[Chorus]
I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never though it'd be like this
But now I got the money, so every day we lit

Fifty racks every week off of shows
Movin' cautious like I'm still on parole
I can't fuck with bitches who be doin' the most
Screamin' fuck the system 'til they free all the bros
Shoot a thousand, bet a thousand a roll
If it ain't a thousand, man, that shit ain't no load
Country boys say they lovin' the road
You know me, I'm tryna serve 'em they dope

Earl on the beat

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again

Went to the lot and bought a new Benz

Lost lil Juan in the middle of the summer, that shit was awful nigga
As soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it, we gon' off them nigga

These niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city, it's gon' cost them nigga
Jumped in the game and went got me some millions, no cap
I made a wave for us
Them bitches were fucking with me when I didn't have no money, now they can't wait to fuck
Every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin', that's why they pray for us
I was in the back of the back like Rosa Parks
Me and my dogs on Tec, a four or more
Grind every day like it ain't no tomorrow
I was just broke, ain't going back
I'ma run mines up to the max
I want the cheese, ain't fuckin' with rats
I wanna fuck her I give her a rack
If she don't give me head ain't texting her back
I'm a dog I go deep in the cat
Remember one time I ain't had jack
I had a hunnid I bought me a pack
I took the pack and went got me a bag
It started rolling and coming in fast
I had the old heads hanging back
And I'm rich now and that's why they mad

Putting on for the hood like I'm White Boy Marco or something
Super fast car, super bad broad, everybody know a nigga getting money
Couple homies switched up on me when I blowed up now look at them funny
I put the four on my back with no shirt on
I let the homies get bags for the low low
We sending bricks out the spot this the o-zone
I'm the man, rest in peace Shawty Lo
I take the whole gang on the road
Long way from in front of the store
They don't wanna fly they wanna hit the road
They wanna take pistols to all of my shows
We thuggin' in public wherever we go
I did some shit that don't nobody know

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in

All I ask that you don't blow my phone up

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm in love, I admit it
I know that you think I want to hit it
But baby I ain't got time for no visits
But baby when I get some time we gon' kick it
Baby we gon' live it all the way up
Just stay down for me, I'm on my way up
Them other bitches already done changed up
Baby is you real or you gon' change up?
Fuckin' with a nigga like me dangerous
Would you still be here if I got banged up?
Man I been through that before, they changed up
Now they be like why he actin' famous?
Baby would you ride for a nigga?
Get on top and do the job for a nigga?
If I need you to run to a nigga (would you run?)
Baby tell me you gon' run to a nigga (you better run)
If you need me I'ma come for you baby (here I come, here I come)
I'ma be right there
If you need me I'ma come to you baby (here I come, here I come)
I'ma be right there
Baby why you trippin', I ain't got time for that
I been tryna get it on my grind for that
Told you pull up, you trip, never minding that
I ain't never answer that, I'm twine with that
You say that you gone well then I'm fine with that
I will never trip, I'm never calling back
I can never fall in love with you no more
I done gave you all of that

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you
I be right here for you
Anything that you want I will provide that for you
I provide that for you

[Verse 2]
Forgi's on your whip, I'ma tryna slide on
I been tryna kick it with a rider
Baby I be busy, I be tied up
You ain't gotta love me, just don't lie though
We gon' take them trips 'cause ain't nobody else as fly as us
Baby we gon' let 'em have it
We go where they can't go
Pimpin', where'd my cane go?
I'm the same lil nigga, I ain't changed though
They get salty when I pulled up in that Range Rover
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you
I be right here for you
Anything you needin', I provide that for you
I provide that for you
You know I got hoes, I never put none 'em before you
Never put none 'em before you
Baby you my world and I swear I adore you
And I swear I adore you

[Verse 3]
Late nights, call on the phone
You say where I'm at, I'm on the way
Two hours later you be callin'
Thought you told me you was on the way
Tell you I got caught up, I got busy
But I had another bitch with
Still when I get it there you gon' get it
Soon as I pull up she gon' get it

[Outro]
I ain't got no time for these bitches 'cause I'm on my grind
Baby are you trippin', I been on my grind (I'm grindin')
4PF, you digg?




 [Verse]
Shoutout my label that's me
I'm in this bitch with TP
I'm in this bitch with 4trey
I just poured up me a 8
Real nigga all in my face
500 racks in my safe
500 racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love
What you know 'bout pullin' up, in Bentley trucks
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoe
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom we used to wear each other clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no mo'
Hold it down for the 4
In the 9 with the woes
Marlo my dawg that's for sho'
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain’t gone fallout bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both my ears on froze
I been gettin faded I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball I don't layup
I'm a big boss and I say so
They’ll wipe you down If I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
40's, on 40's, on 40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina shout out New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz Truck
Hop out fresher than a mento
Lil nigga but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh I got 'em mad, my fault
Talking bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these percs I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangsta but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a vert with a uzi
Twelve get behind me I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
Yeah




 [Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay
Yeah yeah
I come from the cook up, that's all I know
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus]
They thinkin' I ain't gettin' no money 'cause I never show it
I'm tryna run me up a whole dime and I'm goin' for it
Fuck I look like takin' chances
Fuck this money, go and blow it
I'm tryna run mine up, I gotta put mine up
Puttin' up the money for lil Jason 'cause he growin' up
I do four shows every week, man I'm blowin' up
Last month I got seven, this month I want ten, I'm goin' up
They tryna stop my shine, but they can't stop my shine

[Verse 1]
I just bought a brand new Rolex
I'm a million dollar nigga, no flex
Stretch these pounds, change my name to Boflex
Hit your baby mama, now your ho next
I want a rose gold on the Patek
I want a regular one, I want it faster
I'm doing numbers, call it mathematics
I had a half a ticket in the attic
It ain't gon' never stop, I'm everlasting
They know how I come, they know how I come
They know how I come
They know how I come before I get there
Cross 'em over, Raf Simmons footwear
Balenciaga runners, these my fifth pair
Ten figure nigga, I'ma get there
Traphouse bunkin', we don't live here
Could've been gone but I'm still here
Pints of Activis, they the real deal
Used to have to rob and I still will

[Chorus]
They thinkin' I ain't gettin' no money 'cause I never show it
I'm tryna run me up a whole dime and I'm goin' for it
Fuck I look like takin' chances
Fuck this money, go and blow it
I'm tryna run mine up, I gotta put mine up
Puttin' up the money for lil Jason 'cause he growin' up
I do four shows every week, man I'm blowin' up
Last month I got seven, this month I want ten, I'm goin' up
They tryna stop my shine, but they can't stop my shine

[Verse 2]
I'm on parole still, got a password
I'm goin' straight net, fuck the backboard
I remember when I used to ask for it
I don't think back, I just press fast forward
I want happiness, I spend my last for it
Two twenty-five read on the dashboard
Cost a quarter mil and I paid cash for it
Poppin' percs, I ain't thinkin' 'bout last
I'm never pissin' dirty, fuck my PO
Lost it all, got me fucked on my re-up
Bitches talkin' down but fuck it 'cause we up
She act crazy I got booed in Korea
Never thought that rappin' would be my career
I'm a trap star and that's what it is
A couple million five, I ain't signing no deal
Nigga out of line, we gon' spray, you get killed
Draco with the drum, hop out and go dumb
I come from the slum, two fingers and a thumb
Nigga know I chunk it up, rep your set and throw it up
Nigga try to take my chain we gon' shoot up the whole club

[Chorus]
They thinkin' I ain't gettin' no money 'cause I never show it
I'm tryna run me up a whole dime and I'm goin' for it
Fuck I look like takin' chances
Fuck this money, go and blow it
I'm tryna run mine up, I gotta put mine up
Puttin' up the money for lil Jason 'cause he growin' up
I do four shows every week, man I'm blowin' up
Last month I got seven, this month I want ten, I'm goin' up
They tryna stop my shine, but they can't stop my shine




 [Intro: Lil Baby]
I got Yogii with me
I got Marlo with me
I got Yogii with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I been in the trenches, I been grindin' tryna get it
Tryna run me up a ticket
Staying on my ten, I ain't got time for you bitches
I been ballin' hard ain't gon' fall off my pivot
I don't play around with these niggas, don't waste time with these niggas
I need mine and I need it for sure
4PF I'm ridin' for them niggas, I'll die for them niggas
Every time you see me throwin' up fours
Sometimes I be tired, I be sleepin'
I ain't gon' lie, I'm an addict
I can't help it, I be pourin' up fours
I just got 'em in, got 'em gone
Got it all off a phone
I think it's time for us to get a new load

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I just killed a couple niggas 'cause they tried me
Playin' with the marbles like fire
They call me lil Marlo, not The Wire
When I get 'em in I supply ya
I just flood the whole block, man you know I had to get it
Tryna run me up a ticket
The bitch bad and she with it
So you know I had to hit it

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless

[Verse 3: Yogii]
Shit, now I been gettin' this paper for a minute now
I'm tryna put gangsters in the position now
And I been kickin' flavor so consistent
I know that Lil Baby and Marlo with me, don't start Lil Trippy
Gotta keep that burner on me
I tried to turn some niggas up, they end up turnin' on me
And I don't need a bitch around me she don't serve a purpose
Them niggas fuckin' with you but I heard you're workin'
Woo, you're walkin' dead
I turned myself into a boss instead
My biggest struggle is tryna fit a quarter mill in my barber bag
Might hit your bitch and don't call her back, huh
I been workin' like I want all the cash

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I been workin' hard, I been grindin'
Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds
My new watch say perfect timing
I had to found it and I found it
I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer
In the hood you tryna find us
Me and my niggas we be ballin'
We gon' go get it regardless




 [Intro]
D. Sims
Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1]
Ridin' round on E, racks up to my knees
I can't get no sleep, if I ain't got no lean
Bad bitches follow me, my niggas a part of me
My bitch a hot commodity, I know my grandmom proud of me
I moved my mom from poverty
I hope they don't think 'bout robbin' me
I can fly, yeah I believe
In the cockpit where the pilot be
Don't need no stylist, I style for free
My young ho keep on callin' me, my old bitch keep on stalkin' me
Ain't gon' let a nigga take my shine from me
Should've been rappin', this rhymin' easy
Drop my top just to feel the breeze
Thugger my brother, yeah easy breezy
I just wanna fuck, don't tease me
They got my songs on repeat, yeah yeah
I don't want no money exchange
I went overseas and got some change

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry

[Verse 2]
Brand new Bentley, hit the block swervin'
12 say they know that I be workin' (fuck 12)
My PO she say I run the game (but I fuck with her)
Every time I see her I throw up the gang, yeah yeah yeah
Really ran the block, really keep a Glock, really serve the rock
Screamin' fuck the cops, screamin' fuck the opps, million in the vault
Oh you a gangster? let's see 'bout it nigga
Had them lil niggas to see 'bout you nigga
Oh you a gangster? let's shoot out lil nigga
Make my lil niggas go 2Pac a nigga
Had a million dollars on the low
I ain't even let nobody know
My role model get them truckloads
Bend her over, fuck her, then I'm gone
Ain't gon' put your name in a song
I'ma put your face on a shirt
I'ma put your body in the dirt
Nigga you a pussy, where your skirt?

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry
Switched up, I guess it wasn't workin'
Came back, guess it wasn't workin'
I think I'm addicted to the perkys
I'm tryna get this money in a hurry

 [Intro]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
I look up, I see I got bout seven rides in the streets
Know what I'm saying?
Living life to the fullest, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Same one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt at the clique
Main reason I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gonna say shit

[Verse 1]
I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it 100, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and they ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and Ced had two different spots, we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free the bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get tired, you can see the Adderall in my eyes
Tyga said he got the drop on the album
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block
Niggas know how we come through
G5 out the sunroof

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Same one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt at the clique
Main reason I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gonna say shit

[Verse 2]
We use trap out my ma house, turn the condo to a hideout
We can't be fuckin' at my house, niggas be runnin' they damn mouth
Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no fun in no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana
I just keep on buying all these Fantas
I don't want to go out like that, only thing I know is get racks

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that shit real deal, do you want some?
Same one that tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt at the clique
Main reason I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gonna say shit




 [Intro]
Know I'm sayin'?
This that new wave shit, know what I'm sayin'? (ya dig)
Man, this that new wave shit, ya dig? (4 Pockets Full)
Know what I'm sayin'? Watch them eat this one up (know what I'm saying?)
Okay
Free the gang

[Verse]
I'm smoking loud this that moonrock
They tryna sue me cause I'm gettin' paper
I dropped out of school didn't get no education
My momma, she happy 'cause I finally made it
She living better, her house big as fuck
Buy her a Bentayga Bentley truck
With a AP today, tomorrow switch it up
Honeycomb diamonds VVS's cuttin'
Standing on stage, I really came from nothing
I took me a break, don't mean I'm getting rusty
I'm gaining this weight they say I'm getting husky
I stand on front line I'm all about the fuckery
I go where I want, nobody better not fuck with me
Extended the glizzy shoot it til' it's empty
I come from the projects jumping over fences
I found me a plug and went and made a killing
I think we in love we should just have some children
Them narcs I been sipping got to have me trippin'
I didn’t come to play I had to reinvent me
I handled my business now I'm worth some millions
Remember the safe deposit box was empty
Them niggas weren't fucking with me they weren't friendly
If you weren't with me then, you ain't seeing him with me
We like Kanye and K, you like Bobby and Whitney
Real dope boy I ain't nothing' like the weirdos
Never seen me putting on the weird clothes
It cost a lil' more when it's real gold
We already up keep the field goal
Remember that day that I had lost all that cake
I had to go in the safe
I had to get me a pot and cook that shit up
Had 'em calling me Quay
I had got that shit back in like twenty-some-days
Ain’t no chump change, I’m talkin' bout' 500k
I went straight to the lot and went bought me a wraith
Ain't no more being humble put it in they face
I won't feed in the drama I'm ￼loving the hate
But one thing for sure, Lil Baby go crazy




 [Chorus]
Maybach parked outside
Take up two parking spots
Barely old enough to drive
I been gettin' way too high
Livin' large, livin' large, livin' large, livin' large
Everybody livin' large
Livin' large, livin' large, livin' large, livin' large
Everybody livin' large

[Verse]
Started from the bottom, now the condo so big I don't see nobody
Pink toes, long hair, runnin' 'round the lobby
Livin' large every day like I hit the lottery, livin' large
Five star restaurants
Watchin' Floyd fight, we in the front
Hawks game, we on the floor
Niggas' bitches dirty bird me, Julio
Take my dogs all around the globe
Shooters with me, they go everywhere I go
Stickin' to the code, ain't gon' never fold
I'ma stand up like a man, that's what I was told
Hoppin' off a plane fresh as fuck, screamin' free Steve
We done had a damn good year, you wouldn't believe
I done counted a whole million cash with my bare hands
Dashboard say two twenty-five, I'm 'bout to do it
Percocet and molly on my ass, I'm 'bout to lose it
We been countin' cash for three hours, gettin' to it
I don't care if they never found the body, I don't watch the news
So much money on the floor like we just left a move
Shootouts in broad day with the cops
Nigga it ain't safe on my block
Nigga came a long way from rocks
I can not go home without the guap
We got Glocks tucked in the stash spot
We don't stop at stop signs, I'ma keep going
Man they killed my dawg over nothing, we was too cool
Remember gettin' that J to check us in when we was in high school
Hellcat goin' real fast
Hopin' I don't crash, I'm just tryna stay focused




 [Intro]
Yeah, yeah
We ain't talked in like a week straight
I been all on the interstate
I been tryna go and get this cake
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

[Verse 1]
They thinkin' I lost it, remind them niggas
I can get flyer than niggas
Hundred thousand in a Gucci bookbag
They thinkin' I signed them niggas
I leveled my life up, this Rollie I got on don't tick tock
Still on that bullshit, if you pull up on me, let the stick talk
I'm in L.A. with the vibes, Dane in the cut getting high
She tryna get in my ride, she tryna turn up tonight, yeah
I was running up cash, yeah, I had ran up a bag
And they started gettin' mad, yeah
But I didn't get mad, I just kept getting cash, yeah
Now I'm in my bag, yeah, now I'm in my bag, yeah
She wanna get with me, she know that I'm sticky, but I'm in my bag now
She wasn't fucking with me, she didn't come around, she wishing she had now
And I'm in my bag now
I'm in the bag, the Goyard to be exact
Three hundred racks inside it, and that ain't no cap
I could've bought a Wraith today, yeah yeah
I ran it up, they supposed to hate
I'm digging this lifestyle
Water drippin' on me like I'm a faucet
The crew with me right now
You can play, just proceed with caution
I popped the wrong pill, now I'm nauseous
I need to get off this drank, it's a problem
I took a Tesla and landed on Mars​
Lord please wake me up tomorrow

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

[Verse 2]
They know they can't beat me, so they tryna leave me
And she tryna leave me, but I ain't gon' let her
Diamonds on Fiji, I'm running with QC
And Reebok endorse me, went up a new level
I'm loving this lifestyle and niggas wanna be me
I know they won't catch up, but I ain't gon' let 'em
As soon as the money get up to a million, put it in the ground and then go buy a new shovel
How you gon' be in yo feelings when I'm in my feelings?
We both can't be in our feelings
I ain't gon' lie when you thinkin' I did it, I did it
It's something 'bout your intuition
I'm telling you no lies, I'm tired of seeing you cry
Come here girl, let me wipe your eye
Everything gon' be alright

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all a nigga
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas

I'm just tryna live my life
Moon rocks, on stars, straight cash, no cards
Livin' life like stars, thankin' god every day we finally winning
You was 'posed to my nigga, right here with me
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Livin' for tomorrow, hopin' for tonight
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Livin' for tomorrow, hopin' for tonight

[Verse 1]
Push start cars, we can't fall
Started from the bottom now we here
Ran me up a mil, it took a year
Watch my closest niggas disappear
We ridin' drop tops whips in the summer
She keep checkin' in 'cause she know that I'm a winner
We gon' skip town just for dinner
We gon' keep it gutter, don't have no one in our business
Draped down in Fendi, she rockin' the latest
She say I'm the greatest, if I'm ollie then you later
Took a trip to the Barbados, and I'm still on paper
Shout out to my haters, they been motivating me lately
Came to fuck the game up, had to switch the wave up
Fuck me just don't lay up, on this codeine I can't stay up
Pitch a dub in a motor, just so they can't catch me
They tried to arrest me 'cause I'm icy like Wayne Gretzky
I'm a big bear like Tee Grizzley, these fuck niggas be sneak dissin'
This FN gon' stay with me, a nigga play that'll be the reason
G5 gone for a lot of seasons, Saks Ave, we done did Neimans
Them millions comin', I can damn see 'em
Long live Frank, I can see him breathin'
I got ten traps and they all beamin'
We done fucked the game up
They blowin' my name up
I just want the money, fuck the fame cuz
Came to switch the game up

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight

[Verse 2]
If tomorrow ain't promised then why should I wait?
If times still gon' be hard then why should I pray?
Seen my niggas fade away, from a cage to a grave
Solid niggas turned fake, seen it happen every day
Didn't expect it to happen, I thought you was solid
Still can't believe you not right here beside me
The money in front me, the bullshit behind me
My nigga forever, I thought we was riders
When we caught them cases both of us kept quiet
I just lost a friend to some gun play
Put my main bitch on the runway
Still servin' packs on the one way
Paying tithes Sunday, we gon' blow up one day
Magic on a Monday, shout out to the strippers
Lately I been feelin' it on another level
Savin' all the extras, I gotta be different

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight
I'm just tryna live my life
They say I ain't living right
Finest cars, designer, and the flashy ice
Hopin' for tomorrow, livin' for tonight

I'm one of the real ones, tunnel vision on the way to the millions
Keep me a check, flooded Patek

Pussy niggas tellin' lies, they don't know me
The same niggas talkin' down probably owe me

I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Verse 1]
Bitch I don't milly rock, I get the money
I got two bitches with me tryna jump me
Remember them old heads wouldn't front me
I'm shittin' on 'em, got 'em holdin' they stomach
That paper on me, gettin' it in by the bundle
The things they dream about a nigga done done it
Them bitches was stiff on the kid, they was frontin'
Now I'm stickin' dick all in they stomach
Drip season nigga, shout out to Gunna
No pussy in me but they know how I'm comin'
Drop a bag and he'll be dead in the morning
Headshots, I ain't sending no warnings
We don't shoot at houses, we hit a target
They  know I'm throwed off, they see I'm a target
No back and forth, we ain't doin' no walkin'
I stand on my words, I ain't doin' no barkin'

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up

Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Verse 2]
Came up on them niggas, didn't it
Hundred racks on me, I'ma spend it
This ain't Lacoste, nigga this Givenchy
Thousand pounds, me and Ced split it
Free Lil Steve, screamin' fuck the system
Dog I ain't know that was your sister
If I knew I still woulda hit her
Goin' crazy on them niggas, woah
Got the streets in a finger four
Your baby mama got a deep throat
I ain't kiddin', I don't tell jokes
Who want beef, I want all the smoke
I'm ballin' on these niggas, check the score
Flexin' on the Gram with your bro
Your bitch told me everything I know
Diss me nigga, you gon' get exposed

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups

 [Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I had to spread my wings, jump out my nest
Ran out of Act so I'm pourin' up red
I took the harder way like I'm Derez
Shout out the doctor keep givin' these meds
I got the streets in a lock like some dreads
Ride on the back of that bitch like some pegs
Runnin' this shit, they should cut off my legs
Had to play a little smarter, I'm using my head
Dropped out of school, took the street way instead
I'm a lil' dope boy, I want me some bread
I'ma shoot at your body, won't aim for your neck
I just cashed out on a flooded Patek
It ain't a big one, but dammit, it's big enough
I just came home from the can, I'ma live it up
I rep the gang, when you see me, I'ma throw it up
I just spent three hundred racks on a Bentley truck

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Gotta maintain, can't go back broke
Gotta stand tall, won't bend or fold
Drop top 'Vette, tryna keep it in a Rolls
Ain't signin' no deal, ain't sellin' my soul
Gotta run it up fast, my mama gettin' old
I'm a million dollar nigga, gotta reach my goal
Got the hood on my back, still throwin' up fours
They say the Act gettin' low, I'm still pourin' up fours
I pour the six if it cost me
I like to fuck on your ho on the balcony
I got the cheese and I got me some broccolli
All color money, this shit like monopoly
Can't get this drip, ain't no need for you watchin' me
I ran my racks up and I moved out of poverty
I'm keepin' designer all over my body
I got some Buscemi, I got new Givenchy
Damn I thought I'd never see the day
I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me
I'm gettin' money, ain't really got time to beef
I don't know why these lil bitches be lyin' on me
I'm the jungle forreal where them lions be
I'm goin' apeshit, they callin' me Willy B
These niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me but we'll see
I'm gon' make every nigga with 'em fear me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Outro: Lil Baby]
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah

Blow the money fast as I can

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Audemar Piguet wet
Diamonds get these bitches wet
Fat knots make a bitch fuck somethin'
Ass shots make a nigga cuff somethin'
One-sixty on my hair, I'm gleaming
Every time that I step I'm bleeding
Crackers get behind me, I'm speeding
That's my dawg so you know we fleeing
Shawty said she got a bone to pick
Who's this ho I been rollin' with?
Everybody callin' her phone and shit
Know me better, I don't know the bitch
Free my dogs in the cages
I'm a project lil' baby
In the projects with Lil Baby
I used to tote three-eighties
Now I tote twelve gauges
Got my Charger whip ajudicated
I'm too smooth baby
Trust me you don't need to lubricate it
My lil' snipers say them niggas be hatin' ever since you done made it
I don't know why, 'cause I could've bought the Wraith but I bought a new Mercedes
I just bought a new Mercedes, but I could've bought the Wraith
'Cause I gotta feed my family, make sure everybody ate
Make sure everybody straight, 'cause you gotta feed the team
Boy you gotta spread the cheese, boy you gotta split the cake
Don't feed your dogs, they gon' get hungry and go to lickin' on your plate
Make sure my dawg don't turn out to a mutt, he gon' be a Great Dane
That part, that's my dawg like Clifford
My dawg, my goddamn nigga
You can bring your dawg, I'ma Vick him
Don't step too hard, I'ma sic him

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

[Outro]

Plug talk, I can put you on
Hundred bags of gas, get 'em gone
Made a couple digits off a phone
Diss me, I won't put you in a song
All my youngins put in work
They gon' put you on a shirt
The last nigga got murked
I prayed about it at church
All I think about is drinkin' syrup
I been gettin' faded, poppin' percs
All my diamonds water, you can surf
Porsche 911, it's a vert
Oh they doin' that, I did it first
Fuck you give me ten for a verse
Nightmares, I'm gon' be the worst
All my problems put 'em in a hearse
Fuck her good, buy that bitch a purse
Eat the pussy, blame it on the perc
Nigga you was rappin', you a jerk
I was really trappin', nigga servin'
Quarter million, put it in the air
Grover called me, told me that it's there
Rich nigga rockin' Moncler
Change of plans, I ain't playin' fair

[Chorus]
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag

Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy
I rock Givenchy, I do this shit for a living
The narcs in the hood, they been trippin'
All in my business, so all my rental cars tinted
Boy I ain't been broke in a minute, I swear I been gettin' it
Still sendin' packs to the prison
Run the money all the way up, wonderful feeling
Bust down Rollies came from scratch
Catch a nigga slipping, do him bad
Take a nigga's shit, won't give it back
Half a bag, get a nigga whacked
Wreck the Masi, go and get a Jag
Hellcat goin' real fast
Fuck 12, I ain't goin' back
Do it for the shit I never had
Niggas droppin' salt 'cause they mad
They don't wanna see me with a bag
A lot of times I just wanna spazz
But I fall back and just laugh
I won't let you trick me out my spot
Niggas having pressure 'bout a thot
These bitches lovin' the crew
We take 'em down by the two

[Chorus]
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag
Look at my drip, my drip, my swag

 [Chorus]
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high

[Verse 1]
I gotta slow down ain't tryna lose my mind
I got on two watches tryna keep up with the time
Do this for Lil Steve, they gave my lil' homie a dime
You can't see the greatness in me nigga then you blind
I went back to the basics didn't sign
Tryna treat me like I'm basic not I
I got all these blue faces oh my
I'ma stack it to the ceiling, sky high
I been catching all these flights got sky miles
I'd probably spend my last to see her smile
I was just sittin' in the prison goin wild, now I'm standing on stage gettin paid, they like my sound

[Chorus]
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line

Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high

[Verse 2]
I think I fell in love with her she way too fine
I can't go back to no prison got to walk a tight line
Niggas act like they don't fuck with me but on my timeline
Gettin' fucked up on the block I had some very long nights
I'ma savage to my heart you can see it in my eyes
If I tell you I'll quit trappin babygirl then I'll be lying
Saint Laurent my jacket, Valentino on my shoes
Take me for a joke they try to treat me like a fool
Super paranoid i don't leave the house without my tool
Hundred bricks in I got it snowing while it's June
Hardly ever see my son that shit hurt me
My bitch act like she don't understand I'm working
I'm like, "how the fuck you think you got them purses?"
And the way you out here actin' you don't deserve shit
Don't keep callin' my phone that shit gettin' worrisome​
And I keep drinkin' this lean I'm just gettin' worser

[Chorus]
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high
She all on my drip she just like my vibe
Tell 'em they can step over it's my time
I get what I want and I don't wait in line
Keep poppin' these percs I done got way too high

This shit was hard for us, we thought we all was stuck
They told me go get it and I went and got it
Lil nigga I'm the one that got it poppin'
Lil nigga pull up on ya, try to pop ya

Pussy nigga hatin', pocket watching(I see you watchin nigga)
Hope that they ain't forget the pocket rocket
Everything I do is expensive, old school dash digit
I been grindin' for a minute, I been really really gettin' it
We was really in them kitchens, I can show you how to get it
Turned a nickle to a fifty, turned a fifty to a dollar
Take the dollar to your partners, show 'em how to add the water
Lock it up and make it harder, Bentley ridin' with the mobsters
He know he pasta, we hit on oodles of noodles
We got the weight, that's a full one, damn she just blew me
Pass me the percs I need two of 'em
Get to the money, I'm racin'
Bitch better check my trap, I'm gettin' money
Pockets full, why not, FN on the side
Niggas try me they gon' die
Youngins screamin' what's the price? I can't wait to let 'em slide
It's gon' be a homicide
I ain't gotta tell no lies, 4PF until I die

[Chorus]

 [Intro]
Cook that shit up Quay

[Chorus]
I got accuracy when I shoot that stick (that stick)
It ain't gon' jam, I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' miss (ain't gon' miss)
I told my PO no more syrup and that I quit (that I quit)
But I was lyin' 'cause I had codeine in my piss
I'm takin' hard drugs, Tylenols, and Adderalls, and Percocets
They keep my faded
Came up out the trenches a millionaire, a nigga damn near made it
Ran it up and lost it all again, damn near drove me crazy
Couple homies owe me think I'm up so they ain't gotta pay me

[Verse 1]
When I hired out my whole team now they my faculty
Ever since I got that bag these bitches after me
She done sent this text that said she pregnant, she said gon' keep it
Thinkin' to myself like how hell did she get my semen?
My lil' nigga can't wait to wild out, they just need a reason
Thousand pounds of gas at the spot like it's Harvest season
My lil' homie thuggin' jus' got out but he keep his heater
I can't let Lil' Tiger out the house, he like to shoot at people
Two seater Beamer on my way to pick this money up
Semi tuck, try your luck, draw down, I won't give it up
Never runnin' from em', we runnin' to 'em, we on that bullshit
Let it slide, catch 'em out in public, we gon' deal with 'em

[Chorus]
I got accuracy see when I shoot that stick (that stick)
It ain't gon' jam, I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' miss (ain't gon' miss)
I told my PO no more syrup and that I quit (that I quit)
But I was lyin' 'cause I had codeine in my piss
I'm takin' hard drugs, Tylenols, and Adderalls, and Percocets
They keep my faded
Came up out the trenches a millionaire, a nigga damn near made it
Ran it up and lost it all again, damn near drove me crazy
Couple homies owe me think I'm up so they ain't gotta pay me

[Verse 2]
You gon' pay me when I see you, I need that money
Keep a smile on my face but it ain't funny
When I press the button they smashin' on site
We snuck the pistols in the club, we ain't tryna fight
Free all of my dawgs behind the walls fuck the system
Let em' pull up on me like it's cool, then we gon' flip 'em
Try to tell my man to slow it down but he went missin'
Couple months later I got the word somebody killed him
Man them hollow tips gon' burn when they get inside
Run it up I'm buyin' cars, this my fifth ride
Playin' with the startin' five, it ain't no sixth guy
You can see it in my eye, I won't let shit slide

[Chorus]
I got accuracy see when I shoot that stick (that stick)
It ain't gon' jam, I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' miss (ain't gon' miss)

Ran it up and lost it all again, damn near drove me crazy
Couple homies owe me think I'm up so they ain't gotta pay me

They think they ain't gon' pay me but I need mine, I need mine

My nigga got caught, I just hope he don’t tell
If you can sit quiet then I’ll pay your bail
They not gon' snitch if they send me to hell

[Verse 2]
You won’t believe what I made in a year
I’m flippin' these bags, I made me a mill
Then I start rappin' and got me a deal
I took off fast, this shit get for real
She want to talk but she don’t want to hear
All she want me to do is keep it real
She keep on cryin' I'm tired of her tears
I keep on lyin' it just what it is
I'm on my grind, so fuck how you feel
I got some homies who sittin' in the pen
Yeah, yeah
They gon' be sittin' in that bitch for some years
We were some teens, they labeled us grown
Had some judges who doin' us wrong
I know your pain just hold on
Just sing this song

Oh that's your señorita? She goin' too

Peep out the window with that K like Malcolm X was
I bless lil' shawty with all kinda bags, and you ain't gotta ask for it
I drop some racks for it, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Pink slip to my auto, I paid cash for it
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard

Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Sippin' on codeine, I poured my last four
Now a nigga want more, this the shit I asked for

Have a nigga lookin' for who shot ya
Probably in Jamaica with the Rastas
I'm gon' get 'em in for the cheap
And them bitches go for twenty-three
I know that these niggas envy me
And won't stop until I reach the T-O-P, I'm at the top
I'm acting crazy again, I had your lady again
Know she told you we was friends, but she ate the dick in the Benz
She know I'm a real one, she smell it
She do whatever I tell her
She let me hit it whenever as long as I keep on necklace
I ate that pussy for breakfast, yeah yeah
Diamonds on my neck, I got 'em frozen
Water on my wrist came from the ocean
Every nigga with me get them loads in
Only with the bros who put them fours in
Pink slip

Pink slip to my auto, I paid cash for it
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard

Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Sippin' on codeine, I poured my last four
Now a nigga want more, this the shit I asked for

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
This the type of shit I used to ask for
Remember down bad, I had to ask for it
Damn I'm out of lean, I poured my last four
Now my car say two hundred on dashboard
I get that money for real, I get that paper for real, yeah yeah
I get that money for real, I get that paper for real, yeah yeah
All my diamonds on me, yeah they shining
When I made parole that's perfect timing
Range Rover look pregnant with the body
Presidential tint so I can't see nobody
Your bitch on my hitlist 'cause she's a hottie
I know once I get in it I'm gon' ride it
I get that money forever, we get that money together, dig that
Bitches be walkin' up on me, niggas be actin' like groupies, get back
Gettin' to the money since like this high
Now I'm lil big homie all on this side

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Pink slip to my auto, I paid cash for it
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Sippin' on codeine, I poured my last four
Now a nigga want more, this the shit I asked for
Pink slip to my auto, I paid cash for it
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Sippin' on codeine, I poured my last four
Now a nigga want more, this the shit I asked for

 [Intro]
Run that money counter baby

[Hook]
Last night I didn't come home my bitch probably think I was cheating

Ain't got time for no hoes, I been on some other shit
Tryna get my mother rich, tryna get my brothers rich
Last night I didn't come my bitch probably think I was cheating

[Verse 1]
They tryna ride my wave, I had to switch it up
They tryna ride in my lane, I had to buck a left
I had to cut off my feet to save myself
Stayed down and went and raised my wealth
We was waitin' on the mailman, we had to track it, he had the package
Soon as we get it the pack in, 30 minutes later racks in
Thousand dollar belt for my pants
Ridin' round beating I'm the man
I can get them bags on demand
Count the money fast with my hands
Shooters they gon' shoot on my command
Got these bands dawg
Hope out and go get it forreal, I went and got it forreal
They tryna tell me to chill, this just the way that I live
I be on syrup forreal, I just keep buyin' these seals
I know I'm never gon' squeal, give a damn how they feel
Baby Jace, sitting next to me on the roads to riches
Lil Dee, sittin' next to me on the road to riches
DT ridin' shotgun on the road to riches
They tryna ride my wave, they tryna ride my wave

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just got a call from my dawg he just came home, told me that he got out on his dick so I'ma put him on
Couple niggas talkin' flaw, they all sing the same songs
Get a nigga left on the yard for a cellphone
I got some young niggas ready to crash out, I had a thousand pounds at the stash spot
And I'ma hold it down for the havenots
I still remember times I ain't have nothing
I ain't no greedy nigga you can have some
All of my niggas eatin' go and ask 'em
They don't want no smoke they got asthma
Bitch I'm a street nigga I ain't no rapper
They should put me on a runway, drippin' like a sundae
Make yo bitch see how this dick taste, a million off a mixtape
Niggas hate but I just dictate
I control the shots
Boy I control the block
Boy I control that rock
You gon' need a way bigger surfboard
Got allot of money but I want more
Go and get that paper ain't have no choice
My son gon' be a boss cause he's my first born

[Hook]
Last night I didn't come my bitch probably think I was cheating

 [Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I know my mama prayin' for me, it's kinda hard for her to sleep
When she hearin' I got beef and I'm really in the streets
But she know her son a G, ain't gon' fold, ain't told
I ain't rolled, when the pressure was on I bust chrome
Six o'clock on the dot, niggas still at the spot
Got a play for three blocks, I might serve 'em or take 'em off
I'm tryna figure it out, fuck it I'ma figure it out

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I'm up early in the morning tryna run me up a bag
But a nigga on the run 'cause the narcs on my ass
I'm slidin' in the I, nigga I'm slidin' in the I
And it's for a pocketful but a nigga playin' for keeps
And a nigga got a drum 'cause a nigga in the streets
So I'm grindin' I, nigga I'm grindin' I

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street

Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die

[Verse 3: Bite Da Don]
They havin' pressure 'bout these hoes, we havin' bags of this shit
I got four pockets full and coupe around my wrist
Know I play for keeps I got paper out the street
Pull up at your spot, air that bitch out for a week
I finessed 'em out the cash, Rudy bought the jeep
I was in the flat with beat, we got dracos for the beef
I ain't lyin' I'm a beast, them hoes say y'all niggas cheapskates
Duffel bag full of cash like I hit the sweepstakes

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All I know is play for keeps, I ain't slept in 'bout a week
Niggas screamin' we got beef, shell casings in the street
You gon' ride or die, you gon' ride or die
Sixteen on the block, had to run me up some guap
Turn some soft into a rock, keep on whippin' 'til it lock

All I know is money and I need me some more
You know I ain't just talkin', they know this

Let's meet there, relax, I won
Change from the Pentagon next thing on her tongue
500 cash with me that's why I got this bag on (racks)
I came from rags to riches now tryna sell out the dome
My bitches skinny dippin' they all got thongs on
You ain't tryna get rich you gotta gone gone gone
I got my weed from Jamaica, Sean Paul
Tryna be the reason niggas hating on all y’all
Stayed down in this law, we get paid off
Big homie taught me if it's a plug don't run off, ay
Nigga stack a G like a Phillipean
And we smokin' weed, drinkin' codeine (drank it, drank it)
And I got some M's I could buy Hardees (I could buy Hardees)
And I got some water, you can't walk in these
Turn the mansion to a club, let's have a party (let's have a party)
We got options, you can drink some Act, red or green?
All this [?] I drink
Got me tearin' up the fuckin' street
I like it, I see [?] nigga, I know CD

 [Chorus: Lil Baby]
I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (from me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm tryna make a way for my folks
Seein' how I'm Oakland City only hope
I gotta get it, I ain't got time to play
Ain't got no time to waste
I've been havin' nightmares about goin' back to jail, so I wake up
Drankin' all this lean, poppin' Adderall so I can stay up
Niggas that I used to love actin' like they're mad 'cause I got my cake up
Ain't gon' never let it get to a nigga, keep on grindin', tryna get another million
Condo on Peachtree, I paid the rent for the closet
They just wanna talk about my past, they don't wanna accept the fact that I'm a boss
Everything I wanted, I'ma go and get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout a cost, yeah
Everybody want a piece of the winnings, they're never there when you're lost
Seen my main man try to cross me, I'm tryna pass it down to my offspring
All these hoes see me flossing, seen my first mil', felt awesome
They can't follow me, I lost 'em
Had to boss up, so I bossed up
Now I'm bossed up

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (from me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
She gotta be piped up to feel my emphasis
She hot, yeah, she sizzlin', but can't love her more than a studio
Serena and Venus, yeah most of my chains tennis
So I wore it all to the studio (studio)
My baby mama got pregnant, had to buy a bitch a car to get an abortion
She just wanna see tears and sad faces on my shorty
But I can't get mad, that's the way it go when you're fortunate
Leave a million cash in the street, nigga better not touch it (on God)
Act like they came to lay hands so their trust don't get busted (no cap)
Straight from Mossberg to his borough
Birds, bless the J's on that cizzurb
Ridin' in the Lambo that the lil' kids say "Bingo" to
My last two years were the worst ones in my career, but I'm still rich as you
Disneyland's where your kids go, on a private jet when I'm into you (when I'm into you)
Them lil' bitches that be hatin' need to pipe down (pipe down)

[Chorus: Lil Baby (Lil Baby & Young Thug)]
(I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now)
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (from me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio

And he got a black 45 screaming "need more cash"
A nigga ask me do I got some murder for hire
Lovin' on a bitch I prolly won't know her tomorrow
My lil partner from the westside caught a murder case
Say his lawyer want a hundred but he got 50k
Told me that he had a feeling he was halfway

I don't play no games I'm going straight up

And heard the homie he got-

Never save a ho, always give and go
Give her what she want, never tell her no
Grind hard, ain't never goin' broke

On the yacht, it was me and Lil Boat
I'm a slime, I'll fuck any nigga's ho
Real easy like einy meany miny mo

Ain't blood but I'm blazin' nigga, I go crazy nigga
My chain cost one-eighty nigga, I tried to save them niggas
Nigga you can't save that nigga, catch that nigga, spray that nigga

If I wasn't rappin' I'd be trappin'
Rental car, blendin' in with traffic
Gettin' a load in on the tractor
I got 'em scared, they knowin' I'm a factor
Jumped in the game, ran it up faster
Hundred racks bustin' out the plastic
Leavin' Magic City with a dancer
Made myself a boss, I'm from Atlanta
I put a half a pint in the Fanta
FN make it hard to keep my pants up
Ridin' 'round the city in a Phantom
Kidnap a rapper, make him pay the ransom
Niggas be fake, so we don't even dap 'em
They knowin' I'm real, you can go and ask
Before I was rappin' I was gettin' them bags in

Draco on me, and it's still all wood
I'm on probation, they let off a fool
They on my drip, tryna see what I do
They takin' notes, tryna study my moves
They tryna do what I do
All-Star weekend, I was gettin' the pack in
Heard you got your shit took, nigga you lackin'
Big body Benz "beep, beep" when it back in
Real street niggas buyin' bags with the backends
These niggas ain't authentic, they actin'
And I ain't get to the money, they cappin'
What happened?
I thought you was a real one?
Solitary stones in my ear, these the clear ones
These diamonds dancin' too loud in my ear, so I don't hear them
My homie got the stick, I got the glizzy
We don't fear them
These niggas don't wanna play with us
I swear that we gon' kill them

[Chrous]
I just got some stupid dome from this hoe from the Southside
Long live Troup, my OG man, that nigga from the Southside
Shout out Deezy and them Lo's who crippin' on the Southside
I get bags in for the low and send them to the Southside
Yeah, I'm sellin' coke for real
I put the "d" in dope for real
Saint Laurent on my coat for real

Shoutout to Clayhead, that nigga a real one

Strapped




 [Intro]
Yeah, Southside

[Verse]
Super Bowl ring, we ballin' hard, we won the championship
Everybody got somethin' to say when I ain't even ask 'em shit
Bunny rabbit broke, take a brick and do a magic trick
A hundred racks a show, get on the stage and do a backwards flip (yeah)
I'm in L.A. with some real Crips
I want Stella McCartney, this real drip
Cartier on my face with the wood tear
Put the knife on the K, it's the real deal
Make 'em get out this bitch like a fire drill
If I won't hit a bitch then the guys will
I've been on it, today I took five pills
I'ma run up them M's 'cause it's God's will
How you gon' check me?
She like my gangsta, she wanna arrest me
She wanna sex me (yeah)
I got the block her, she know not to text me
Comin' at you niggas 3D
They gon' put this shit on repeat
Everything I say, they repeat
Any nigga try to sneak diss
I ain't gon' say nothin' back, yeah
I'ma keep gettin' these racks, yeah
When you speak 'bout me, speak facts, yeah
Got an FN on the kickback, yeah
Big nose, hood on the demon
Big to the streets, I'm a deacon
They wouldn't even peep what I was preachin'
They just wanna see me with the leaches
Big ballers, I ain't in the bleachers
Courtside, high five the ref
Codeine got me talkin' to myself
Blowin' up, I'm blowin' out my belt
Real G top 5, nah, for real
Only 25 before the deal
Every time we slide, a nigga kill
I just hope to God that they appeal

[Outro]
G5 sittin' in the cell
He 'bout to come (came home)
I got this money on me right now
I don't even answer my phone (put 'em on)
I had these bitches in state to state
They tryna give me some play (leave me alone)
They know that I ain't got time to waste
I'm tryna get in their face (I'm goin' home)
I might just give you a couple of dollars
And make sure you good on a model (good)
They know they'll probably gon' see me again
Unless I'm in that new Benz
I put the Forgiatos on the car
Naked Tundras on the truck
I got the money, I'm runnin' it up
And I've been puttin' it up (them M's)




 [Intro: Lil Baby]

[Chorus: Lil Baby & 4PF DT]
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody

They'll spray a hundred rounds out the draco
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the draco

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Fourteen with a bankroll
Only god knows all the shit that I been through

I stayed down for the come-up now I'm stunting with my whole crew
Young niggas who with me 'bout whatever, they get cheddar
Boss up on them niggas, I done reached another level
Had some soda and some yola and I put that shit together
Hot boys thuggin', I try to tell 'em do better
I was on the rock gettin' paper

All these bitches tell me they gon' chase me
I don't chase it, I'm not a chaser

[Chorus: Lil Baby & 4PF DT]
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low

Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Hundred rounds on the Draco
Lil D, he gon' shoot when I say so
All I know is real lives but my niggas on go
I'ma stand up on the block like a fuckin' light pole
Wish I would've stayed in school but I didn't
My mama tried to show me the right way but I didn't listen
But now I'm in the spot, on [?] streets, in the kitchen
And I'm fifteen but I ran up them digits (I ran them digits up)
Dracos like YoungBoy
I'm a young boy
Tommy gun boy
Just for fun boy
Breakin' in cars, we used to rob, it was hard
We used to starve, we came far

[Chorus: Lil Baby & 4PF DT]
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco
Who the fuck want smoke, nobody
I was fourteen with a bankroll, mask off
Forty on my hip, I lay low
Got some bros that'll shoot when I say so
They'll spray a hundred rounds out the Draco

Everywhere I go the stick on me

Percocet got me moonwalking
Young nigga tryna stay focused
Niggas play we gon' lay 'em down
Hit his block gon' spray them rounds

Blood diamonds straight out the ground
So many hundreds I done lost count

[Verse 1: Rylo Rodriguez]
Run it up on a daily
Bad bitches on me daily

Banana clip on the Draco you know I'll never let 'em play me
Chains on me like Kunta Kinte, I'll never let 'em slave me
Young nigga watch who you serve these niggas 12 like Brady
Fuck a bitch like Bobby Brown, I'll take it back to the 80's
Rylo come from the 90's
Cashing out on these diamonds
We'll hold a nigga hostage
If he don't pay it's a homi
I had to struggle in the projects, you ain't seen the shit I seen
They say we promoting violence
Bodies dropping, murder scene
Could've went and bought Balenci', but I spent it on the teeth
Don't ask me do I got my glizzy, bitch you know that's my ID

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go the stick on me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
No my niggas never switch on me
Glock 40 with the dick on it
Hunnit round with the stick on it
Trigger finger got a itch on it

I can't settle for no minimum wage
We'll set this bitch up in flames
Hide ya nigga now don't fuckin' play
Interrogation I ain't say shit

Poppin' shit I'ma stay lit

Middle finger to my opponent
Screaming out who the fuck want it?

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go the stick on me

Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Jumped right off the porch and straight to the streets
I went and got me some dough
But that ain't enough, I want some more
I want some more and some more
Jumped right out of class and straight to the club
Now she dancing on the pole
But that ain't enough, she want some more

Redhead with me like I'm Yachty
Every nigga with me got a body
Bad mamacita call me papi
Back to back Lambs and the Raris
Only thing I wear is red bottoms
Free my nigga Long, the feds got him
Standin' on the sofa poppin' bottles
Crack a nigga head with a bottle
Sippin' lean, tryna ease my problems
Run up on a gang of niggas, shot 'em
Gucci glasses, snakes on my collar
Made these bitches rake up every dollar
She said she gon' catch it, she gon' swallow
Had to switch it up, I'm on the road now
I'm a stand up guy, I ain't gon' lay down
Seventeen five on my feet
Blowin' money like I hang with Meech
Louis V mixed with Supreme
Hop out in Givenchy, oh he clean
Gran Coupe, 2018
Try me, it's gon' be a murder scene
Everything I say a nigga mean

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Jumped right off the porch and straight to the streets

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Got four pockets full like I'm Baby
Keep Twan with me case they play me
Goons at they door 'til they pay me
Baby blue brand new Mercedes
Six chocolate bitches came from Haiti
Nigga never made the honor roll
But the nigga made the Forbes List
Hundred thousand on my left wrist
Orange stones in a nigga mouth
When the sun hit it look like Sunkist
Big pendant 'round a nigga neck
Talkin' same size as a starfish
And a nigga know killers, got killers
Nigga same kind as Scarface
And a nigga ball like Hardaway
And a nigga ball like Barkley
And I put that on my soul, I got pictures up in Vogue
I got bitches always killin' shit, they always at the moge
I meant morgue, I don't shop at the stores
I don't fuck with these lame ass sorry ass whores, on god

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Jumped right off the porch and straight to the streets
I went and got me some dough
But that ain't enough, I want some more
I want some more and some more
Jumped right out of class and straight to the club

She want some more and some more
Jumped right off the porch and straight to the streets
I went and got me some dough
But that ain't enough, I want some more
I want some more and some more
Jumped right out of class and straight to the club
Now she dancing on the pole

 [Intro]
Aye
We really came from that block, nigga, like
Nah sayin'?
Gotta watch yourself
They always watchin'
They gon' have to do they job

[Chorus]
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job
I'ma take before I starve
Every day it was hard, I been golden since the start
Duckin' feds, runnin' the cars
In the streets ain't no awards
So this Rollie be my trophy
I'm just tryna survive the motions
I'm just tryna survive the motions

[Verse 1]
First of all let me say
Free Lil Jacques and D
Man they been gon' for a long while
Two lifes plus eight five, they got a long time
Damn they got my dawgs in a jam
Free all of my dawgs out the can
Stand on my two feet just like a man
In the yard goin' hard, when I touched down I had a plan
Twenty days, a hundred bands, I did that
You come from the jungle, I can dig that
You can't tell me nothin' 'bout the struggle
Man these streets I'm really in 'em, every day I had to live that

[Chorus]
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job
I'ma take before I starve
Every day it was hard, I been golden since the start
Duckin' feds, runnin' the cars
In the streets ain't no awards
So this Rollie be my trophy
I'm just tryna survive the motions
I'm just tryna survive the motions

[Verse 2]
Keep my heart open
I been heart broken
Every soda that I drink it got lean inside it
Every nigga who ain't with me swear they livin' inside me
Pour me up some syrup so I can focus
I'm just tryna survive the motions
In the meantime, gotta by my mama a new Benz
Came out hard on them niggas
Fuck who ain't with me, I don't need friends
Niggas mad at me 'cause they hoes on my drip
Nigga fall back 'fore that ho get you killed
Had to crawl back, lost a whole quarter mil
Fuck you and them niggas that's with you, that's how I feel

[Chorus]
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job
I'ma take before I starve
Every day it was hard, I been golden since the start
Duckin' feds, runnin' the cars
In the streets ain't no awards
So this Rollie be my trophy
I'm just tryna survive the motions
I'm just tryna survive the motions




 [Intro: Lil Baby]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Take off, take off

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Stay down, get that money, take off (take off)
Got three hundred bands in a Goyard (Goyard)
All my niggas know it's go hard
If I send the word they gon' come and take your face off (face off)
I ain't never gon' stop (nah)
Guarantee I'm gon' pop (I'm gon' pop)
Drop an album, I won't flop (I won't flop)
Standing on the stage, I'm a star (star)
This shit wasn't easy, I had to work hard

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Goin' to school in a hotbox
They killed my nigga Juan, damn near broke my heart
I'm goin' number one when I hit the charts
Riding 'round with a lot of money so I keep my Glock
I blew up super fast, guess that's why they mad
Touch my chain, murder scene, body bag
I do this for all the shit I never had
Gotta be her for my niece, ain't got no father, I'm her dad
You remember we was skipping school
Going on the move, fucked around and made the news
I'm so glad we didn't get caught
Looking back on it, I'm like damn I came far

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Stay down, get that money, take off (take off)
Got three hundred bands in a Goyard (Goyard)
All my niggas know it's go hard
If I send the word they gon' come and take your face off (face off)
I ain't never gon' stop (nah)
Guarantee I'm gon' pop (I'm gon' pop)
Drop an album, I won't flop (I won't flop)
Standing on the stage, I'm a star (star)
This shit wasn't easy, I had to work hard

[Verse 2: Snap Dogg]
Stayed down and came up, had to get my change up
Only fuck with day ones, hell nah we can't change up
Niggas ain't clutching for real, niggas ain't toting the steel
Niggas ain't working for real, all of my niggas want M's
They love when I'm up in the booth
They know that I'm speaking the truth
They feeling my pain, this shit is insane
They know when I'm telling the truth
For the change I'll blow off your roof
And your partner, he gettin' it too
It's a tag on his head, green light on his ass
Hell yeah, go kill his whole crew
I done came up in the city and these niggas wanna hate
I can't fuck with niggas 'cause they really turned snake
I ain't got time for these hoes
I'm on the road doing shows around the globe

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Stay down, get that money, take off (take off)
Got three hundred bands in a Goyard (Goyard)
All my niggas know it's go hard
If I send the word they gon' come and take your face off (face off)
I ain't never gon' stop (nah)
Guarantee I'm gon' pop (I'm gon' pop)
Drop an album, I won't flop (I won't flop)

Only time I'm in crowed, they both tell
They can say it was vacuum sealed with no smell
I was sitting in jail with no bail
I was sitting in prison getting no mail
My nigga switching up on me I don’t care
They got jack shit on him he won't tell
ZO6 Vette, ridin' the fast lane, hope I don't wreck
I'm on that red
Pourin it up with most disrespect
Forgiato on my cars now
I been fuckin 'round with the stars now
5 stars for my lineup
Give these niggas a chance but they time us
Switch the hustle, I did get the grind up
In the spot hundred dollars the lineup
Only big homie niggas can line us
Stickin dick in this bitch cause she fine as fuck

[Chorus: Lil Baby]

YSL we come and change the climate
Rode with twenty thousand one out of Onyx
Swear the ring, the chain, watch, Avianne
I got shooters in the trunk right behind me
I got spots like a cheetah won't find me
Young Gunna fell in love with these diamonds
Pressure god only rocking the finest
I done told you the crew almighty
Several time I gotta remind you
If you my dog I gotta ride with you
I got you dog on whatever the issue
Free my dogs out of prison I miss you
Fuck the laws and whoever against you

Showing love it could all be so simple

Getting paid, I don't need no credentials

[Chorus: Lil Baby]

Cartier glasses they sit on my face

Taking drugs, tryna ease the pain

They know that I'm paid, ain't been in town in days
Most of these niggas they old news
All these bitches been ran through

Then spend all the dubs on getting money
Straight from the 'jects to a jet

Let's take a trip, if we leave now, we can land tonight
We gon' take a trip to Dubai, guarantee you won't see nobody
Nobody safe where I come from

 [Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
I'ma keep going
I'ma keep on going-oing-oing-oing-oing
I'ma keep on going-oing-oing-oing-oing
Yeah

[Chorus]
They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk
2018, it came with auto-park
Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars
Never leave my niggas, I love all of y'all
Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar
Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt
I didn't have a car, I used to walk far
Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

[Verse 1]
Whole milly in my safe, could've went and bought a Wraith
I decided I should wait, movin' niggas out the way
Free Tay-K, I beat the case
Got a bank account with Chase
Half a million in my safe
Swear I'm on my way
Screamin' free Kevin Gates
I go and get it by any means
Rockin' red bottoms with Amiri jeans
Pop a percocet, take a sip of lean
I bought real diamonds for the whole team
I been gettin' money since thirteen
I been grinding hard, stayin' lowkey
Sellin' whole bags of the OG
Get you knocked off for a low fee
Diamonds hittin' hard, no lights needed
Run it up fast like light speed
Runnin' up the cost in a white tee
I don't go on dates, we fuckin' right now
Make 'em treat me like a king, I got 'em bowing down

[Chorus]
They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk
2018, it came with auto-park
Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars
Never leave my niggas, I love all of y'all
Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar
Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt
I didn't have a car, I used to walk far
Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

[Verse 2]
Rockstar status me
My last bitch abandoned me
We could've had a family
That shit made a man of me
I got niggas mad at me
Niggas I ain't never seen
I don't drink green lean
I fell in love with codeine
Jumpin' on the stage, look at the crowd, I got 'em goin' wild
Only rock the latest, they all on me, checkin' out my style
Chain gang, sittin' in the cell I had my first child
Mama tried to keep me in the house but I was runnin' wild
Sellin' nicks and dimes to the fiends at the West End Mall
Come through in a brand new Hellcat, I had 'em hatin' hard
You ain't got no haters you ain't poppin', keep 'em on they job
Came up in the trenches with them hustlers, I ain't have no job

[Chorus]
They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk
2018, it came with auto-park
Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars
Never leave my niggas , I love all of y'all
Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar
Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt
I didn't have a car, I used to walk far
Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

[Outro]
Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar
Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar
Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar
I don't go on dates, we fuckin' right now
Bitch never forget that I'm a trap star
I'm a trap star
I'm a trap star
I'm a trap star




 [Chorus]
I'm trending, I'm trending
Shootin' dice, shirt off in the middle of Memphis, of Memphis
I know them niggas hitters so all the sticks came with me, with me
Shootin' ceelo, fucked around, won a fifty, a fifty
It was me and C-Bo, Z-Bo gettin' busy, busy
Niggas screaming they don't like me
Fuck them niggas, we can get it, get it
Nigga shot at the Sprinter, not a shot didn't even hit it, hit it
Soon as we find out who did it, he gon' come up missin', missin'
Go against me, lose your life, this shit can get risky, risky

[Verse 1]
Ah shit, ah shit
I'm in the booth with a carbon
Niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me
See them niggas, they keep walkin'
I'm with my dogs, they barking
Any problems, then they sparking
We was posted up on Spark
Tryna get it in the dark
Nigga we gettin' it, we gettin'
I fuck with Yo Gotti and Dolph so this shit ain't my business, my business
You need a pack and the money good, I'ma send it, send it
My youngins shootin' shit, they don't give a fuck, they ign'ant, they ign'ant
I ain't goin' back and forth, a nigga better not diss me
I did my time on my own
Stood up like a man and claimed that shit
Every time I turn around, a pussy nigga got my name in shit
I bust it down with my niggas, I do my show with my glizzy
Fuckin' other niggas' bitches, Hi-Tech on me, I been sippin'
They just keep on takin' pictures, they know me

[Chorus]
I'm trending, I'm trending
Shootin' dice, shirt off in the middle of Memphis, of Memphis
I know them niggas hitters so all the sticks came with me, with me

Soon as we find out who did it, he gon' come up missin', missin'
Go against me, lose your life, this shit can get risky, risky

[Verse 2]
I'm in this bitch with Lil Marlo
I'm sippin' syrup by the bottle, yeah yeah
Bitches love me, they gon' follow
They gon' bust it for a dollar, yeah yeah
Zay, that my brother, swear that I love him
Nigga try him, we gon' bust, it get ugly
Me and Big Dre was fucked up together
I found a plug and sent some pounds to the ghetto
I had to sell some bags to make a profit
I get the money, ain't no other option
Ain't cuffin' no bitch, I don't fuck with the coppin'
Get the bag and bust it down with my partners
I'm trending
Built Ford tough, I ain't foldin', I ain't bending, bending
Count the money last night and this shit was a million, million
I had a vision I was gon' be rich
I spent a whole seventy on my wrist
I won't go in if my lil niggas can't get in
They was frontin' on a nigga back then
Now I done fucked her and all of her friends
She'll never give that answer again
They ain't write when I was stuck in the pen
Guess them niggas couldn't find a pen

[Chorus]
I'm trending, I'm trending
Shootin' dice, shirt off in the middle of Memphis, of Memphis
I know them niggas hitters so all the sticks came with me, with me
Shootin' ceelo, fucked around, won a fifty, a fifty

Niggas screaming they don't like me
Fuck them niggas, we can get it, get it
Nigga shot at the Sprinter, not a shot didn't even hit it, hit it

Go against me, lose your life, this shit can get risky, risky




 [Intro: Young Scooter]
Yeah
Yeah Lil Baby
You a real street nigga
You really can't trust these niggas man
Yeah I got 4 Pockets Full too, nigga

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
These niggas ain't real, I don't trust them
All these plugs ain't one hundred, I don't trust them
I got love for my bitch but I don't trust them
All these lawyers play games, I don't trust them
Don't ever put your trust in a fake nigga
Don't ever put your trust in a fake bitch
So it ain't 'bout that money, it's irrelevant
4 Pockets Full, me and Lil Baby filthy rich

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Me and Black Amigo Scooter on the backstreets servin'
I ain't never had a job but I'm always working
I just sold a thousand pounds, man my week went perfect
I can't trust you pussy niggas 'cause I know y'all lurking
My lawyers sold me out so I can't trust them
My nigga Long kept it solid, gotta trust him
Paper, paper, paper, that's the only option
That money on me nigga, ask your bitch I got it
Hundred thousand all hundreds stuffed in all my pockets
I ain't got no fuckin' license, I don't plan on stopping
Got the gang in this bitch, who the fuck gon' stop me?
I'm the topic of discussion, all these bitches talkin'

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
These niggas ain't real, I don't trust them
All these plugs ain't one hundred, I don't trust them
I got love for my bitch but I don't trust them
All these lawyers play games, I don't trust them
Don't ever put your trust in a fake nigga
Don't ever put your trust in a fake bitch
So it ain't 'bout that money, it's irrelevant
4 Pockets Full, me and Lil Baby filthy rich

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Me and Lil Baby cocaine crazy
Jugg king, an 80's baby
4 Pockets Full with dead presidents, that's on the daily
We don't trust these lawyers, they tried to play me
I don't trust these plugs, they snitchin' daily
A nigga text my phone 'bout some bricks, boy you talkin' crazy
Young Scooter, I'm a trap scholar, just like Teezy Dollar
You a broke boy with no hustle, waitin' on your partner
I'm the boss man of my hood but I ain't the only boss
Real street nigga, I always watch out for the triple cross
You got caught with ten bricks and you snitched then that's a double loss
We remixed the weed and sent it back like we couldn't get it off
You shouldn't trust your jeweler nigga, take that fake ass jewelry off
A hundred mil in five years nigga, watch how I pull it off
Scooter!

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
These niggas ain't real, I don't trust them
All these plugs ain't one hundred, I don't trust them
I got love for my bitch but I don't trust them
All these lawyers play games, I don't trust them
Don't ever put your trust in a fake nigga
Don't ever put your trust in a fake bitch
So it ain't 'bout that money, it's irrelevant
4 Pockets Full, me and Lil Baby filthy rich




 [Intro: Lil Baby]
I been tourin'
Can't get to me
They can't get to me

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I'm tryna stack up and get it
I went from rags to riches
I blow the bag in Lenox
I heard your Jag was rented
I know you mad, admit it
Jump in that Lam and hit it
When I put that shit on I be drippin'
I fuck the baddest bitches
Bend that shit over, let me hit from the back
She got some good head, I'ma send her to Saks
Bitch I'm a dog and I'm killin' the cat
And I'm a slime, bitch you better free Yak
You niggas don't talk, boy you better relax
I make a call, get you beat with a bat
Get your shit popped like the top of a gnat
I got the cheese and you niggas is rats

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
And I left the hood broke, came back in a Murciélago
I might fuck on your daughter, I used to ride on MARTA
Bitch know I'm a player, I coach the team like Coach Carter
She tried to take me to Maury, no bitch I'm not the father
All of these bitches they know that we get it
Takin' them private flights city to city
The shit that they doin', we already did it
Never been losin', we already winning
Coupe fully loaded, it's already tinted
[?] off the lot, leave the top with the dealer
I'm not a rapper, bitch I am a dealer
They can't get to me 'cause I'm in the middle

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
We ain't got no money problems, we ain't got no money problems
I told 'em put me in the game coach, I'm a starter
And if she actin' like she need me I'ma starve her
Remember days ridin' on MARTA
But now we flyin' private jets to different cities
And I keep a bad bitch with me
Two chains everywhere like Tity, I done growed up
Bad bitches askin' where the weed, it's time to roll up

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems




 [Verse 1: LavishTheMdk]
Gotta let 'em know I'm here
Gotta know my vision clear
I ain't waiting on niggas, they would've left me in the rear
Only God know what's up with me, the only one I fear
I made a dub last year and blew that money on some gear, forreal
You know we cut different grew up runnin' round the ville
In love with that money, the money give me a thrill
In love with your honey, she cummin' for me forreal
Told her keep her mouth closed cause that's that shit that get you killed
Can't fall nigga, I'm a dawg nigga
Everytime I get that chance you know I'ma ball nigga
And if I can't get my dawg up then I'ma fall with 'em
Know it wouldn't even feel right if Ion't ball with 'em
Why these niggas keep on bendin' and foldin'?
Everytime a nigga winnin' they holdin'
They don't wanna see me up, they just wanna see me stuck
I got endurance for the money I be runnin' that shit up
All I ever did was showed love
Guess that shit there just wasn't enough
Funny how these niggas switchin' up
I thought you was suppose to be my fam, damn
No and I wasn't surprised but it's straight now I just see you can't be one of them guys
All I see is dollar signs when I close my eyes
Every nigga claim they real but they just livin' a lie

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
They don't wanna see me win, they wanna see me bend
They don't want me in that Benz they want me walkin'
Gave them niggas my all when I ain't have too
I swear I gotta take off nigga I'm past due
Lately I been really feelin' like I really deserve this
All the shit we been through I just hope it was worth it
Fold up up sticks we don't come out at play time
Only time I get to see my son is on FaceTime
I been goin' through some shit lately
Wonderin' why these pussy niggas hate me
I'm the same nigga from the block that tried to save 'em
We been runnin' since a jit man I damn near raised 'em
Thinkin' should we go and get them sticks and erase 'em
Watch my man fold in the jam like some paper
I'm just tryna chase my dreams, get my weight up
We was broke we couldn't sleep we just stayed up
Runnin' from them laws on a daily basis
I just pray to God when I wake up Ion't catch no cases
We got dirty K's on the block
They don't want a nigga to pop
They ain't never gon' stop
I'ma keep gettin' this paper
Ain't gon' waiver
I love her but I won't save her
I be damned if I chase her
