 [Hook]
Audi, Bimmer, Benz with the roof up
Still on this goop punch, three gram, boof blunt

Called up some hoes, "Let's go to Lenox Square"
Might just go icey my wrist, might just go cop me some squares
Keep a small circle, I can't fuck with squares

Walk around with them bills
Walk around with them bills (yah)

Hittin' on this thot, and I know I do
Hittin' on this thot, and I know I do

Money jumpin' out the building like a bitch

[Outro]
Ooh
My stummy hurt, my stummy hurt
My stummy hurt (ehh), my stummy hurt




 [Verse: Playboi Carti]
No ventilation, hoes stimulating on this novacane I'm making
Still searching for the one we in the Martrix
Words from the sea ?
Never gave a fuck about the ?
Muscle arms, muscle arms cooking up with baking soda
God never let my enemies get between insanity and Hova
Turning clouds into castles ? slow cameras roll
These bitches listen to us like we got mind control
Overdose my high nigga, I'm flying
By the jets shout out the sky nigga, I'm dying
I take a pound and break it down into a baby bud
Roll up a spliff, then I light it up, now take a puff
It takes concentration when I'm blazing on this elevation
Now treat your hate with my herbal medication
Yeah nigga, ?

[Outro: Sample from Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]
You smoking reefers?
Yeah of course we are, can't you smell it?
No Sam. I can't
Come on Dewey! Join the party!
No Dewey! You don't want this. Get outta here!
You know what I don't want no hangover, I can't get no hangover
It doesn't give you a hangover!
Well, I get addicted to it or something?
Its not habit forming
I don't wanna, overdose on it
You can't OD on it!
It's not gonna make me wanna have sex is it?
It makes sex even better
Sounds kinda expensive
Its the cheapest drug there is

Them bitches sleepy, them bitches dozed off
I put a ring on it, it ain't got a ring to it
On my knees for you, watch me do how he ain't do it

Girl I ain't seen beauty, not 'til I seen you
Don't you cheat like Queen do

Let me sing to you, let this be the theme music

Mr. Never Lacking, bust a package
Bills can get paid off of rappin', still I keep to trappin'
Used to hunnid sack it, now I fuck an actress
Shit, I'm just thinkin' how it happened
Had to get explicit, had to make 'em listen
Moving out them pounds, niggas started snitchin'
Loading up them rounds, niggas started missin'
Move it out of town, and Tommy Cruise the mission
Converse with my addictions, don't talk I just listen
Five drugs that I'm mixin', money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semi's and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits
Like grandma TV, we been with the static
I fuck on this bitch and she say she from Athens
Opiated so I'm demonstratin' my emotion less
Got some real niggas quotin' this, got yo' main bitch hoein shit
Lost a few things as of recent, life is anything but decent
Blow the re-up on my teeth
It's the only time you catch me cheesin'
It's Dolla

Shipping a pack and it's vacuum sealed

Just bought a pint, I'm a crack the seal
Strap on my side like a Navy SEAL
Three in the morning, we trapping still
Matte black on rover, the Batmobile
Don’t trust that nigga cause he gon squeal
Not buying shit if the pack not sealed
I'm faded, I’m faded, off xannies I’m wasted
My bitches they nasty, they suck it and taste it
I’m short on my patience, I’m serving my patient
I’m very impatient, little bitch come get naked
Pack coming in but I don’t need to weigh it
Choppa en route, I shoot once and you spraying
Can’t come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Dripping through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot cause she heard me on the radio
3 bitches, one of me, that's a perfect ratio
Don’t wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her booty hole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, backwoods, riding 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to po'
Hit a stain, hogging lanes, gripping grain, getting throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred when you see me, Imma let it go
No mo' 'gars so we rolling up the fronto
No mo 'gars cause we rollin out the fronto
I'm in H-town, nigga, and I can never go

[Hook: Playboi Carti]

Right hand, cook motion

Cigarettes and violence
Chillin' with my Tec, bruh

Theses hoes on these beans
And they all caught that from me
Young Carti, I’m a G
Respected in the streets
Kilos from off the beach
Banana Boat, chillin' with the heat
Yo' hoe got cheeks
Sapphire theses diamonds
Chanel leggings her ass
This what I got from rhyming
Cars, clothes and cash
But that's something I been had
But that's something you don't know
Ever since I was a kid I knew that money was the move
All black wrist with the ice on it
Cut food ice, put the syrup on it
And that bitch top me off with the condom on it
She a good girl, I got a lot of money
Cold blows on these niggas
My chin like fourteen figures
My neck can't hold it either
Your cheque can't hold her either
Nigga, that’s a two seater
Rollin’ up that illegal
[?] feel from that litre, I'm faded
She undressin’ for a impression
My suggestion is that you come towards my direction
And catch some of this lesson
Water in my glass hoe, chillin' like I should doe (Carti)
Won't catch me in the club (club), making it rain
For these broke hoes (hell no), that's a no no (hell no)
Catch me when them clouds come from [?], hoe (Ayy)
Catch me when them clouds come from [?], hoe (Bitch)
Catch me when them clouds come from [?], hoe
Bitch, all you niggas bitches

[Outro]
Get down, in her nightgown
She get down (Shake that ass)
Ass out, Louis pouch
Filled with loud, she hold dope (That dope)
Before we fuck we smoke (We smoke, yeah)
Relax your mind
Open your legs wide, close the bush
I’m on cloud 9 the way I hit it from behind (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

 [Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
New choppa, new choppa it came with the beam
Actavis pouring up lean

All of these knots on my jeans, Alexander of McQueen
Diamonds they lookin' like ice, I whip the hoe like I'm Ike
Stack up my cash I got height, take advantage of the Sprite

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a chopper chop you if you try me bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this", that's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being bougie by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks, for the most part
"I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP and I ain't wanna rush

[Hook: Playboi Carti + A$AP Rocky]
Run it up, run it up, run it up

Feel like 2Pac, got the juice
Feel like 2Pac, got the juice
First I go call up the troops
We run it up like we do
Bitch I go cop me a coupe
Bitch I go cop me a booth
Then I go swool with the loot
Put that lil bih on her back
Told that lil bih to relax
Tell that lil bih I got back
Told that bih I got stacks
Hollup lil bih, that's lil cash
Spend a lil check on the rent
Spend a lil' check on the brick
She got the cake in the back
I got the K in the back
I got my face in the sack
Hit your block hard like some crack
I told that lil' nigga we back
I told that bih we got back
I told that lil' nigga we back
Who that boy there with the bag?
Who that bitch there with the ass?
I sip the lean and the gas
I keep that shit in the back
For that lil' work, bitch I tax
For that lil' verse, bitch I tax
All of these hoes, they attached
Fuckin' your bitch, that's some facts
Half of these niggas, they rats
Half of these niggas, they rats
Hit your block hard with the Gat
Hit your block hard like some crack

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Ayy, bitch I came up sellin' crack
Wasn't no sleep, I was up with the night owls
Some my niggas was there but ain't no more
Capo said he’ll vouch for it right now
Switchin' shifts from the alley to corner
See them cops at the block and yell right out
We don't put in, we out here with two jobs
You ain't trappin', you best have that pipe out
40 Glock with the stick and the light out
Roll the window down, stick this bitch right out
Nigga talkin' like he sick in this cold world
It's our shit up in here, take 'em right out
Internet got the world tryna fight now
All these tweets get a fuck nigga hype now
Disrespect me, I'll go to you right now
With these rhymes that I got, put you right down
And I will beat you up 'cause I know how
Lay a fuck nigga out if I like how
Livin' nights on that block, I couldn't lie down
Interrogations and I'll put that lie down
Still keep them choppers where we go
Still keep that fuego from migo
And I cannot fuck with no googoos
We treat the Rudys like Renos
Still don’t catch me with no Bru Brus
Still rock Balmain with my new trues
G Herbo ain't no goody two shoes
Still'll do you 'cause I got some loose screws
Takin' trips outta town with my boo boo
Might skeet off right past you in the new coupe
She got weave in her hair and it's too loose
Got a Bs in the air, throw a soo-woo
Hit a lick like Ace Boogie with Lulu
Then I might buy her a poodle
And I might buy her a deuce deuce
Just in case she with me when I shoot you

[Outro: G Herbo]
Ayy, G Swervo
Yeah, deuce, deuce
Fuck up your life like some voodoo
Carti with me too
I got Carti with me too
You ain’t part of what we do

Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot

 [Hook Playboi Carti]

Walk inside Phipps and I spend a lil' time (hoe)
Designer frames, Gucci on my collar like a slime (hoe)
And I got a lot of tools, fuck you niggas (fuck parole)

I just turned a virgin bitch into a hoe (what what)
Designer steppin', baby we just countin' dough

[Verse Playboi Carti]
I was in Bankhead now I'm in Buckhead
Bitches want my cheese, want my bread, come get fed
Used to rock with Jess, used to rock with Glenn
Used to rock with Kiki, now I'll smash her friend
Running up the check
Hoe I like to eat eat

All my hoes a fefe might just smash a twin
Came out the pen with 100 in my pants

[Hook Playboi Carti]
I woke up with my jewelry on and sleeping with my .9 (woah)

 [Intro]
Shawty suck my dick in the bathroom
Then she popped a xanny in the bathroom
That's what them racks do
I'm movin' packs too
Nigga come through I'm boomin' in the drive thru

I'm off the dope shit, I'm off my mind
She tryna kick it, I'm never off my grind boy that's mine

[Verse]
Catch me flippin' plays all the time

Bad yellow bone stay blowin' my line

I just went inside of Phipps and spent on Tom Ford
Shawty suck my dick in the bathroom

 [Verse]
Juggin' and finessin', fuck that bitch, leave her abandoned
Trap house be abandoned, posted with my bandits
Lame niggas can't stand me, diamonds on me dancin'
Tell me who the man is, tell me who the man is
Bricks on the floor, cameras in the room
Two cups, styrofoam, bitch I'm on the moon
Keep the chopper on me, when I'm on the move
Money in my trues, and these bitches on me choosin'
I been on my shit, you can ask your bitch
I been on my shit, you can ask your bitch
All these hoes you wanna fuck, they been on my dick
All these hoes you wanna fuck, they been on this shit
Word around town, young Carti on his shit
I had to jugg that nigga cuz' he wasn't with the shits
Niggas talkin' drugs, he ain't never seen them bricks
I'm probably in South Fulton keeping that muhfucka lit
Cops come, track meet, we all split
If a nigga get caught, I don't know shit
I can't tell a soul, I'm on my own shit
Ya buddy unfamiliar, I don't know him

You say you counted seven stacks but I done spended that
Don't hit my line with all that hot shit just say that I need that

And if you push me to the limit, you'll regret that
Compared to mine, some diamonds in your mouth look like some plaque
Final Fantasy, I'm savin' clouds like I am zack
Can't be no trendy nigga because that shit so wack
Chattanooga Tennessee where I spent my summers at
Lived in the city, lived in the suburbs
Burnin' purp, burnin' bands, burnin' rubber
Gettin' more green gettin' flubber
Gettin' more green gettin' flubber
All these unfamiliars round me always lookin' at
Is it cause the chick I'm with you probably thought you had?
Lookin' fabolous when I jug you just throw it in the bag

She can't wear no leggings around me, boy, I don't like that
Took his bitch with my wrist, he ain't like that
Loud pack, rollin' on my iPad
These Versace shades, I can't see that
All white bricks, all white bricks, my Chanel bag
I'm just life for life
I still took that flight
Fucked her the first night
Syrup sit on ice
