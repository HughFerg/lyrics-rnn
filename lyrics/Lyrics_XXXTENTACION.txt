 [Speech: XXXTentacion]
Okay, so it's recording, it's recording now.
It's 8:31 AM and I am currently talking to my laptop and I don't exactly know how to have a conversation with my laptop while I'm by myself
So this is gonna be, um how do you call it, a try?
Um, so here we go.
So I'm pretty sure we have a lot of SoundCloud fans that actually don't have a Twitter, Tumblr, or an Instagram or anything such as that.
Cause I'm sure that a lot of you just discovered my music through SoundCloud and probably don't know how to get in contact with me.
So here's how we're gonna, here's how we're gonna keep in contact for those of you that actually, like diehard fans.
Cause I'm pretty sure a lot of our diehard fans don't have the main social networks.
So what I want you guys to do is either download Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even Snapchat.
And I'm gonna give you each of my names and I'm gonna put em in the, in the description and I'm gonna put my partners' names and I'm gonna, like different, different people that I'm working with
or whatever you guys want from me.
I'm gonna start answering questions through Tumblr so if you wanna get in contact with me to have a conversation, you're gonna contact me through Tumblr.
If you want to, I mean just look at what the fuck I'm thinking and have a comment on what I'm thinking, that would usually be on Twitter.
Um, Instagram obviously is just, just photos
I mean the extent to it's just a DM, I see pretty much where I check is the DM's is why I go on Instagram. So if you wanna get in contact with me, again, Instagram.
My, I'll give you contact to my manager so that way you can contact my managers easier if you have a line of business that you want to contact me for. Please only contact if it is for business.
What, I mean as far as the shows we have, what's the shows we have coming up?
We have one in West Palm, West Palm Beach on Friday with Wifisfuneral.
And then I have a, I have a show with my partner the day after and also with my partner Pollari, Kevin Pollari.
I mean if you wanna come to those shows, those are the dates.
Friday, West Palm Beach, myself and Wifisfuneral.
And Saturday, I'll be attending my partner's show in, what is it, Miami?
Well, so yeah it's in Wynwood, Miami.
So what I need you guys to do is go on our social networks and follow us.
So for Twitter, my social network name would be what my artist name is on SoundCloud.
X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N
For, I'll give you Instagram, for Instagram: heroinfather, H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
For Snapchat, theheroinfather, T-H-E-H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
Tumblr, xxxtentacion.tumblr.com, so X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N, dot tumblr, T-U-M-B-L-R, dot com.
And, um, I'm pretty sure that'd be it.
Alright, well, on a different note, here's what I'll cover. We'll call it "a helping hand."
Damn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.
For those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?
A little bit not in tune with what's going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like you're just following whatever is right in front of you
Here's what I call a helping hand, here's how I'll help you do it:
With whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.
So say for instance you see money in your life and that's what you want more of.
The more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.
People think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.
Or these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but it's literally what it is.
So, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.
The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.
And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.
[glitch]
Woah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didn't pause.
Yeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.
Whatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?
What you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.
So if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.
There's no simpler way-holy shit.
Shouts out to Teflon Sean.
You need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.
But yeah, also, study the Golden Beetle.
With that being said, goodbye.




 [Intro]
There was blood in my tears
"I don’t know why you’re doing it but it’s not good and it’s not healthy- it’s not right."
I heard so many complaints to remember
"Not that I’m saying you don’t have it together, I’m sure you do. You’re a genius, you really are."
I will never change
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Break!
Yeah (she said, she said)
Yeah

[Verse]
If the seasons change
Will you remain the same?
Oh, how I love the cold
Because of you I'll never know
Gold teeth in a flask (yeah)
Many men without a soul
But the fall is all we know, yeah it's all we know
I look forward to the ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Break
I will never change, I will never break, yeah
Break, yeah

Please, I don't wanna be alone (be alone)
Please, I don't wanna be alone (wanna be alone, wanna be alone)
Yeah
"...a genius"
"I know"




 [Intro]
I've had enough of this, goodbye

[Hook]
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim

[Verse 1]
I woke up with the knife in my hand, aye, aye
To murder the bitch was the plan, aye, aye
I will never salvage, feelings are abundant
Many men are of a dying breed
Plunge a knife into his throat
And suck the blood of human out in case it's dangerous

[Verse 2]
I observe the father, walk into an alley
Probably going just to take a piss
Slowly, surely, I will take position
Without hesitation, I will grab his wrists
Chop him, buck him, fuck him
I will stab him, splat him, drag his body all across the map
Shower in his fluids, kiss him, bite him, eat him
Threw a fit, and then I take a nap

[Bridge]
Butterflies, kidney stones
Slit wrists, vagabond
Concubine, I'm alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Butterflies, kidney stones
Slit wrists, vagabond
Concubine, I'm alone
Very holy when I'm not alone

[Outro]
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone

Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone




 [Intro]
I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over

[Verse]
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?

[Outro]
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth




 [Verse]
I dream so much
And I just can't seem to find an answer
To what I'm living for, in general
I can't keep living like this
It's breaking my heart, day by day
I mean, who's to say...
Who's to say you find an answer when there isn't?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a dream?
What if we live for no reason?
What if you just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplations
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please, save me




 [Verse]
Said you wanna take my bitch, no way
Yeah you silly damn I'm pissed, yeah
Really might fuck your bitch
Fuck her right and I fucking money dance in her clit

Get your skeet for the night, just might
Mix lean with the sprite, just might
Get your skeet for the night, just might

Got all these slits upon my wrist like Amy Winehouse
Who gon' fuck me, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I don't get mad, no more
I just fuck harder and harder and

I just fuck harder and harder and
I don't get mad, no more
I just fuck harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and

[Outro]
God damn

[Verse]
Tempo changed, trapped in the rain
Slide on my sidekick rusts anyway
I been feeling lost in the dirt, I stray
Running from the man with the blade, I say
Look in the mirror doesn't feel any better
Magazine covers see my mama had better
Treatments cease and it don't fuckin' matter
Big foot, big foot stomped in bones shatter
Feeling like Vader, wrist dimensions
Skinny white bitches always geeked in my mentions
Put your fucking mouth on the curb, shove him in it
Bitch tryna have me suicidal, Sean Kingston
NASCAR cap put a strap to his back
Brass knuckles on my hand so I can't call back
Feeling like mean billionaire boy brand
Fuck a gun, grab a blade and your throat cut back

Blasted, blasted, want the pressure-pressure
Among the lord, succumb to me under pressure, aye
Brace
Look at the slits on my wrist
Look at the blood in my piss
Cold as my heart
Tend to get better at this
By the time when I wasn't just
Cold from the start
Grabbin' the K with intentions
You bust it, but niggas be jumpin'
And plus if you add it up, add it up, put it up in your heart
Pussy might find your heart

She sucking it sloppy, aye (Doomsday)
Nigga don't want no stress

Itty bitty nigga wanna pull up on a nigga
Let the shit go bang, bang
I'm aiming it straight for your brain
A few of my niggas that fuck with the figures
That pull up with guns and just slay
Xanny clouds make her aroused
She wanna pop an Adderall
Put her on the Molly
"You can fuck my head"
Get it Jah

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Fake hoe, snake hoe
Mad 'cause my case closed
Put me in a cape, and I still won't fucking save a hoe
Captain save a hoe, you a captain save a hoe
Captain save a hoe, you a captain save a hoe

[Verse 2: ZiLLA]

Don’t ring around me, shits platinum

Fuck the jaw and the neck crack

Stepped on you with the whole map

Sucked me up, then I booled back

 [Intro: Shiloh Dynasty & XXXTENTACION]
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back down

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused
Was used and misled
Bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my…
Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head I see your face
I fuckin' hate that I love you still, yeah

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty & XXXTENTACION]
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you fucked up bad




 [Verse 1]
She came to fuck, it was picture perfect
Different person when she texting, guess her heart was hurting
She need attention I'm guessing I didn't get the message
She told me "Bae, I know you miss me, why you still pretending?"
Louie loafers, Fendi, and different colors matching
She leave her house like she winning a fucking beauty pageant
And when she older, she told me she wanted to be an actress
Keep that spray in that condo in case a nigga actin'
She got some issues she told me her daddy beat her 50
And she tried to do stripping but I guess it wasn't fittin'
Now she fucks with these fuckers, she just want the dollar bills
Fuck it when this shit is real, bitch you know it's real
Yeah, never caught them to save a ten
Another day inside a court like it's a fucking journey
Damn, call Diamond, Downy and Guapo
20 and that Henny in case a nigga could Chapo
They like Similac and milk in that baby bottle
Bumpin' that Metro Boomin say "fuck it" just let the shots roll
Fuck it just let the shots roll

[Verse 2]
Momma wouldn't stand that baby going to jail
Momma always wanted her baby going to Yale
40 in that fanny she hit me straight for ya tail
She don't need a tutor for paying the baby bail
Yeah, why selling the MacBook
Better tuck his chain if the nigga don't want his neck took
And for all my niggas who chilling who have my back bruh
Sitting with that fanny just waiting for you to act up
Fuck it just let the shots roll
Tired of these bitches and nigga do want the top though
Catch a nigga slipping and nigga it ain't even my dough
Nigga talking funny, said "fuck it" just left his jaw broke
Case it, I law and order
Tell you a nigga like you never fuck with my daughter
Nino on the Yachty, that honor bitty my side(y)
Homie fuck the rapping, we pulling up with the shotty
Yeah, aye rock like Biggie and Pac did
Tell you what that Nina with Rio, Bria in Bel-Air
Always miss my uncle, a gamble just like casinos
Lately I been chilling, I been chilling, I hit up my nigga Chino
Hush, fuck it just let the shots roll
Looking like Khalifa and Yeezy mixed with a Pac, oh
"Who you favorite artist?" I tell these niggas "I don't know"
Bitch you love my music so where the pussy and guapo

[Outro]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

 [Verse]
I regained the breathe of the last man
I'm so relaxed soon we are the blessed one
I will recollect the body manifest
And puff a cigarette, six sicker
Body flip 'em wrists, who could give a shit
If mama showed how the fuck it's done
Lost friend feelin' shitty, called pissy sissy
Broad feelin' like death or when I'm ready

[Sample]

[Hook]
Bullets like confetti
Ax to the brain
Drugs for the pain
How you feel the same love?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slipknot
Then we hang
Pretty pushy broad
Make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch

[Break]

[Sample]

[Hook]
Bullets like confetti
Ax to the brain
Drugs for the pain
How you feel the same ma?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slit
Knot then we hang
Pretty pushy broad
Make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch




 [Verse]
Sever her bonds, you take the wheel, I lost control, ayy
She did it all for some clarification that you never know, ayy
Give it a rest, best, chest it off of the what these sacrifice of us
Clarity so where is the fairer few
Will never be free of this
So I pay the fucker repent
Trifle for the foolish will not give me bank
I fucked the face of the few I resent
I flee the life without doubt in my head

[Hook]
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all from some clarity
She did it all from some clarity
She did it all from some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
She did it all from some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If i am alone she is my God




 [Verse]
Pussy in the bank, 4 o'clock
Loaded glock, I can never lay

Okay shorty, I can't trust no bitch
How do your gang? fuck your feelings

 [Intro]
Sodomize her, aye
I’m your pusha man
Cocaine, cocaine

[Verse]
Into the depths of the dark
Fear will swallow your heart
Blood shed in the shed

Fuck a juice, lose a tooth

Drilling through his head

Murderer rigorous
Hershel smoking his purple straight to the face
Bullets on bullets

Pull up on niggas

Titled immunity
Fold her lil sin as we live on the limb
Fuck her, I die
Preach up on the sin
Life ain't shit
Fuck bitches in the bin

 [Verse]
Dead inside
Spend a lot of time stuck in this head of mine
Under the assumption love is dead, already
Just let me be here
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands, at night?
Seen the vivid pictures in my head, at night
It left me in tears
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands?
Seen the vivid pictures in my head
I'm under the assumption love is dead
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands?
I’m under the assumption love is dead
Seen the vivid pictures in my head

See me, Hip-Hop's a jungle
I'm deep, see

[Verse 1]
It's the revenge of the bitch
She catch attention and intervention and shit
She got your penchant tattooed to the brim
That bitch looser than the screws in my noogin and shit
She'll take your mula, pop medulla, get to suckin' and shit
Wifin' the bitch, mistakes push brigade out of they mama
Doing her braids, living with mama for the rest of the days
Ain't seen the space, shit, a young Dracula
Fucking all the homies, bet her pussy feel spectacular
She gon' stunt in these shades and buy a thousand dollar lipstick
Ever had a motherfuckin' thousand dollar dick kiss?
Well I did, Hi kids that she swallowed, head hollow, no brain, go insane
But she gon' stunt, In this letterman, in my letterman, in my letterman

[Interlude]
See, haha
Hip-Hop's a jungle, nah

[Verse 2]
You see my raps became subordinate
Posting portraits of flow and gin
More the note of the porridge
Than more annoyed than an ordin
More annoyed than an orphan
From (?) who's off of morphine
And snorting some black detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexis open for fucking
Fuck it I’m ducking, and jumping off to New Zealand
I’m wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pillin I’m feeling like villain
Haha

Ah, fuck your feelings, young nigga

Rest in peace to your mama, with the drumma, ha

[Verse: Anneka]
I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt; and what for?
Going to be covered in dust
You came all this way for a door
Watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All and nothing aren't the same score

I thought you got all you came for

O-oh. o-oh. o-oh. o-oh

Shut her down
Going to take you outside
Sifting up a reason from the lonely
When it's over you'll be golden
Over. over

Shut you down
Going to take you outside
Sucking up the dust from your static
Just the time away you'll be golden
Over. over

I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone
Overdone

Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonne be right tis time?
Right
O-oh. o-oh. o-oh

I think you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

I thought you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone
Overdone

Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

Easy is overdone
Overdone
Easy is overdone
Overdone
Easy is overdone
Overdone
Easy is overdone

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic

Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch amassed with the pack, no trap lord
Menacing vainness, turn yo bitch up into a lost cause
"Beauty and the Beast" with the clip, be cautious
Caution, I murder the pussy, I’m steady flossin'
Aww shit, I leave ‘em corpses, I metamorphous
I’m fancy, lodge ya head in the window of Porsches
Cordless got an abortion
Slide in the pussy with Ritalin and abort it
Laughin, I leave the masses straight gaspin
Caskets preachin a murder so light yo matches
Nasty tone with a nasty poem
Pretty kitty, dirty vagabond
Tragic, sacrificing sanity for vastness
Belittling vanity, insanity what we castin'
Half-wet, I leave him half-alive in the basket
And if you not a savage, succumb to the madness

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Nigga what'cha really know about me? ('bout me)
I’m on yo bitch like clothes, no closet (no closet)
Why you worried ‘bout the money I deposit? (I deposit)

Nigga whatcha really know about me? (god damn)
I’m on yo bitch like clothes, no closet (what?)
Why you worried ‘bout the money I deposit? (what?)
I’m in her mouth like water, no faucet (ok, ok)
Nigga what'cha really know about me? ('bout me)
I’m on yo bitch like clothes, no closet (no closet)
Why you worried ‘bout the money I deposit? (I deposit)
I’m in her mouth like water, no faucet (ok, ok)

Come up out the pussy like a fade away
Watch me beat the kitty, Ryu

[Verse: Sully the Chief God]
I put the gun on the table
You think your life is unstable?
You try to beat me, you're unable
These bitches watch me like cable
I put my hand on the bible
These thoughts are suicidal
But my life is so fuckin' vital
The world is my rival
Said the world is my rival

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I bought Versace from a thrift store
I don't even want your whore

 [Intro: XXXTENTACION]
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is....
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
And I, could’ve been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And I, could’ve been
Dead, boy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
Just face the abyss, and I (aye!)
Place blame for this shit
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist, wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that’s the gist
Flushed, you can see it on me, I'm pissed, pissed
Lost in the mist, pants full of piss
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick, brick

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (ay, ay, ay)
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (ay ay, ay ay)

[Outro: XXXTENTACION & Bones]
Living a farce
Living a farce, living a farce
Living a farce
Living a farce, living a farce
I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Return of the X and the slashin'
Couldn't be, wouldn't be, slits on my wrist for you destiny
Blade's to the Xans for reactions, Catholics
Listen social compassion, rape
Laced with vasses , blast to be casket
Hustlin in the hood, always zen for a capture
Facebook caption, blast to the magic
Tell a fuck nigga that I hate him with a passion

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost

I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell

[Verse 2: Nyora Spouse]
Got drugs, mothafucka, laugh like Chris Tucker
All these hatin' ass suckas, never loved by their mothers
Nine lives and you pussy
My main bitch married, my side ho loose
Stupid ass niggas think that they shook me
But I got the MAC and I'm bigger than they could be
Stackin' my bread like loafs
She listen to me and that bitch soak
Flexin', stuntin', bitch I gloat
Off that cake and bitch I float
You sensitive fuck, get the fuck out my face
I'm makin' these moves and I come in first place
I'm stackin' my cash, I got my own place
Play with me, straight bust to the face

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell
Ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost
I'd rather be ghost in the shell

 [Intro: Donald Trump]
—ference, but a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration.  And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville. So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thank—

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false loves, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart has gone as still as a corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false loves, I pray the cement
Will fuckin' swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart has gone as still as a corpse

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Donald Trump]
Why the fuck should I apologize?
Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
And where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?


[Outro: Donald Trump]
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.  What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.  No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society.  And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play




 [Chorus]
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice

[Bridge]
Ooh, you're poison
Poison, filled with poison
Fill my veins with poison
Poison, filled with poison

[Chorus]
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice
Hearteater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Hearteater, try but you will not suffice

 [Intro: Xxxtentacion]
You're gonna endlessly chase her
You're either gonna get frustrated and be like:
"uhhh fuck that bitch, dadaada"
Or you're endlessly gonna chase her
Because you're never gonna get what you want

[Verse: Heldrish]
Waiting on you, hard to find
Different times, different words
Waiting on you to be mine
You don't know, valentine
I tell myself "not again"
I think too much, dream so much

Help me




 [Intro: SZA]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

[Verse 1: SZA]
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me
To think I had it...
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I he-hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breathe-breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming
Just do it
Ye-yeah yeah, I hear you talking
Ye-yeah yeah, feel you moving
Let's do it,  yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

[Verse 2: SZA & XXXTENTACION]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me
Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self-infliction
Blood stains at my girl place, without a soul, impure hate
Insecure ay, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine
History, mystery, hate her, fuck him
What's mint to me?
Was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt
Ice Hotel

[Bridge: XXXTentacion]
Chances, chances, chances
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice
Ice

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Feel the love in the air
Hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, legislate for eight
Seven virgins
Swerve and converge
Her rapes lurking, curtain
Covered sins soon rest unwritten
Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel

[Verse 1: Carlos Andrez]
Mamita, vente, olvida la gente
Sé que tu cuerpo me pide calor
Y sé lo que siente', la noche te prende
No te preocupes, me gustan mayor
Girl, you know you got me feeling you the way you move
Baby, bring you closer and let me show you what to do
Move it side to side, I know you want a drink or two
Let me have your body, let me show what I can do
Mami, eres tú quien me provoca (-a, -a, -a)
Cuando chupa ella sí se pone loca (-a, -a, -a)
Hazlo lento pero quítate la ropa (-a, -a, -a)
Enséñame rodillas y abre boca (-a, -a, -a), ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus: Judah]
Mami, what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby, get your vibe up, pour up another cup
Girl, I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride, I wanna show you love

[Chorus: Judah]
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight (eh)

[Verse 2: Rio Santana]
Got me caught up in the vibe, now mama let's go
I'ma make you shine in the night time (baby)
Rolling with a star, you could be my angel
Just back that booty up at the right time
I can feel you when you dance, you grabbing all on my pants
I'm kissing you in advance, baby, live it up
She putting me in a trance, I'm throwing out all my bands
She yelling that this a jam, DJ, turn it up

[Bridge: Rio Santana]
She want it, she want it
We going hard 'til 6 in the morning
She need it, she need it
I bet the neighbors know my name when she moan it

[Pre-Chorus: Judah]
Mami, what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby, get your vibe up, pour up another cup
Girl, I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride, I wanna show you love

[Chorus: Judah, XXXTENTACION]
Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Girl, I'll have you feeling ri-i-i-i-ight
Maybe only for a ni-i-i-i-ight
Come with me and feel the vi-i-i-i-ibe

Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down
Hold it now the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down

Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight

You think you got a little buzz, so now you can't get stung?
I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (no)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Murder these flows like I murder these hoe ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a hoe, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift
At the publix with like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wan suck up my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why these young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I'll pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Joey Bada$$]
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more (yeah)
I don't feel the pain (ay) no more (ay)




 [Speaking]
Worse thing comes to worst, I fucking die a tragic death or some shit and I’m not able to see out my dreams.
I at least want to know that the kids perceived my message and were able to make something of themselves and able to take my message and use it and turn it into something positive and to a...  to at least have a good life.
I atleast... If I'm gonna'... If I’m gonna' die or ever be a sacrifice, I want to make sure that my life made at least five million kids happy or they found some sort of answers or resolve in my life, regardless of the negative around my name, regardless of the bad things people say to me.
I don’t give a fuck, because I know my goal in the end and I know what I want for everyone, and I know what my message is.
So I just wanted to say I appreciate and love all of you and believe in you all.
Do not let your depression make you.
Do not let your body define your soul.
Let your soul define your body.
Your mind is limitless.
You are worth... You are worth more than you can believe.
All you have to do is dream and all you have to do is want to fulfill that dream and have the strength.




 [Verse]
By my window
Broken glass
No one here knows
My intent
In the end
I won't cry, I won't falter
In the end
I won't run, I won't hide
It's too late
I won't stand by the altar
In the end
I won't run, I won't hide




 [Intro]
Kodak bop on my cock Kodak bop

[Hook]
Walked in this bitch
Dro rolled in this bitch
Sniff coke in this bitch
Clique talk in this bitch
All black in this bitch
Like a goth in this bitch
Slit wrist in this bitch
Grip dick in this bitch

[Verse]
Hopped out I'm grinding my grillz they all shining
Your bitch hit my line cuz my dick perfect size
And your dick shaped like fries lil' boy don't be surprised
When I pull out that Glock and it's hot like a furnace
Post on your block sippin' tea like I'm Kermit
Bullet holes all in your chest I should burn it
Diamonds are wet see the tats on my chest
In a Young Thugger dress all my niggas are VR




 [Intro: Spoken]
To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. Enjoy

 [Intro]
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the sun don't shine
The tears don't show, won't hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I hate myself, but
It won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer,  now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's
Word of a pacifist to war of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to Eden, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"

 [Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty—
I know you so well




 [Intro]
I know you so well so well
I mean I can do anything he can

[Verse1]
Maybe I dont feel okay
Cause everytime i hear your name
It tears me up inside im breaking down
And all those things you used yo say
You loved me on a certain day
Every other time its living hell
You  got your mind all messed up
Feeling low playing rough
Allways to reming me that you re near
Im looking up for guidance
Cloud someone help this violence
I just keep on playing someone hears

[verse2]
I know you so well so well
I mean I can do anything he can

[verse3]
Dont know how to feel now
Say that you need me now
Just to know it I am thinking
So you can control my feelings
Telling me im special
Lost different levels
So i never tell you secrets
Baby I am badly beaten
You are a liar
You hurt with desire
I cloud see it in your eyes
And they never tell me lies
How do i stay strong
Listen for you way too long
Noo..

[Outro]
I know you so well so well
I mean I can do anything he can




 [Verse]
Bitches come and go, that's the way it go
All a nigga need is my dick and dope
She got too excited, had to slap the bitch
R.I.P. to ATL Young Bankroll
Had the dope on me, so I'm jugg walkin
Not equivalent to fucking moon walkin'
Shawty say she like the way I'm jugg walkin'
Nigga run up on me put him in a coffin

[Hook]
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
She like the way I talk, she like the way I walk
She say its really nice, she like my jugg walk
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
She like the way I talk, she like the way I walk
She say its really nice, she like my jugg walk




 [Verse]

It's no wonder why my mother hates me
I beat my dick to porn flicks of Martin Lawrence with autistic babies
Child molestin', incest it wasn't a question
Beat her like-
-- strep
Oh woody, such a big woody
Hey stop touching--
So me and-




 [Verse]
How's it feel? How's it feel with your broken heart?
Can't reveal, can't reveal all these fucking scars
Hurt me now, kill the pain, this is just the start
Kill me now, numb the pain, I just want it to stop
Run away, run away from my broken heart
Kill me now, numb the pain, this is just the start
Run away, run away from my broken heart
Kill me now, numb the pain, this is just the start
Heart broken, no one can feel me
Heart open, with an incision
You broke it, too many faces running
I'm nothing, I'm nothing different




 [Verse]
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
I'm not in love, I won't let you control what I want

[Hook]
Hate me, won't break me, I’m killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I’m killing everyone I love

Ayy, pick up the pace
Tell 'em why I ain’t find no haze
Indeed I am ready, my outfit in vain
The needle in my veins, I'm falling asleep
King of the dead, I sever your head
When shit touch the river my reign will be fed
I touch the sky and bring life to the dead
I watch my demons become Super Saiyan
Oh, I'm not an orphan
Death, is my importance
Rest, without a soul, many will fold
Feeling my bones, I say again
Oh, I'm not an orphan
Death, is my importance
Rest, without a soul, many will fold
Feeling my bones, I say again

[Interlude]
Found this out in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore the song, the more-
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music
It's nice, actually

[Verse 2]
I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
I don't need no fucking help
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
I don't need no fucking help

Found this out in Sweden
The more I explore, the more I fall in love with the music I make

 *UNRELEASED SONG*




 [Intro]
As a fair warning to everyone listening to this song
I advise you to not hide your feelings
Don't pretend to be okay when you're not okay
Don't pretend to be happy when you're sad
It'll only lead to your misery

[Verse]
Don't you fucking hate it when you hear my name?
I feel the same and when you hear this you gon' feel the pain
And all these niggas that you fuckin with to get away
But girl, I know you think about it almost everyday
And I'll be honest, I be jealous of these niggas, true
How you feelin' with these niggas that you talk to?
Captivated by your mind and your walk too
Can't replace you with these bitches that I talk to
This ain't lust, it's love
We had trust, what's good?
I should've held you close
Should've kept you warm
And when the rain is fallin', wonder who you call
Don't pray to god, you'd rather cry than call
Don't jump
Pretend it don't hurt
Repent, I won't stomp my feet in a rage
My nigga, I'm no chump
Need you and I crave you, hate you
Think I ripped the wings off of my fuckin angel
It don't hurt me, damn

[Outro]
W.R.A.C
I'll forever be the, I'll forever be the elephant in the room
I'll always love you

Part 2: Riot

[Intro: Luke White]
Luke White on the beat

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin' fuck it and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman of many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck black prejudice!"
"Let's murder different races, grow hatred and form irrelevant!"
Views and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage em', lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bath in blood of officers', different corpses, offin' 'em, Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say "fuck it" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Equity and equality: the end result we all — the ones that don't want to live in misery, that is — desire.  And naturally we all black and white are schadenfreude or malicious. Here are a few examples

Emmett Till, August 28th, 1955, Mississippi — pulled out of his house in the middle of the night, in front of his mother who had to watch her son be taken from her on the sidelines, for little to no reason at all worth murdering a fourteen-year-old boy.  Castrated, mutilated, but also documented for the years to see

Kori Ali Muhammad, black-on-white. Philando Castile, white-on-black.  Now these things never come to or remotely remain in the public eye. And the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter

I can go on forever about the fact that murder is murder whether you're black or white. You should always feel free to voice your opinion, but to act out on these irrational thoughts in every shape or form is disgusting. You cannot, as black or white, call yourself the supreme race when moved out of your comfort by the opposition's color, their skin color.  That is no form of being or demonstrating being a supreme being

If you are a supremacist, be unmoved by the opposition. Remain unscathed in the comfort of your own home, in your own realm. Demonstrate care for the youth's future, white or black, black or white. Are you willing to risk your child's future due to your own bigotry? The choice is yours, but your child will not stand for the hate. This generation will be loved, nurtured, heard and understood

Can't seem to explain a thing
Going on in my head (on in my head)

Runnin' from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head (thoughts in my head)
Runnin' from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head (thoughts, in my)

[Chorus]
And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
I wept and I'll count the tears I shed (tears I shed, tears I)
She sat there and watched as I bled

As I bled, as I bled, as I bled
As I bled, as I bled, as I bled

[Chorus]
And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)

Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head, thoughts in my head

 [Verse 1: SNDNGCHLLZ]
Asking myself, "what's wrong with my head?"
Scary motherfucker, I'm a threat
Get yourself together, put on your favorite sweater
This is the last time you'll breathe tonight
If you have one request please don't second guess
You have little time left 'till you're gone
You've curved me enough, fell for all your bluffs
I gotta get even

[Bridge: SNDNGCHLLZ]
She thinks my charm is too much for her
Or maybe she just thinks I'm ugly
I think that she sees all my weakness
Flat-line in her heart by this weekend
She thinks my charm is too much for her
Or maybe she just thinks I'm ugly
I think that she sees all my weakness
If I can't have her, you can't either

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
In the dark, for the right price
If anyone’s among us this isn’t right
I would drink a fifth, and she would plead the 5th
Her body's not to be in sight
Blood down your legs, smile through the pain
Drugs always seem to tame me
Hold up, wait a minute
She gon' throw a fit
Tell me “go home”
But I'mma take her
Eat up on her, but her features
Honestly, the best of her is gone
I know it now but throw it to me now
Girl you showin' out
I'll give it to ya, bitch
She better throw it out
I got it goin\

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
She thinks I'm too much for her
But maybe she thinks that I'm ugly
Maybe if I take that it’s too much
Fuck her and leave her to him

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
I will have you, whether you want me or not

Now since a jit i been in love with that fuck shit

Half a fat check on my teeth like I'm Norbit
OG gas pack to contaminate lungs
Now I'm higher than orbits
Falling off like Forbes list, put the force into her core
I'm the one like I'm Obi, forcing whores to forfeit
Come within my circle, we gone clip your vocals

[Hook: XXXTENTACION]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I got black and white bitches I call it zebra
Little spots all on yo' head like a cheetah
I heard that bitch come from the jungle she a eater
You know my niggas super savage they 'gon feed her
Got clock up on my cock, like Flava Flav how you do it?

You know my niggas is shooting, no PlayStation
I know some niggas they countin' to spread hatred

Blessin' blastin', know I heard your niggas boolin'
I got some bitches, bitches they need some seducing, crucially

[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Woke up with a headache
Slapped on the rack
I’m flashin' this paper
She say she see that
She giving me dome
She said she can't breathe
She still going hard
Asthma attack
Respect my mind and respect all my thoughts
Supreme on my back, five panel hat
We playin' Chicago, so pass that shit back
Them Juicy J paper, get trippy off that
I puff and I pass, I'm bustin' right through
You catchin' a chill, ice on my neck
Gotta throw up your set, that's when them watches, the chains, the rings, be shinin' the best
So whippin' and cookin' they lookin' the best
They stain the steel from Bangladesh
She scored like a hoop, she touchin' herself
Mind on that green like I'm layin' the grass
Colored sprite it got me nice
Damn I'm lookin' swagged tonight
Where the bitch?
Teeth, pearly white she tryna fuck tonight
Rollin' up that Grandaddy, now my head feel Einstein
Sittin' back, pushing packs
Mary Jane my concubine




 [Verse]
Love is not kisses hugs
Sharing fucking drugs
Presents on your birthday
Pictures of making love
It’s dedication
Trust and patience and compromise
Now do or die
Ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between this fade
And I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly
I hate myself for creating
Pain with in your heart
And I’m thinking
To spit so tempting to scream it out
Til my demons get evil within yourself
She’s crying she needs your help
Your selfish think ‘bout yourself
All these problems created
Extended from hate with self
And I hope that you wouldn’t leave
But the patience that you would need
Is the patience of self regard
Hanging on to my selfish pleas
And I’m sorry
You deserve better
I wanted more for you
You hanging on
You being strong and I want more for you
As long as you won’t
Leave me in the end
We both can still pretend
That this life we live in is worth it I promise

 [Intro: Marilyn Manson, Bill O'Reilly]
You can take some of your lyrics as you know, you'll understand when I'm dead. I mean, these disturbed kids can take these lyrics and say, "You know when I'm dead, everybody's going to know me."
Well, I think that's a very valid point, and I think that that's a reflection of a --not necessarily this program, but of television in general.  If you die and enough people are watching, then you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well-known.  So when you have things like Columbine and you have these kids that are angry and they have something to say and no one's listening, the media sends a message that if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention, then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of Time Magazine, the media gave them exactly what they wanted

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
He don't want no one-on-one
He grab that gun
Equipped with the clip, my son
What happened to a fist fight?
Really with the shit
If a nigga pull up on me
Might shoot a nigga dick right off
And niggas often kissing coffins
Cause their brothers steady barking
At the system
Like their bitch at the apartment but
This Glock I trust, this motherfuckin' Glock I...

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
This Glock, bitch I fucking trust
This blunt, bitch I fucking trust
My bitch, I'on fucking trust
Might lose my mind for fucking trust
This Glock, bitch I fucking trust
This blunt, bitch I fucking trust
My bitch, I'on fucking trust
Might lose my mind for fucking trust

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
So why they lock my Aunty son up?
Might storm the fucking station with my motherfucking gun up
All accusations what they sum up
They locking niggas over young bitches wanting a nut bust
She popped that pussy, she was 15
If she can open up her legs, then she old enough to get dick, see
Because her parents want to flip see
They flipped the script got a nigga locked up
Some bitch shit

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
This Glock, bitch I fucking trust
My bitch, I'on fucking trust

Sing, me a sad song

You and I, it's do or die
Skies are grey, so you flew a kite
We knew

My lifetime, better days

You, I, we die

This time, I'll fly
We won't ever break
It's all I know

It's all I know
You can't ever say

Numb the pain, pain




 [Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Sever the mind
Wonder what you'll find
Within the soul's divine
Put him on ice
Watch a nigga slip think he will not suffice
Make him idol all of the infamous time
Becomes our fucking rival
Basically he battled the devil within himself
He faced a fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face
I hate this place
Goddamn disgusted by my face
I feel I wasted damn skin
'Cause the tint that's on my face

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Lemme see that

Rap rigorous
Ace the plate, killin' shit
Pace is great, villainous
Filling the plate, pissing all over your pussy pedestal
So skeptical, little edibles, spread 'em, then I'ma wet em
Forget 'em, I'll never let 'em, re-read 'em
No scope they scatter, coke flow like batter
Blood drain like batteries, all you niggas is calories
Get burned, this finger your bitch splurge
Don't forgive us just learn, you niggas should take turns
I pop that pussy like an Adderall
Niggas will act as if they powerful, but got they backs against the wall
I never give in on my niggas get bigger my nigga, and pass the stretcher
Part of the reason I fuck this all up in a second and pass the pressure
Mister Mister get your coke slang like [?]
Like Mike Vick I'm vicious and misfit
Don't fit like fitness
So fit, but, ya shit get dissed on fleek shit, my wrist on slit bitch
My dick my dick met
Shit like ass-crack
[?] quick, but slow to fight back
Niggas in Chiraq, shooting like Iraq
Death to Jah's soldiers, bust your kneecaps
I came to murder you niggas, no need to fight back
No need to fight back
No need to fight back, yeah
Turn me off, yeah




 [Verse ?]
...
Fuck your drenched, nigga get into your charm
Off of it, taking shots at your fuckin' esophagus
Save your organs, see cannibals at your knee
Better ring up off, you get caught
Or fucked inside your mind until a bitch...

 Lyrics will be available upon release!




 [Verse]
The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
I'm the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at all




 [Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Lost in regret, I
Feel so deeply, I can't seem to, find a means of ground
Lost in regret, I
Feel so deeply, I can't seem to, find a means of ground
Hear, regret
Say the words

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Don't cry, don't cry, it won't end
Pain will always be my friend
Don't cry, don't cry
Pain will always be my friend




 [Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Pick litter the middle of six niggers is bitter
As dick lickers as licking the cliques clitoris
Vigorous black bags like the vividus black Casper
Who’s backing the bash faster than Beverly
Mean cash or with Cassidy
And the passenger packin’ the shovel
Rackin’ up bodies, quicker than calories salaries
Mean spend it and vend it a pussy magnet and stagnant
And fra- fragments of faggots
Who’s clique blackin' with cactuses
And the package delivered
For fuckin' sending em cinnamon covered synonyms
Get' em got em'
Killin’ em, killable fuckin liberal kidabble
Little fucker then suck a cunt and couple of chemo therapy
Offices, officer
Of accomplishing condiments
Any converse is commonly
Incompetent prominence
Get a communist but-
They never understand
How it feels to be a man
How it feels to be a man, hmm

[Verse 2: Muddy Boots]
Rolling blunts dump the guts inside a liver pool
We gonna cop a pound of weed and a pound of shrooms
Psych-Psych- Psychedelic man now if you turn on times
I read my story line, never did indulge a crime
Never did I leave a hundred questions in my head
Shit. Nigga later, we dead
Paranormal pair of friends sayin’ fuck the World we live
Fuck, Fuck the World we live in
Fuck what I don’t represent

[Verse 3: Nyora Spouse]
Uh, slump, slump
Yeah… slump
Bitch
Same old me but a youngin got his cash up
Now I’m on the come up now these biters playing catch up-
Not talking about tomatoes
Play in my money like its Play Dough
Never with that girl you claim, my nigga is you gay though?
They say I couldn’t rap, came back like receipts
You can meet me at the Lick or you can meet me at the crib
We can fuck up in the car or we can fuck up in the sheets
Any once I am meeting you in that pussy like a meet and greet
Livin’ out my life courses
Take your bitch to eat, dining with five courses
Everything climb stars, white bitches off bars
Man some Mars, but i’m probably where I’m from




 [Intro]
Still a Very Rare young nigga
Still a Slaughterhill nigga
Still a Sunrise nigga
Still a Deepside nigga
I think it’s bout that time
'Bout that time we tell these niggas
I’ve been a nobody
I’ve been a member of the Fall
Let’s go, y’all
Aye

[Verse 1]
I am the lyrical veteran
War-struck adrenaline
Pussy boy who you is better than
Grippin that pistol grip
Yo' bitch is submissin' so I make her pistol grip
Murder and kill her jits
I strike the fucker refusin' to give a shit
Cock in her mouth to show you what I’m bout
Yes I fucked her then made that bitch shoot her kids
Three heads like cerberus, geeked off adrenaline
Feelin like Shaq, I’m a dunk on the pig
He dirty like derby, she suck me like kirby
I murder the fucker then eat on her clit
I fantisize 'bout a Japanese bitch
She fantasize about sucking my dick
She wanna be famous, for shaking her anus
I told her to Kim K and fuck on the flick

[Hook]
I got the pistol grip
I’m down to pistol whip

Nigga where the fuck is your energy, cannot mimic your enemy
Play pawn defending me, I can palm you niggas
'Cause I warned you niggas, I never swung you niggas

Harder than the Kim Possible theme song

Got a 40 Glock and that drum niggas
So when I shoot the shit they go ay
Which of you niggas is about it?

I won't harm a fly until I'm tried
Burn the fucker
Never yearned the fucker
Imma leave the body in Dubai

 [Verse]
I been in the wonder, I'm thinkin' to grab the clip
2, 3 Niggas is dead before they can dip
I'm not into blasphemous acts, but see the brothers they act
Federal tracks they splattin' at your back, hit 'em
You been waitin', watchin' with this shit
Blood up on the pussy niggas cough before we hit
Slide up on the fucker, holy water on the clip
I just hit the fucker for his loot and then I dip
Slick Scott, skinny scissorhands cut his fanny pack
Bullet proof vest upon his chest to get revenge back
Black Richie Rich gon' hold the clip until the feds pop
I karate chop the pussy 'fore they knocked his head off
Frolick pussy faggot, little maggot, I decipher this
Did the little nigga, paint his sealant like the dentist did
I'm gonna hit up dentists, fuck a sentence, let's go hit a lick
Told my mother, look at this, I'mma' fuckin' slit my wrists

[Hook]
Pussy want the argument, bullet dem cyaan test

 [Intro]
"It's crazy, Willie! You can't win. You can't beat them, never!"
Fuck yes, fuck yes

[Verse]
I flick wrist like this, like that
That brave feeling you’re standing for
Beat that bitch, disown that bitch
My dark can’t be content for long
Love her wrist, fuck a silver fist say it like Danny Glove
I ran in that bitch strapped with a Glock
Must be protecting home
Bow wow, 50 Cal ran up in her mouth
Chewy on my Louie, you a money crazed cow
I feel like “quit showing, that fanny make her blowing”
On her knees she’s begging “please” to take a pop of all her pills
Irony, irony, sad it’s all it will ever be
"Honey please, I am not a human being, I'm just a bird who heard their world was to fuck them and make them leave, who heard the world wants to fuck him and make him leave"


[Hook]
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to my jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls
Rest In Peace to her jaw
And her pussy, broke her walls

[Outro]
Fuck yes




 [Intro]
I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot

[Outro]
In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot, I'll rot
Is my pain your freedom?
Is all of my pain your freedom?
Enjoy…




 [Verse]
I'll fuck you better on everything, on everything
Your pussy was meant for me, was meant for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm havin' withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you done to me, you done to me
The pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one, your only one
I know I was wrong, wrong, wrong
Pop that pussy for X to see, for X to see
I want you right under me, te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck you with everything, everything
I want...




 [Intro]
Luke White on the beat!

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin' fuck it and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck black prejudice!"
"Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant!"
Views and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say "fuck it" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—

[Outro]
We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings

We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!

We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!

You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America, the niggers are taking it over and the Jews

Make a stand, join the klan
White power! White power! White power!

And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!
I hate them because they breathe!
I hate them because they're scum!
The goddamn niggers are the scum of the earth!
White power!

Her pussy pretty like blood rot
She gave me dome like a head-shot




 [Intro: Kanye West, Andy Kaufman & Andy Kaufman's Grandmother]
Yeah, I'm a creative genius
And there's no other way to word it
I know you're not supposed to say that about yourself
And I say things the wrong way a lot of times
But my intention is always positive
"You're... you're a genius, you really are
You're a genius"
I know

She can, she can

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Run my, run my, run my head, yeah

Run my, run my, run my head

'Til the end I'll, 'til the end I'll fight

Which nigga?
Point at any nigga from the back
Pistol on my muhfuckin' dresser
All these hoes caught me like Ketchum
Might fuck around and get sentenced
All that shit you talkin', all them pills you poppin'
All that smokin' flock, you never do it
Bitch niggas talkin', fuck you pussy boy-




 [Verse 1]
There she was, with the blade in her hand
Scars on her skin replaced kiss of the man
She's played a part for as long as she's known
Regret fills her heart as her love leaves her home
She's learned to be passive, but such is a loss
Accepting defeat without foreclosing costs
For her, this was needed to be rid of the pain
You play the victim and I'll play insane

[Hook]
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

[Verse 2]
Stomp out that fucker, his death will be slow
You made me do this, just as far as you know
If you don't exist, then my pain can be rid
So I gut the fucker then eat like a pig

[Hook]
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

[Outro]
I am the heart marksman

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Lost in the pessimistic, state of perception
It's been, hard to participate in, natural instances
And, due to my history, I, don't know what's next for me
But, keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If, dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt, I swear to God, you'll be my first
Priority before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt, I swear to God, you'll be my first
Priority before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said

Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be, dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh

[Verse 2: Kin$oul]
Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift, to a place where the devil lives
My soul rise, to a sky made of abyss
With the evidence, that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now, we tearing it down
We make these incredible sounds we cherishing now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

[Outro: Killstation]
Oh, you cannot run away
From everything you made
You try to erase
The memories will fade




 [Intro]
Got it on smash

[Pre-Chorus: XXXTENTACION]

Put her in the past, 'cause you know

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & PnB Rock]
Yeah, you know, I smashed

[Verse: PnB Rock]
She rock Carti' frames, sweet like candy canes
If I'm Superman, she my Lois Lane
Gucci everything, Louis everything
Had to cut her off, she sniff too much 'caine
Don't look so surprised, all she want to do is lie
Then she turned around and cried, demons all in her eyes
She don't feel no pain, she might be insane
Colder than some rain, pussy lemonade

 [Intro: XXXTENTACION]
You'll see
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
I see black skies, and white lies, I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me, fueling my insecurities
As the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasn't there
It's too much, my heart's crushed, I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness 'cause it's all lies
I've seen the pain, I've run away so many times
Death and I are companions, it's here at all times
I won't love, won't trust, I won't die
I can’t feel, but managed to steal your heart, love
Was dirt poor, now fuck whores and want love
It seems that anything offered could be enough but
It's time
Body falls so I don't know, who to call at all
Alone, and my heart, got tat
Of it broke
I'm so fucking numb, my life has succumb
To hatred and death, alone
In the snow

[Outro: Killstation]
Mmmmmm, mmmmmm
Mmmmmm, mmmmmm
Mmmmmm, mmmmmm
Mmmmmm, mmmmmm




 [Intro: Elliot Gould, Edward Norton & Beverly D'Angelo]
*Scene from American History X*

[Elliott Gould]
That's my point it's an irrational act, it's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.

[Beverly D'Angelo]
Exactly, I mean it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68.

[Edward Norton]
It's crap, I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a cop-out, it's Opportunism at it's worst, it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more.

[Hook]
Aye, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke

And if the world ever has an apocalypse
I will kill all of you fuckers
Fear will be plentiful, death will be bountiful
I will spare none of you peasants
Fuck your religion, your pastor fucked kids
And got sent to a prison in PC
I seen the devil, he's in you and me
You need saving to listen to this, see
Follow 'em home, cut the right corner so nobody sees you
Turn off your phone
Leave it at home so nobody can trace you
Mask your expressions
Appear to be calm, they won't read your intentions
As soon as you’re in
Let them all know who they’re all in the presence of

[Instrumental]

[Monologue]
I, I don't remember much
I just seen her dead in there
It definitely stood out
I remember your smell when I touched you
How she used to talk to me
It all hurts so much now
How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even love me
Even though all the time I spent, its just worthless
Now I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore
Save me

[Intro]
Yeah
Prxz
The evolution is near
The brains will start to abandon their religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Yeah

[Verse]
I behead a motherfucker for his contacts
Take the body where the others can't see
Seen the devil in my eyes without them contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea
Yuh, narcissistic crucifixion
Dead weight, I been searching
Niggas coexist, you just don't see 'em work with other bitches
It's me, black and white, the dark of night
That's when I do my searching
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind
The evolutions lurking

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my-

 [Verse]
17
My collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real life situations I've lived
17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
My own personal number
Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
By listening to this album, you are literally, and I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind
And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen
I do not value your money
I value your acceptance and loyalty
Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
I put my all into this, in the hopes that it will help cure or at least numb your depression
I love you
Thank you for listening
Enjoy




 [Intro]
Fool's gold is a common man's trash
I've seen God, I've seen devils, I've seen many men...
Mothers, children, fathers...
I've seen The Fall
Fuck the naysayers, the conformants

[Verse]
Black Benz, and the
Black friends, when the
Nigga feelin' so killer could put a kids in a
Chokehold, them living with no soul
A pity, how niggas pity me, kitty with no goals
I jump, fall, neck snaps, I slip not
I told 'em cold in the weather so we can get-got
M5, two of them, we fucked in
And I remember December when you was tucked in place
Is the place, man it's cold
And they chose this place so you could never fall
So beware because the fall is all we know
An empty corpse around parading in the snow
Fuck

[Bridge]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Yea, yeah
Aye, yea

[Outro]
THIS IS IT
Yea, this is all we know, this is all we know

 [Refrain]
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

[Verse]
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

[Chorus]
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al- (right)
We gon' be al- (right) we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be alright
We gon' be al- (right) we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be al (right)
We gon' be alright, we gon' be al-

 [Possible Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Sever the mind, wonder what you'll find within the soul's divine
Put 'em on ice, watch the nigga slip, think he will not suffice
Make 'em idle, all to be infamous, time becomes a fucking rival
Basically battled the devil within himself, he faced the fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face, I hate this place
Goddamn, disgusted by my face
I feel like a waste of damn skin because the tint that’s on my face




 [Verse 1: Scott James]
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Forgive what's said in fear
And all I ask of you is hear
The girl with the golden heart
I killed from the inside out at dawn
The sun's only just arose
Can't amount to all the hearts I've broke
The boy with the broken heart
His goal is to rip everything apart

[Hook: Scott James]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

[Bridge: Scott James]
The oars start sinking
When you let go
To use your hands while speaking
Saying, don't never let us float

[Hook]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave even for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

I must have caught your cold
I could not sleep at all
I'm clinging on for hope
I need you as I'm close

 [Intro: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you, looking for a brighter season (yeah)
Need to lay your burden down (haha)
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling (young blood sucka')
Buried under deeper ground (uh)
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

[Chorus: Laura Mvula (Reversed)]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everybody is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts

[Chorus: Laura Mvula (reversed) & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
My hypothesis is, death ain't shit
Hey there you
I'd rather die than be alive in this life
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Honestly full of trife and strife
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Jah

[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Through the sky
Through-through the sky

[Hook: Laura Mvula (reversed)]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—
Through the sky
Through-through the sky

You take Xans that's pressed

Pull up on your momma I say "A Bay Bay"

Bitch off the rip
Just like a baby she just gon' take it from the tip
I just "Swiper, no swiping" that pussy 'cause I dip
Walked up in the division like "are you tryna pull?"
And there's no nigga that I fear
Got the horror of a spear
Got to be kidding me, made me giggle like tickle me
You said this nigga envy me
Bitch you shaped like a centipede
And my songs long as centuries
Bitch I must have to pull the .45 on my hip
I just got her cum on my dick
Arthritis wrist on sick
Cut my diamonds then get blisters
Blood diamond, ratchet ass bitch
She done sucked my dick and then you kissed her
You just might just throw a bitch fit
Bender with me cause the metal on my hip
Four-five bust like zit

 [Intro]
God...
Who the fuck is...
Who the fuck is...
Ayy...
Cocaine...
Ayy...

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I’m fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it’s written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn’t see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull
And so...
If there's a fucking god, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men
Innocent
See, living for a reason I don't know
Fuck shit hoe

[Verse 2: Sully the Chief God]
It's Sully the Chief God
Hold up
Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as the eagle takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down on my knees
Bow down on my knees
Fuck that
Smoke that DMT

[Verse 3: Nyora Spouse]
You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends
Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it
Now let me take you back to the story, that I once told
Ayy, ayy, that I once told...




 [Hook]
YEAH!
It's all in my, it's all in my head
It's all in my, it's all in my head
NO!
NO!
NO!
It's all in my head
It's all in my, it's all in my head
YEAH, YEAH!

[Outro]
It's all in my head...
