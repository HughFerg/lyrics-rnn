Brick and balony in my pocket, Milonakis stew!

[Chorus]




 [Hook: Tadoe]
Remember runnin' in the house just ridin' steamers
Now I pull up mansion, foreign beamers
That bitch she all on me, take a breather
A nigga try to rob me, I won't leave him
Caught tha nigga lackin', let him have it
I'ma buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
He don't want no smoke, he scared of that gas
Nigga don't want no money I think he scared of that cabbage

[Verse: Chief Keef]
You say you gon' buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
Well I'm gon' buy a mansion instead of 10 traps
Cuz I got indicted doin' that shit already
And judge [?] trynna send my black ass back
Pussy you better watch that back
That bitch gave me top and it's not that bad
Cuz you know I got that bag
Took that bitch to my house and she seen that maid, checkin out that trap//trash (?)
Bitch these Balenciagas on my feet
[These ain't no damn] 11s or no 5s
Nigga totin' revolvers for they heat
Niggas ain't shootin' no 40s or 45s
Give Tadoe the 30, my 40 tote 45
Blood money got the mac and he gon' pimp your ride
Niggas ain't gettin' no cabbage
Took 20Gs motherfucker, and I done count it back
Say you gon squeeze motherfucker but i doubt it, that shit happened
Tryna kill me muthafucka like tryna kill Captain America
"What's your chain Chief Sosa?", about 84 karats
And I'm only 18, muthafucka but y'all just live with your parents
Got niggas with heaters, need feature, [?]
Bad bitch say she seen us, but hood friends ain't believers
She'll eat us like a pizza, cuz i'm cool like a freezer
Remember ridin' steamers, but now I can have 10 beamers

[Hook: Tadoe]




 [Verse 1]
Got his bitch tripping 'cause she seeing me, thought she was off a trippy stick
Don't know why she sneak dissing me, say he got a shrimpy dick
Pull off in that Rarri, now they think I'm on some fishy shit
Two year ago I didn't have no car, I was on that come get me shit
Two years ago I didn't have no job, I was on that young drilla shit
Posted on the block with the Glock, tryna drill some shit
Don't give no fuck, that thot with the opps, I'ma drill a bitch
And I swear these opps know how I rock, Glo until I be killed
I dont want your bitch, boy, trying to see if i can fit my schedule with her
I won't wife a bitch, boy, these bitches be going everywhere
I don't care about going to jail, they treat me like heaven there
Before I let a nigga try and kill me, I'ma send his ass 11 shells




 [Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Goddamn my swag O.D
No seeds in my weed
30 clip in my waist
Bullets spraying like sheen
I'm hitting shit low-key
Like my nigga Odee
RIP Odee, that was the bro-skey
I'm living life fast
Can't give a nigga no pass
And bitch trained to go, so on sight I'm gon' blast
Kush got me chokin'
Let's toast if you blowin'
Let's smoke if you hittin'
Let's roll if you rollin'
Sosa blowing, he ain't goin'
It's killing season for these fuck niggas when I get to blowin'
Smoke on the low end
And I ain't with the romance
You gotta do the team, for 300 she go in

My lawyer beat the case, it cost 'bout 24
Gotta take down my connect 'cause he want 24
He payed one for 16 but he want 24
Can't show you no 16 if you ain't 24
And when I was 16, my hoes was 24
My wrist cost 33, but I spent 24
My clip holds 33, but I shot 24

Let me catch an opp, he gon' catch 24
Let me see an opp, I'm gon' stomp
I'ma take his life with this Glock 24
Pour a 4 in 20 ounce, call it 24
Doing shows, ain't no security at the show
But the Glo and these Glock 24's
Posted on the block, pulling 24's
Half a book of D, we get it for the 24
Only gun I'm carring is this Glock 24
Shoot him in his head with this Glock 24
It ain't no game, it leave big holes
RIP Zay, RIP Snupe

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
They like all hail Almighty So

 [Verse 1: Ballout]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
I'm in a truck called SRT or somethin'
Doin' Need for Speed or somethin'
Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like "Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?"
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin'

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a half P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg "What's the wiz-zard?"
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 3: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man
Ball Gucci, he rock Gucci, he don't like Ray-Bans
Spikes so big I feel like a fuckin' caveman
Slick listenin' to this shit on his J-pad
No, I ain't Kanye, but I'm playin' cray-cray
Slick say fuck three-way, foe nem doin' eight ways
Sosa, you trust me? That's like askin' can a day wait
Told her don't play dum-dum, chew me like yum-yum
Girl I got a hundun, you ain't got a bum-bum
Tell me do you want one? I won't tell no one, do it when the folks come
You in the whip with me nigga, go ahead and blow some
Boy, you could be 250, don't hit no one
I got 100K, nigga come be my doorman
Thought you couldn't swim 'til you ended up floatin'
Had to close my heart when it ended up open
Ridin' down Washington, headin' up ocean
When it come to bread, I'm toastin'
Inside peanut butter, call that [?]
How I'm pushin' this bitch, nigga call that stroller
Bitch so bad, had to call that over
I'm goin' so fast, they gon' want this slower
[?] low, but I want it lower
Gave me more, but I want it more
Hear the buzzer beater, what's the score?
Said she love coke like what's the snort?
[?] just said that what's the Porsche?

[Verse]
Niggas be like when I see Sosa, I'ma treat that nigga on everythang
But niggas don't be on a damn thang
Niggas ain't even snatch my damn chain
Smoke so many trees, wonder what my breath like
But I be shinin' bright like a damn light
You should be like Asian girls, baby girl you damn right
Cause these thotties going any damn way
Unlike me, who can do it any better
I'ma do this shit in any weather
And I bet I'll have your bitch follow my campaign
Try me, guns be like I am bang
Cause we got two twelves, when them guns blow and bang
Let me catch a nigga from the low and bang
Let me catch a nigga from Insane
He gone be on the first song right along with Ben Franklin

[Hook]

Bang bang

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I was sittin' at home, I was rollin' a blunt
I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone
Got a call from my boys like, "Your cousin is dead"
I was like, "He couldn't had his head on"
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
Give me the chance then I'll head home
I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe
On the freeway I'm headin' home
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
Why I go hard, Blood be the reason
Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin'
Gotta take charge, every four seasons
Every month, every day and every weekend

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I bet you remember posted on the block
All we knew was shots
We ain't really know about the guap
All we knew was Glocks
I remember when you called my phone tweakin'
You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, "Nah you're Almighty"
Almighty don't like nobody
Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning
God chose us, and gave it up
Dead or alive, niggas still hatin' us
It's the end of the quarter, I'm a rock with sticky D
I'ma pass the pall to you and you can hang it up

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Outro: Chief Keef]
No matter what I might say
No matter what you might say
No matter what I say
No matter what your friends say
No matter what our friends say
No matter what, what I say
No matter what, what I say
Just know this, I miss you Big Glo

How many times you said you're down with me?
All of these times you thought you were on to me
I don't love you, I know baby, I'm so wrong
You called me, like Monica, I'm so gone
You leavin' voicemails like, "Nigga please, answer your phone"
Slammin' my doors sayin' I ain't goin' home
Scratchin' my cars with keys
Hitting my Balmain's with bleach
Broke the glass all in my seat

Don't want me to see my shawty
That's that shit my mama taught me
For all the shit my mama bought me

Been smoking on dope in the fastest car
Bought three chains from Johnny Dang
And coulda bought an Aston Martin

[Verse 1:]
I got weed I don't need bitches

Got my Glock on me case a nigga think it's macaroni
Smoking on a big blunt of tooka
She ain't want me when I was in the hood hood
Now I'm rich she say she got that good good
Pistols beat like KRK, we coming through day by day
We don't want no peace treaties, we don't want no dang all day
Wop made me up a peace treaty and we pulling off having a race
Walked in the bank with a smirk, walked out laughing away
I'm rich now
I can buy a school or a club or a business now
My niggas in the field still layin' fuck niggas down
These fuck niggas don't like how I'm living now

Can't wear these trues no more, bitch I got food stains on 'em
This nigga say he don't like me, this bitch got who ringtone
I got play-do, I don't play though
And I just smoked earth boy, not no mango
And right now, I like Beamer trucks not no Range Rovers
On my way to pick up 50 thousand but the bank closed

[Verse 1]

Shoot a nigga dead then go smoke my brains out

And I know I'm a rapper, I still got them thangs though
Spilled a drink on me, I slapped her cause I had to change clothes

Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad

Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

[Verse 1]
I got big knots, in my Balmains

Get to sparkin', no talkin'
Chopper in the bag, make the mall rain

I got the heat though, for niggas trickos
Stack blue cheese up, like they Pringles

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad

Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

[Verse 2]
Hop in a switch up, commit a pick up

New Louies, come take a picture
Commit a touchdown, from a kick-up
2 3 finna stick up, how your stick-up?
How your funds up? How your quick-up?
When it's time for the hit, uh, don't catch the hiccups
You ain't really 'bout it, give that stick up

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad

Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

K.E. on the Track

[Verse]
Shawty said she was a dreamer
I turned they asses to a believer
My other bitch like Justin Bieber
I guess that bitch a belieb
I still remember my hoes
I bet they still remember micro
Wavy bitch off my grow
You only want me 'cause my life glows
All these bitches chasing after D
Tell these bitches, “Chase after cheese”
I forgot I'm the fucking G
I ride alot around, spending Gs
Who raised me, my momma granny
No actor, but I need a grammy
Taxing niggas Uncle Sammy
Girl you know I'm Sosa Sammy
I don't be off the molly
I just be off a lot of weed
Pull up, crash the party
Shots at everybody
Can't be chasing these hoes
Gotta be chasing these rolls
I was dreaming until I woke
I ain't a dreamchaser, bitch, I just glo
Sosa, you be flexing, I know
Sosa, you keep weapons, I know
I ain't got a yacht, I got a boat
And that bitch is big as my home
I was locked up, Divison 4
Repping my set 'cause niggas hoes
I remember back in '94
Wait, I was born in '95 tho
Remember trapping just to get a coat
'Member trapping just to get some clothes
Now I buy anything I want
Anything I want in any mall
I ain't never been to Mexico
But I'm smoking on Texaco
Remember pilling out in 4 4s
Now I get 90 for four show
Jewelry and commas for a show
I threw it in the water and let it float
It's icy, like the fucking North Pole
I don't need no stylist for my wardrobe
Look, lady, I got the fucking pack
And I got the motherfucking sack
It's a lot of snakes in the grass
Watch out, they'll bite you in yo back

Just in case the police stop us

Don't be up in the lane when I'm bowling guns
Fuck nigga better not blow ya nose or nun

[Hook :]
I keep that hot shit like a Tea pot
OG stuffed in a cookie jar
Pull up, boy you better have the guap
I'm a doctor, give ya pussy ass a shot
While you was on a hill, I was somewhere in the field
Now I'm working towards a billon, and I'm living in the hills
Tucked in my drawls, bitch I got the Tommy Hil-
-figer if it sizzle's, its a scary site, ew
Pussy you be talking bout a bunch of nonsense
Money all up on my conscience
Latex, we can get it poppin'
Led Zeppelin, and you know how I'm rocking'
Ridin with the mop, going up like a stock
Whats up in my pocket? its a muthafucking knot
Pull that bitch out make it rain on a thot
My pistol got a dick, make it piss on a opp




 [Hook]
I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired

Them pistols get to bussing, Boo-ya-ya
You ain't with the Glo Gang nigga, who are ya?
Steady texting my phone, this just bitch just blew my high

[Verse]
This bitch just blew my high
And I was high off all of these drugs
I walk in the mall and buy out all of these stores
Nigga came out with two bags he thought he was
I was off that dope and I was high of all this lean
Let a nigga try me, I got my Glock forty
It got thirty shots in it, it gon' make em scream
(SCREAM!)
Hey Sosa, why you so high?
I gotta get high, to balance my low
I'm moving too fast, I gotta pour a four
Spend lots of cash, 'member used to be broke
Sosa, what you got a gun for?
Cause I'ma shoot when I see my opponent
Shoot late ass nights and early ass mornings
But hold up I gotta roll me a Dutch

[Hook]
I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired

You ain't with the Glo Gang nigga, who are ya?
Steady texting my phone, this just bitch just blew my high

Popping shit like vegetable oil

Nigga don't want no money, I think he scared of that cabbage

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Tadoe say he gon' buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
Well I'm gon' buy a mansion instead of 10 traps

Pussy you better watch that back
That bitch gave me top but it's not that bad
Cause you know I got that bag
Took the bitch to my house and she seen that maid taking out that thrash
Bitch these Balenciagas on my feet

Niggas tote revolvers for the heat
Niggas ain't shooting no 4-O's or 4-5's
Give Tadoe the 30, my 4-O toting 4-5
Blood Money got the Mac and he gon' pimp your ride
Niggas ain't getting no cabbage
Took 20 G's mothafucka, and I counted that shit backwards
Say he gon' squeeze, he gon' fuck it, but I doubt if that shit happen
Tryna kill me mothafucka, like tryna kill Captain America
Wanna see a chain, Chief Sosa bought 84 carats
And I'm only 18 mothafucka, but you still live with your parents
Niggas with heaters be feature

Come and get this work cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it

[Verse 1]
In the strip club, throwing money like it's nothing
Smoke that bitch out, now the police fussing
Make the po' man nigga know that we coming
Shorty on X, don't tell me if you see something

Remember growing up like I gotta be something
All this fucking cake like I gotta eat something
And I'm tryna quit but the drank keep callin'

[Chorus]
Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless

Catch 'em, can't catch 'em

Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protection

[Verse 1]
Nigga say he want it beef, then slide then
I'm in a car driving fast, no license with the pipe and
'Member I used to fuck around, had a white hand
I got my money in this Louie Suitcase but its trifling
Cause I done spilled codeine all over it
And I was rolling weed all over it
2004, LV's all over it
I really don't fuck with G's if y'all ain't notice it

[Hook]
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
If I stretched her, she ain't special
It's endings to this shit with this .50, it ain't levels
For the runners, and their medals
Gold diggers, and their jewels
I ain't ever going broke, bitch never, say never
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
My car's too special
My house too big
So thots keep stretchin
And I live there by myself
Me and a lot of weapons
Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protection

Got some bitches on my block, thats gon' set your ass up
Got some shooters on my roster, bet they'll wet your ass up
These bitches call me thirsty, I got liquor in my cup

I'm with lightshow, Wild, and Chief Keef. GBE, and SB
My real live niggas from the South Side, back to North East

[Hook: Lightshow]
I like my bitches with an ass on them
She want a nigga with some cash on him

Unless I'm in the strip club throwing cash on her

Keep your box, get that top up
I'm a flex till I’m dead, I ain’t locked up

[Verse 2: Dew baby]
Adidas in Atlanta I'm in L.A. kissin' Ella
Diamonds in my pinky and my chain sit on my belly
The shit my shooters shootin' leave you shakin' like a dancer
And if you niggas want some smoke, you're not gon' get the cancer
Run em down, gun sound, yellow tape, no escape
I break the whole thing down and bag the shit that’s on the plate
Money chase the bitches, bitches got to chase the money
I pulled up in the Chrysler just to keep that shit 3 hunna (BEEP)
Icy like the winter but I'm shinning like the summer
And we don’t go nowhere without the sticks we like some drummers
Crack just like a plumber, shootin' pistols like they're jumpers
I don’t know what niggas doing, but I know we doing numbers

[Verse 3: Meatchi]
All right, I like my bitches with an ass on em
Who like your bitches to fuck and you spend them bands on her
This niggas tripping and flipping  like they some damn quarters
Fifty ass niggas drown, they can hold they water
Go get that top pried, 30 make their heart stop
With no love, lost my heart, cold like my damn watch
These niggas faggies I hate em, get out my damn car
I got a bitch who suck my dick and then she want to rock
These bitches love me and love me, I see why niggas haten'
And Toby told me kill it, keep them patiently waiting
Cause he'll be home soon, bitch its coming real soon
And everybody screaming “BEEF,” wondering what we doin' to him

[Hook]

They say I came up, they say my name poppin'
Now niggas sneak dissin', but they name droppin'
They say that Sluttyboyz game poppin'
And GBE real life, losing ain’t an option

[Verse 5: Chief Keef]

Sucka' niggas can't eat, we gon' smash on him
Bitch I only like the ass on ya

While I'm smoking on this dope this bitch keep calling my phone
Don't you see I'm getting high, bitch just leave me alone

Busting like I'm Dillinger, got my dumb ass pulled over

[Hook]

And it's all because I'm getting money




 [Hook]

[Verse 1]

Don't worry bout me, I'm getting money I'm good

The police can run in here, I don't give no fucks

[Hook]
My glove department filled with residue

I'm in your city for a day, bitch, check it out
Too late, bitch, I'm already checking out
The cops pull up on me, they like check it out
Glad my shit was tucked and I ain't have the weapon out

[Verse 1]
Hit the dealership like check it out, my doors creep me out

Wanna smoke, check it out

Check in at the doctor, get prescripted then I'm checking out

She step outside the box then I check her out
Like a half way house, I'm checking in, checking out
I'm checking my car for bugs, checking my car for dubs
I'm checking my car for change, just to give to the club
Folk nem check the spot now we gone come through, line 'em up
Check 'em in the torture house, drown his ass, tie him up
I check my money, better be right when I count it up
I go to sleep, what the fuck I see, Cap and Blood
Folk nem said they had to check and make sure that I'm acting up
Feet hit the concrete, hopping out the swan doors
I got a package coming in and I was checking the time for it
These Louie shades, lil mama, these ain't no Tom Ford's
The bitch was checking me out, soon as I walked in the door
I was checking for racks, for cheese, for green, for lawn mowers
Go and get some Maison Margiela, no need to see the concords
I'm checking for cappers, for boolers, the shooters, the 9 blowers
I'm checking on folks, they cooling, they booling with 9 whores
I'm smoking on dope, I'm cooling, I be smoking that mind blower
Come through, I'm checking, I'm chasing, yeah I'm checking for my boys
I ain't checking for hoes, I get my box and check up boy
I ain't checking for you, you sitting on yo ass, get up boy
Sacks and build direct, Margelias and marble floors

 [Intro]
Bang!

[Verse]
I got apes in my crib like the Chicago Zoo
Ya'll sneak a shot in, do what ya'll gone do
Cause once we hear some shots we blow an Uzi with the 2's
Fat ass .223 chopper, his kufi was shooting
Was in my backyard, a long beach just like Snoop
I can't count all this money, 3-2-3, 2-3-2
I was selling snails while you niggas was in school
Say hello to my little friend, he gone reply what it do
I got lions, tigers, bears, jaguars, panthers, sheeps, and goose
Hyenas and monkeys, monkey nuts up on my tool
I got giraffes and elephants, you know what's in my room
I got camels and baboons, they gone get the tool
I got 30 shots in my trap like I'm on the block
My trap on their heels, Jack and Jill get knocked
Down to the ground, niggas stumblin' a lot
Got my chopper in the jungle, they be rumblin' a lot
When you play my shit they start a riot
Start a fight, we start a fire
Nina don't remember clownin, hop in my Audi, I'm outie
Spendin' money like a Saudi
In the Valley out in Cali
No LA fitness, make you lose weight, bitch Bali
On my dick, she lick it, she remind me of a mistress
On my dick stay gettin' it, you will think I killed it
Call me Weezy baby, car ain't got no ceilings
The AR-15 start dancin' cause ya'll got no bang
I'm coolin' in the water with the stingrays and sharks
You think you are tequila these the shots on the rocks
Rollin in that Nascar, pull up, hit the pitstop
Bad bitch head high, now I'm gettin' neck top
Run up in your party bitch, we rockin' it
Police can't come through the door, cause I'm lockin' it
Unless they got a warrant, they just talkin' shit
Fed house still doors why ya'll talk this shit?
You tryna catch a nigga slippin'
Crusin' in a rental
Make your bitch forget her business
Like amnesia was the issue
Bitch don't look at me when you sneeze
Cause I probably ain't got the tissue
Nigga lookin' at me like it's sweet
Like I ain't got the pistol
I do this bitch like the swat, nigga clear the spot
You don't hear the shots, you need a cotton swab
When the doctor bring your bitchass back
We come through pop his ass
Start runnin' from the cops
Crossover, rocked his ass
I'm coolin' in the 60's up in Slauson
And a broker in New York cause I'm a baller
This ho gave me her number like I'm gone call her
She was standin' up high but now she's fallin'
I see you lookin' with your lookin' ass nigga
You can't act like you ain't hate, you mad nigga
You'se a Ratatouille, you'se a rat nigga
I get blue cheese, I'm a black nigga
I hit Saks and fucked up a sack
Came out lookin' cool
When I say okay Kool-Aid it really mean okay cool
I know you smell me
I'm bringing like, I'm ridin' round with food
It's that loud pack, where the dog at? I got Snoop
You can see the aftermath man, not done bustin' tools
Nigga, you'se a bunny rabbit, Slim Shady, what it do?
My money superstitious see it comin' out the room
While they hate justify belief in supernatural coupes

Choppas chop your block down

[Chorus]
All these bitches, know I get dough
Pop a nigga soul like crisco

Fat ass on my bitch though
Big rims, on my whips though

You talk a lot but you ain’t on shit though
We let off shots, you ‘bout to get hit though

[Verse 1]
In the AMG, lookin' like I cook dope
Since I'm a fucking pimp, I'ma need a good hoe
Catch your ass lackin', give your ass some good smoke
The bitch up in this foreign will give your ass some good throat
The bitch up in the trap will give your ass a good pack
The shooter ridin' with me get your ass in a bag
Beef ain't really nothin', nah, really it's a snack
Before I made it here, I was runnin' through the packs
Runnin' thru the racks up in Saks, it's a fact
To ride presidential, I done blacked out the 'lac
Put the rover up and I done backed out the back
Told 'em send the fiends to the back house for crack
I hop up out the whip, look like I sell controlled substances
When she see the ice, I bet I leave the bitch like, ''Oh, shit!''
Lookin' like the plug, 'cause I'm really on my boss shit
Trapper on my lap, just in case I have to bust shit

[Chorus]
Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope

Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope

[Verse 2]
Got a hundred bags, served all dimes
Got a thousand more of those, call the line
Snowman, I want seventeen fives
Why a dealership tellin' me lies?
Told me that my trunk was up in the front
But it's in the back, bitches think it's summer
Slide the van doors, beat a nigga drum
I promise you won't even see a nigga comin'
'Cause I move like Obama, probably fucked your mama
Saw a bad bitch walkin', she want me to run up
She saw the falcon stripes down the middle of the foreign
Saw the fire out the pipes then Ii knew that bitch was goin'
Don't make me hit your college, fuck your bitch up in your dorm
I don't even know her, too many bitches in my phone
Let me cut this Marvin on, that mean we can get it on
You know bitches love dope, that's why they can't leave me 'lone

[Chorus]
Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope

And who else could do it better?

[Chorus, Chief Keef]
I live my life normal but my shit ain't regular

[Verse 1, GC]

I do it for the hood, yeah them niggas out there stupid
Gettin all that money all my niggas out there movin'
Trappin' or ballin' whatever you should call it
Them niggas who have my back whenever I should call em'
I see 'em in a daze, me and Keef we gettin' paid
Smokin' on that loud, you can smell it a block away
Hit the strip all day, all strapped all day
And you know I gotta get it with the guys so I admit it
To tell you what it is, but this is what it isn't
I do it for the hood and the guys up in the system
Some real niggas gone, but you know I really miss em'
So stayin on my feet, for these niggas I ain't slippin
They trippin'

[Chorus, Chief Keef]


[Verse 2, GC]
Let's kick it, but I ain't talkin' parties
I'm in the air right now and I ain't talkin' where them stars be
I'm talkin' bout that good shit, that loud shit, no mouth shit
Ballin' like the Mavericks, want cash to come and see me
These haters, I can't see 'em, I can't see 'em like they Stevie
Standin' on my shit, in the hole like Michael Beasley
Trappin' in the hood with them guys what I'm good at
Never sweat with racks, so I never even look back
When the hood is up, the police they tear it down
But I freeze and tell them hoes that they be thirsty when I post up
Bands is gettin' off and these bitches gettin' lost
Cuz bands is gettin' off and these bitches gettin' lost, Ah!

[Chorus, Chief Keef]

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Ganja Ganja, I be smoking Ganja

Ay Trel over here, he pull up in the whip
Gotta lot of banana clips, fruity nigga don't get mixed
I say bitch I'm from Chiraq, we got more killers than Afghanistan

Taking pictures in the hood, some of these niggas be snitches
Pillow talking with hoes, while I'm counting my riches
Bad bitches we call it, I'm on the block with my niggas
Louie V on the pillows smoking weed with them killas
I'm a ride for my niggas now the world gone feel us
Underrated by some, disputed by many

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 3: Fat Trel]
This shit don't make no sense
All the money all the bitches I get

It's on my lap I don't tote it in the air
I can't forget to flip and whip and make a pot
Molly high you can see it in my eyes
Give her dick cause I know she likes to ride
And she fuck me anywhere at any time
I make a hit she take a brick and break it down
Stuff the brick and make my bitches wait in line
It's nothing new cause boy I do this all the time
And since I shoot she better knew to have mine

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Chorus]
I'm a real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Remember when Tech used to come in a coffin
Remember Actavis came with a double seal
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself
Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head
You ain't sipping drank, that shit head
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis
I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit

[Verse 1]
It's payday every day
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch, skate
Can't come through, ball and no chain
Adios, knock 'em back to 5th grade
And what I'm sippin' on a milkshake
I'm sharper than a switchblade
All hundreds on me, but I'm on a rampage
My ice kicking ass, no MMA
Yeah, I'm sippin' Hardt
I just poured a 12, you be pouring 4's
You be sipping yellow, you be sipping green
That shit deadly, you need to stick to weed
I got 20 pints up in my closet
They gon' be down for the week up
This bitch got up in my car
Told the bitch put on a seatbelt
She steady asking how to lift the seat up
Had the nerve to ask me for a lean cup
Where your ass was at for the re-up?
The drank just hit with me a prenup
Bang, bang

[Chorus]
I'm a real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Remember when Tech used to come in a car

You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself

You ain't sipping drank, that shit head
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis
I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit

[Verse 2]
I'm up in Houston where this shit came from
Didn't know about bank accounts, I went and made one
You got red in here, get away from my dope
This bitch too damn playful, spilled drank on my clothes
Love no thotties, I don't
Hopped out of a Rhino
Your life fugazi, you need to undo
Backspace, typeover
Drank made me go, "I need you" (need you)
If it ain't purple then I can't see you (see you)
Bitch just text me saying "I'm gon' free you when I see you"
I'm a well known nigga, you a Dr. Doolittle
I'm sipping on beetlejuice
Call a camera man, it's a photoshoot
Me and 20 pints, I pour 'em by the 2
Bang, bang

[Chorus]
I'm a real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Remember when Tech used to come in a car
Remember Actavis came with a double seal
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself
Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head
You ain't sipping drank, that shit head
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch

I started in the basement, now I'm in a mansion
I took Ben Franklin, and held him for ransom
I lived with my granny, now I got 10 bedrooms
I rolled in a putt putt, now my car got so much leg room
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver

[Verse 1]
You try shit, I buy shit
Get the blicky, It's lightning
No 30, It's Mike Vic
Thats 52 shots in this hundred
Cause if you fill it up it cannot breath
This cash in my pocket cannot leave
Get seasoned and fall just like leaves
Girl your nigga wanna ball just like me!

My whole fucking body numb, larocaine
I'm a motherfucking boss, you're a lame
How I bowl through these niggas, you're a lane
Knock your neck down your chest, now you're a chain

She eat me in my Louie shorts, she bite shorts
The weed make me project, there's science in the weed
Let a nigga try me, he be dying with them trees
You think I'm flying on this [?]
Treat my life like Orlando, Its magic
Play this shit up in the club, Its tragic
You ain't getting money, I can see it, no statics

Up to the top, I climb and climb
No cash for me to see, then I'm going blind
I'm gliding like a GLOverboard, I don't need no wheels
I don't think its purple rain if I don't see the seal

And this money comin' either way
And I'm money hungry either way
Dreads low, you can't see my face
Eyes low, I can't see the place
I'm smokin' dope, I can't feel my face
That was gone happen either way
I'm gon' let that semi spray
A fuck nigga in my way and that's either way
I'm ridin' Bentley's MIA
My chopper Kimmy K, I nicknamed her Kimmy Karday
Just bought some semis today
My ning ding went MIA

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I remember sellin' coke girl I get booked for shows
‘Member some lil thots but my phone full of those
And a lot of guns bitch my home full of those
Either way, you get 8 shots out this Ruger nose
She wanna come to my house, I'm like girl no clothes
She wanna smell my gwoyop, I'm like girl yo' nose
Bitch what you talkin' bout, I'm into it with O-we
You don't give me top I'm into it with you

You ain't smokin' loud, that's filthy
Told my lean-man "double seal me"

And these hoes on my back like my Fendi
You niggas need to E.N.D. the envy
And the troopers stop my car just to frisk me
Big stash in it, they think that it's empty

[Verse 1]

Jump in front of this metro train, and get ran over

 [Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I'm startin' off my day with a blunt of herb
Lookin' myself up see how much I'm worth
I'm ridin' down the block in this silver Porsche
That bitch already know that I'mma flirt
I'm back off in the stu working on some new
You get 8 bars for 10, 12 for that times 2
50 for a show, 20 for a verse
As soon as I'm done I'm countin' like a nerd
My baby need some new and she get it first
I'mma be sober real soon so I need some herb
I hopped out of that Rari with that Louis bag
And if a nigga try me for it I'mma do his ass
I count a million dollars in my mansion
Hoes everywhere I got bitches dancin
Choppas in the closet pounds in the den
We got the 30's on us meet that many men
Couple M16's this ain't no force

Every druggie, even police
Niggas know not to run up on Chief Sosa
Cause he got that heat and he gon' let it breathe
I know he talkin' but I'm gon' let you see
When the pistol come up what the uppercuts mean
Baby I don't listen to nothin' but me

She see my neck and freezes

[Hook]




 [Hook: Chief Keef]

Grab a big mac, break your Kit Kat
All these tools on me, and I can fix that

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
When I was up in rehab, I was smokin' tooka dope
Aye boy what you smokin' on? It's probably some fookah dope
Buy a Gucci throw it on, 5000 for it, how you ain't know?

I am sippin' purple drank, no girl, this is not yellow
No I do not know that hoe, she in Miami, I know
Now I'm somewhere in west coast, smokin' on the best dope
Fat ass clipper in my chop, if you want a trim, let's go
Ooh, I'm acting a fool, hoes say I'm rude
And some say I'm cute, and make me food
I'm up at Barney's, don't want no Louis
I want Balmain's, I don't want no shoes

Ooh, my watch a fool

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
Y'all know how we bummin' man

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Put a nigga on a stretcher
Who is that though? Youngest flexer
Y'all got questions, I can't answer
I'm a rich nigga, no time for dandruff
Dodgin' Aiki, smokin' dopey

Nigga, I'm 2-4, you do not know me
You are a peon, that's what she told me




 [Intro: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Twenty thousand, all hunnits, thumbin through a check
Twenty thousand, all hunnits, thumbin through a check
Twenty thousand, all hunnits, thumbin through a check
Got a hunnit in the auto, leave them ponies wet
Got on shit that ain't out yet
I'm too cool, airy jet
Use your brain it could eject
Bendin up, I gets erect
Throwin' bands on my set
I'm fly as fuck like a jet
Got a bitch from the Jets
Pussy tight and its wet
I'm young, rich and ignorant
Purple mix, kept in and rinse
My life's a movie, so intense
A dead K for the rims
No tints, Supaman flow kid
Goldie bitch I po' pimp
Mack a bitch, then crack her shit
She pop her gum but smack her lips
I spented cash and stack up chips
Get wasted and fuck new chicks
M.O.B until I'm real, pause script

[Verse 1]
Walked up in the court, I'm reekin'
Yeah I'm reekin' now I'm blinging
Smell like a pound of skunk, you smell like a pound of peaches
I remember trappin', ridin' round in the Regal
Now I pull up in that i8, look like some Adidas
Stripes on my shit so you know you can't beat me
Fredo in the cut like the sore on my fuckin' knee and
Ridin' fast while I'm eatin', my car look like neon
You know I got D-Money, I'm flexin' like I'm Deion
Your weed stepped on, guess what? My shit peed on
I'm hot up in this bitch, someone get some fuckin' Freon
For my air conditionin', it feel like I cut the heat on
You wake up turn your swags on, I wake up turn my heat on
You a lame ass duck nigga, nigga you a peon
I'm coolin' at Leon's my independent kingdom
I pulled up to Harold's, eight piece with some lemon
Pepper on my shit, R. Kelly TP3 on

Only time you going bald is at the barber shop like Eva's (?)
