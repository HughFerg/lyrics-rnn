Bundles

[Verse]
Move just like Jason
Bitch, don't test my patience
Bitch, money my odor
I ball, check my floater
Gold grill in my mouth and my bitch by my side
Nigga, just like The Joker
She love how I stroke her
It's 2AM, I might pop up like the toaster
Pull up, Testarossa, John Gotti the city
Suck on my dick like a string of spaghetti
Ed, Edd and Eddy, pop off like confetti
These niggas ain't ready, I'on't give a fuck
One call, they kick in your door for a couple bucks
She talkin' guala then bitch nigga shut it up, flood it up
White wrists look like the light on a Jeep truck
G shit, nigga, I see shit
Pull up in a spaceship
Bitch came from Cali and she came with her face lit
Dick in her mouth, got her cheeks like a fat kid
Make the bankroll bend over like her back did
Run to the money like a mothafuckin' track kid
Bitch head so big, had to call her lemonhead
Get it in, get it out, just like Diner Dash
Ass so fat and her waist so thin
She was blamin' it on SlimFast
Youngest in the room but I prolly got the most cash
Walk in the club and Lil Boat change the forecast
I fuck with that bitch but my bitch got more...

Fuck a job, I can’t work for no nigga
So I block post to stack up the figures

Hollow shells in the nine
Dumped a clip into his spine

I keep bad bitches all around me

They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I made it far so I'm thankin' God
I do not go to no bars, I'm in the car with the stars
I can't pull up, I can't park if it ain't valet
I'm in Houston with a bitch and her friend, she gay
She don't suck dick, but tonight it's all in her mouth
I just fucked a bitch who supposed to be my godsis

And if you owe me, I need taxes like I'm Uncle Sam

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I keep bad bitches all around me

Got my homeboys, got my homegirls
Fuck these haters, I keep living in my own world
I get money, I flip money on my own tours
Own my coupe, skrrt, skrrt, you don't own yours
Champagne in the sky just to toast up in it
Dubs up high, rep the coast up in it
Deuce deuce, two two, go and add both digits
Woo, woo, I had to bring the 4 up in it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight

[Verse 3: YG]
Ayo, I fuck with Lil Yachty, I fuck with Lil Yachty

Don't worry about these niggas, your shit poppin' every party
Yeah I started from the bottom, the low

 [Chorus]
I done lived my life long enough to know
Everybody not as real as they say
Miscellaneous occasions where I needed you as back up
To pick me back up after the world started to act up, ahhh
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years that's all you had to say
That's all I needed you to say
That's it
That's all you had to say
That's it
That's all you had to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
That's all you had to say

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm back on that bullshit
Back on my number one rule shit
Back on my never not cool shit
Pull up in somethin', that cool whip
It makes a noise like a spaceship
Niggas be faker than facelifts
People switchin' like the late shifts
It's not a secret no more, no
Niggas be actin' like gang
Until you get changed, then they change
Bitches be screamin' my name
From wall to wall, that shit be insane
These niggas not gang
They just wanna go on Instagram and take a lil' photo
Hot on the scene, I just drove off the lot in a brand new four door
I remember moms drove a Volvo
Now mama's ridin' in a Rover
Had to go back to my high school
Look at my teachers like, "I told ya"

[Chorus]
That's all I had to say
That's all I had to say
Uh oh, uh oh
That's all I had to say
That's a message for me
That's all I had to say
If you wasn't really there for me
After all these years, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say

[Outro]
Say, say
That's all you had to say
Say
That's all you had to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years
That's all you had to say
That's all you need to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years
Say, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
You waste my time and you play
No, no, no, no, not today
Say, I'ma be good on my own




 [Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Stay with the map like apple
Talking that shit, have them come in your chapel
Young nigga fly, I can fly pterodactyl
Got a new bitch with a son, he a rascal
I get the bag from the city, the capital
These niggas fake and Lil Boat be the actual
Beefing online but in person you rational
I do not get it
Making this money, it's making them livid
The shit that you rap bout, you know you don’t live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds they wet like a cup of the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic

[Hook: Saca]

You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members, what's up and I’m on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, that’s not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu'
Plotting on ways to build up revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player, check the attributes
Ben ’bout the guap since I had sessions too
Know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won't catch me lacking, I stay with the truth
Shoot night roofs, and a light handed loops
Shoot, shoot, shoot

[Hook: Saca]
I ain't with the same shit (nope)
Anarchy, that's what I came with (woah)

Damn my neck clearer than water
Old heads go hide all your daughters
Boat cannot be the father
I used a condom, I did
Baby said swallow my kid
I cannot front on a bitch

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal
And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show
Ayy, just like an art show
Nut on her face, paint up her face, just like an art show
Woah, just like an art show
Call it the art show, bitch it's the art show

[Verse 2]
Hmm, bitch fuck your daddy he don't want you with a boss
I met your mama and she hated how I floss
She said my style reminded her of Kriss Kross
She said I need to walk around with a cross
I can't have love for no bitch (no)
Watch how I lane switch (yeah)
Watch how I flood the wrist, oh
Damn, that's a flood (that's a flood)
Put that on the hood (put that on the hood)
I'm living good (yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now

Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal

Looking at my wrist and caught the whole flu
Niggas be hyping over the namebrand
Niggas be spending they guap with no gameplan
Niggas been rapping for years and still don't got no fans
Niggas talk down on Boat, they pull up in black vans

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal

Woah, just like an art show

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Off top, niggas know that I'm the shit
Gotta' iced out wrist that could fuck your baddest bitch
Stacking up doe, switching up swerving on foes
Hard top when the rain drop
Candy apple red Ferrari paint
Make these bitches faint
When I walk past to serve their daddy dank
Make them walk the plank on my new Yacht
Motha' fucka' stupid hoe that's a bitch there
I got all of they attention while my wrist glare
Talk slicker, my stack thicker, my dick bigger
What other else reasons do you want baby?
Tell me it would be stupid if you didn't hop in this Mercedes
Hella bitches on my line, got my main crazy
Hella' lean in my cup, got my eyes lazy
I've really been on the scene with my niggas baby
Tryina' flip it like it's crack in the late 80's
Got my bitch getting wetter like a vet navy

Stackin' up for that championship ring baby

Walked up in that bitch with two bitches you ain't never seen
Perfect parts got me so clean

Oops I meant vanilla beam
Counting so much money that my fingers started turning green
Winning so damn much that I now here go by as Charlie Sheen
All these hoes is easy bust
In my squad is who i trust
Old ass rappers talking dust, niggas need to die
One time this bitch had hurt my feelings, so i went to ice the pain
VVS my whole team
Ballin' like I'm Larry Bird
Drop that bitch off at the curb
She was asking too much questions
Nah bitch I'm never stressin
Youngest nigga ever flexin
You broke if yo ass stressin
Yo bitch who my ass texting
Fucked yo bitch head, then I told her that she not a slut
Lyin cuz i ain't give no fucks
Drop my nut all on her butt
Xans got my body stuck
Leaning I might need a crutch
Call up K Supreme, and we about to pour a whole eighth
None of you pussy niggas safe
Keep my cash all in a safe
Smoking good and living great
Features come with pricy rates
Living like the Apple State
Nigga, Oooh!

[Hook]
Young RD always had alot of bitches
Pullin up on switches, diamond chain viscious
Hoes loving me cuz I'm balling like a piston
I'm balling like a piston
I'm balling like a piston (2x)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty}​​​​​​
Man, shout out my nigga Christian
She always keep my braids lit
Fuck with her your neck split
Whole gang coming for the top like a volcano
First check and these niggas put they mama in a range rover
Some put in a bankroll
I got old money, I should by my self a Kangol
Got whips like Django and bitches like James Franco
Diamonds dancing hard, so my necklace doing the tango
My bitches look like angels, got stripes like a Bengal




 [Intro: Lil Yachty]
I gotta tell ya Chad, feel good to be back in this bitch
My nigga C.J. in this bitch with me

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I make you niggas uncomfortable, I can tell that y'all truly not feelin' me
12 just kicked in my back door, but my brother already stashed in the ceiling, b
This isn't the first or the second, my nigga this shit right here, this is the trilogy
She off the molly, so she into me
Without the molly, trust me, she still into me
Feelin like Drake with the enemies
Leveled up, I got the energy
You the Castro of catastrophe
I'm in the sky like astronomy, trust me I know y'all not finding me
That pussy is wet like a pond to me
My D.J. is Deano from 6 OD and he spin it back that's the recipe
Got an extra key for locked doors
Where the bad whores get fucked good
9/10 my niggas ain't gonna smoke with you if it ain't no Backwoods
I ran it up like I said I would
I fucked that bitch on the cardboard
All of my niggas from wish-you-woods
They totin' clips like a hard drive

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Money's lookin' good, but now I'm really really ballin'
I was up before but now I'm really really ballin'
Ballin' like a Piston, bitch I'm ballin' like a Piston

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ballin' like the Piston's owner
Why you acting like a loner?
Niggas swear they be "skrr skrr" but when they hop in my whip, they be scared
None of my fights have been fair
Either got jumped
Or I jumped on a player
Took one L in my life but I promise, it won't happen no more
Got the choppa sittin' on the floor
Imma bust in at a nigga nose
I got way too, way too many hoes, chain on my neck, yeah, this shit real gold
I need to start doing more shows
I need to start buying more clothes
I already got a lot of clothes
But nigga I want more clothes
This shit here is flex music (huh)
Nigga gon' and flex to it (huh)
Double cup drinkin' fluids
Flyest shit, nigga you knew it
Nut on her face just like cool whip
Dive in that pussy like pool dip
Alot of these bitches say Yachty is igorant
But I can not change cause that shit is foolish
(Ahhh!)

 [Verse 1]
Loosie, doosie, the jokes on you, I didn't grow up to Boosie
All I care about is feeding my family and getting out of that Camry
I'm in a Benz and I'm getting a Bentley
I'm reading texts from last night, she said "I love how you bent me"
I just bought a Benz and it said "please tint me"
You wanna buy it but you can't
So you're renting, you'll take it back in 6 months
If there's no denting
7K for the for VVS, white diamond dentals
They say "Yachty are you the nigga with the jingle bell rap?"
I'm cool with that, cause every bitch look at my jingle balls now, I fool with that
I finger roll the ABA in
Top floor, penthouse where I'm staying
I grew up watching Even Stevens
Now Steven ain't nearly as even
But I want to thank you for the entertainment that evening
Yeah, we all laughed at you
'Cause we all know you wouldn't say that if you saw me on your avenue
We all know you aren't built for this shit
I was taught "don't you dare buck if you can't back up your shit"
Every time I wake up, someone new is back on my dick
I used to get baffled, now I sit back and laugh like a bitch
Young as fuck and rich as hell, I can't get mad at this shit

[Interlude]
Hold up, let me change the topic real quick

[Verse 2]
We got a fallen soldier on the internet
Don't believe my net worth on the Internet
It's a lot larger, my dream girl's ex boyfriend drive a Charger
So I know I got a chance with that chick
I used dream about bitches who love all this shit
I used to dream about girls who love all the dick
I used to wear gold so fake, now I iced up the wrist
Hold up, aye, uh, aye, uh
Funkmaster Flex please stop talkin' 'bout me
Unless you're finna play my songs then don't talk about me
Uhm, old man, here's a bar
I hope you fall into a hole where there's no sun or stars

[Outro]
Uh, hold on, aye, uh, uh, aye, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I'm gonna stop, stop, stop, stop

Woke up this mornin', bought another car
Too much pressure will smother yah
You know the real niggas don't fuck with yah
We spillin' Ace of Spades on the furniture
And I'll wet a nigga up like a water gun
So many Rollies, got my brother one

Oh, you say it's good

Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better

Let's lay on the hood and look at the stars
And name them whatever
You always call that one Trevor

Let's grow old, rocking chairs and play checkers
I wanna spend my whole life with you
Without you I feel so blue
I probably lose my train of to dos
All my life I always knew

Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
You said I love ya with those eyes so deep
The love you gave me made me feel so sweet
Baby you against the car, you don't deny me
Love the way you love me, I really love you

You so fly
Neighbors always come around
When you got me raining down

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good

 [Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They know I'ma ride with you
Pull up on the avenue in something hardly average
Hope I got no problems with you
Cause I know to bag mine like Ralphs at the fast line
Seventy for a verse, bought a purse and a feature
Shawty said she love my long hair, look like Jesus
I blow through the hundred pack with you baby

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need

[Post-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby, oh
Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I don't want a cheap bitch whinin' 'til she hit a hundred
We get bitches by the dozen, we get bitches by the dozen
That's my breezy, breezy, breezy, that's my buzzin'
Threw the racks for the chains and the watch came flooded

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I made you look better than you was
Run up a stack thicker than some Bloods
Took you straight out the hood, took you out the mud
Just because
You a young hustler, I love how you get it
Go get it, you'll watch how I flip it
You see how I did it, but that's history
You get a million dollar kiss from me
You a diamond, every other bad bitch in this world is more just like a six to me
So come and be rich with me, ride on a Six with me
I run through a hundred pack with you just to let you know that I'm with you

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby

Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need




 [Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They know I'ma ride with you
Pull up on the avenue in something hardly average

I blow through the hundred pack with you baby

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]

[Verse 2: Sinneyy]
I see you grown up now
I wanna get you out the hood now
I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk
You look ready and you look fine
A Inderpendent girl like you should be mine
Flexing on your niggas just in time
1942 tequila and drinking wine
Keep it 100 with you baby
Not seventy,eighty or even ninety?
You were never stunting til' you met a nigga like me
Stop with the fuss with your exs and come with le
I don't get how you keep it real and true
Not like the other women I've been though
There something about you girl
There something about you girl
There something about you girl thats makes you special
LW

And I wanna lay you down and sing every single lullaby

Because everything that she do to me she does to me

So good that I feel wrong and I feel bad
But I feel right soo right, so right
Oh, check up
Oh, oh, oh, check up

Sunny skies

Boot to his face like a motherfuckin' doormat
Yeah, yea-ah, fuck that bitch till I break her lil' back

 [Verse 1: Lil Yatchy]
She said "I can't fuck with him, he way too picky"
I just spilled a pint of lean on all my Dickies
I got 30 bitches in the Appalachians
Mountain, as the time ticks, they acting weirder
Check my tag, the numbers count on all my sweaters
Boy, that's Margiela
Nigga you know you ain't counting cheddar
Ask your baby girl who fuck her better
Bitch it's 20-15, it's Trick Daddy
Whippin' niggas like the slave master
20 karats in my left wrist, I'm a youth pastor
Sliding down your city real slow
Braids out with the rare 'fro
With the platinum teeth, nigga good grief
When a nigga smile all you see is bling
Chef Master when I start up beef
Got these niggas hating cause I mm, damn
Niggas hating cause I'm flexing harder
Quick to run it up like Tiki Barber
Chopper make a nigga think smarter
Chopper make a nigga second guess
Is this nigga here really my nigga, or am I just trying hard to impress?
Hmm, now he thinking
Diamonds sparkle got these niggas blinking
Chardo-Sunday nights, momma drinking
Demon soul inside a holy heaven

[Verse 2: Soop]
I'm in this ditch like a camper
Creeping, late night in I'm a vamper
Don't let my young boys attack you
I'm with that shit like a pamper
They say that they trick but I'm Damper
When I'm in that bed it ain't Tamper
These niggas be creeping like cancer
She jump on my pole like a lancer
I'm red-on-red look like I'm Prancer
Dib and dabbing in the London cabbie, boy that yappa-chopper started thunder clapping
Nigga rah-rah like a dungeon dragon
And a cra-cra if you think you capping
But my 'migos stamping me a newer package
I'ma ship it over to an Egypt palace
Sippin' lean out a golden chalice
While he looking like a fucking salad
You could see the karats in the band of children
I'm across the water looking like a pilgrim
Money, money, what an open feeling
Y'all been watching looking like a thriller
Always street-whippin' looking like I'm Tigger
Boy that new thing looking like Shakira
And she give thanks like we in November

I stay with the drip, put it all in her mouth
New coupe, it came with twin turbo
Sendin' 'em bullets like Tony Romo
Put that bitch on the syrup, it's slow-mo
Pullin' off with the gang in a four door (skrt)
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check it out, uh
I'm with the static like radio, why do your pistol shoot vertical?

[Interlude]
Man, you niggas ain't shootin' at nobody man
You niggas shootin' in air man
All these niggas do is flodge, flake, and beef through texts
Man these niggas is hoes
Niggas ain't gettin' no goddamn money man
And das cap, these niggas ain't, these niggas ain't gettin' no fuckin' money

[Chorus]
Das cap, talkin' online you get papped
My young nigga keep a strap, drive with a strap on his lap
Fuck postin' up in the trap

You mad? Fuck ya' feelings
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'

Okay, I'm tryna fuck a new bitch
I'm tryna make a new flip, hittin' home runs like Chip, huh
Yeah, fuck with a nigga (fuck it)
Fuck with my money, we might have to cut us a nigga
Ain't no debatin' with none of y'all niggas
Twenty two diamonds, that shine in the picture
Menthol, shorty blow dick like Newport (Newport)
Hundred thousand dollars in the Jansport (Jansport)
Stackin' money tall, make a camp fort
Fuck it

[Interlude]
Man, man you know the world would be a lot more truthful if you had to pay a lie man
These niggas be lyin' out they ass man
Just talkin' for no reason

[Chorus]
Das cap, talkin' online you get papped
My young nigga keep a strap, drive with a strap on his lap
Fuck postin' up in the trap

 [Verse 1: Lil Yachty]

Fuck a fake nigga, I can die by myself
I only drive in sport, cuz the faster the better
Basketball seats, I got NBA leather
Shoot a nigga quick, if he fuck with my cheddar
Niggas yelling whip, but they not in the kitchen
Niggas swear they crippin' till they see the blood drippin'
Nah, I don't bang, but I hang with the shooters
They look over me like DJ Esco do future
I say stick to myself, cuz these niggas pussy
Pussys only pussy, don’t you disrespect me for no pussy
I can see it in your eyes, you broke as hell
Sitting, waiting for the day the homie bet you with the bail
We don’t front, you won’t get fronted if you ain’t known
Said your face, car, good but you don’t leave your home
Got this Carly red bitch sittin’ in my home
Ima blow her back out and send her ass home
Ice, neck, wrist, watch crazy though
Ugly black nigga straight snatchin’ hoes
Costa Rica hoes
Put the beam on him now he lookin’ Hindu
I don’t fuck with ‘em, unless they payin’ first
Nigga run up on ‘em with that, 40
Lil Yachty bitch I’m uh, boring


[Verse 2: K$upreme]

Red dot on his head, now he lookin’ Hindu
These niggas fufu
Scottie Pippin 33 shot, aimed right at you
Nigga come through with the purple drink (leanin’)
I be off the goop, I be out the booth
And my backwood, (?) with the boof
Skinny nigga smoke a lotta weed, like I’m Snoop
And I’m chasin dreams, R.I.P. Lil Snupe (Damn)
Pull up in that all blue, pour a four in the muhfuckin’ Mountain Dew
I be high, like the mountains too
I told that bitch to lay it off my roof
Hop in my coupe, let off that roof
And I only want the top, nicknamed your roof


[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]

I’m in LA whippin Reese, sippin juicy juice
Hanging by a noose, on my master shit
Kick him in a pit, on my trojan shit
You niggas make me laugh, on some Seth Rogan shit
Double (?) bitch, yeah ima fold the bitch


[Verse 4: K$upreme]

In my hand a 30 jock
In my hand a 30 Glock, nicknamed it 40 Glock
Meet me fucking kitchen, do you smell what I’m cooking, like the rock




 [Hook: K$urpreme]
Straight out the pot, straight out the drop
Straight to the top, post on the block
Rockin' my socks, eight feet of guap

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty &  K$urpreme]
Fuck up the fuck up
If you so heavy nigga put all your bucks up
Yeah my nigga she stuck up

You niggas can't talk to me wrong
Y'all niggas flex in your songs
Nigga you ain't really goonin'
Nigga you ain't really shootin'
Got your main bitch spoonin '
Somewhere out there on the ocean
You look like the type of nigga that said it is about the motion in the ocean
Not the size of the boat
Lil bitch I'm Boat
Dick deep down her throat
Cause she want that new coat
Put the 40 to his nose ayy, put the 40 to his throat ayy
And my necklace on froze
Raf Simons on my toes
Goop got me moving slow
Watch me whip the fucking snow
Cook the dope up with the stove

[Hook: K$urpreme]
Straight out the pot, straight out the drop
Straight to the top, post on the block
Rockin' my socks, eight feet of guap
Move with the Glock

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Pop in the pussy, it's wet like tsunami gang
Upgrade to platinum on my brand new diamond chain
Met like a sentencing, Boat finna make it rain
Kick down his door if he try me, come find me, I'm ridin'
All of my niggas go Stevie, we might take your TV
She fucked on two xans she though it was a roofy
That bitch acting goofy, I chill with Byou [?]
You chain smoke the loosies
I might pop a sixty deucy
That bitch looking dusty that hoe got the cooties
That bitch she can't  suck me if her teeth ain't pearly
And nutted on her face lookin like a swirly
I like my all my bitches girly, my French fries curly
Running just like Gurley

 [Intro]
Man, I'm on some shit right now
I'm on some, some, some rich nigga shit
Some millionaire shit
'Cause lot of these niggas is pussy
All these niggas is broke
I know these niggas is not doing what they pretend to be
Suck my dick, bitch

[Verse 1]
I don't really care about my enemies
My new crib came with amenities
You gotta pay for my energy
You gotta pay for my ohh, ehh
Don't make me pop up the trunk
Don't make me two hand the pump
Don't make me call up my bro
Pull up in that junk and go dump, dump, dump
I dress so these niggas can see me
I know your lil' bro wanna be me
I know your lil' sister wanna freak me
That's probably why you wanna shoot me
That's why your auntie is a groupie
Send me pictures of her coochie
She said they nicknamed her juicy
'Cause she keep a wet pussy
Pussy nigga don't push me
I pull up deep, not just me
I brought a brand new chain
That shit dance like N-Sync, Justin
I saw your Rolex, brother
That bullshit started rustin'
None of you niggas impress me
None of you niggas would press me
I get more pussy than Preston
My niggas bang red paisley, that's for real
I made a full million off my deal
I made a full 5 out the next
Stupid bitch tried to front on my name
I screenshotted every single text
Bitch I bite like a T-Rex
My future bitch look better than my next
My next bitch look like a top model
She suck dick like a baby bottle

[Interlude]
I'ma tell you like this, man
Youngest nigga in this motherfucker, man
I'm not askin' for your respect
I give a fuck if you fuck with me, nigga
I got M's, nigga
I'm talkin' 'bout the letter before N, nigga
M's, bitch boy

[Verse 2]
I didn't ask for respect, no
All I care about it my check
Louis Vuitton on my sneakers
My main bitch a diva, she is a dick pleaser
Uh, I never miss like I'm Curry
Yeah, can't eat that pussy if it's furry
My bitch pussy pink just like Kirby
My bitch suck it up just like Kirby
She drives whips like it's Kentucky Derby
She tote pistols so no one can hurt me
Don't even try it though
I hit your mama at the Hyatt House
Then I offered her Waffle House
That bitch could never see my penthouse
Shit that's just a fact
I nutted all on her back
I nutted all on her tracks
Slid my black card through her cracks
Nasty young nigga, I'm all in it
Posted on the block in a ball fitted
Posted on the block with the same niggas
I got that guap and it change niggas
Rappin' ass niggas love Dracos
I love the AR 'cause its range different
Ain't supposed to talk about guns
'Cause I gotta lot of shit goin'
I was trying to be the nice guy
Until these niggas thought I was hoein'
These niggas thought I was pussy
I had to show 'em I'm 'bout it
I put that bitch on my Snapchat
Watch how she start feelin' clouted
She gon' suck everyone around me
Fresh as hell like I wash laundry with Bounty
I can't front like I didn't come from my county
I know where I'm from, I'm my daddy's son
I never switched up one time
Pick up that back end now it's ice time
This boujee bitch said that she's hungry
Well stupid lil' bitch it's rice time

[Outro]
Lil' Boat




 Know some niggas who squeal
Got the head pulled back, got it peeled
I remember servin’ pills
I was giving out deals
Back the back fuck up that fuck up
These niggas they hating on Boat cus im stuck up
These niggas keep talking imma pull the truck up
Imma knock the buck up
Make ‘em shut the fuck up
Imma count a hundred hundreds before its over
Imma cop the new chain cost a rover
Makin’ all this good music still sober
And these niggas pussy
And these niggas rookies
And these niggas tryna figure how i did it
And these niggas hating pussy just admit it
And my new tape hot [???]
I won’t eat that kitten if it smell like chicklins




 [Intro: Digital Nas]
Ahem, now last time I talked on a song with Boat, uh
Y'all broke ass niggas was hatin'
Only difference this time is
He surpassed all y'all broke ass niggas

[Verse]
Uh, all day I'm rocked up
Plottin' on a bad bitch to come and suck dick
Cook French toast and clean the bathroom
There's piss all on the floor, bitch, go clean it up
Nigga, soaked in sauce, boy, they fiendin' up
Every night you pussy niggas dream you us
Yeah, you signed a deal but you ain't seein' us
200k, I coulda bought a Bentley Truck
Every pussy nigga at South By, we had to smash on 'em
Niggas say he wanted two verses but he was hella trash but he had cash on him
I'm remember TBT, used to have the CDG, shit was hella flee
Back when all my thoughts were accurate, in an Acura tryna chase a bill
Now I focus hard on closing deals so that when I sign a deal I gross a hundred mil'
Stuck between trying to find friends who want innovation but will still kill
Every day a nigga's mom's callin' a nigga up sayin' a nigga spend too much
Baby girl, I made more guap than the President did in several months
Fuck my annual taxes, coulda bought some land with several cactus
Just looked up in the mirror and I'm gettin' fat, fuck, it's time to practice
My side bitch from Sacramento didn't suck my dick 'til we hit Saks Fifth
But after that, she went 7:30
I knew she would from a little birdy
Head so good, got me unsturdy
Givin' free clout to the unworthy
Goggles on like I'm James Worthy
Couldn't get hard, told her lick it, make sure it's still workin'
Goddamn, Boat you hella wild
Turned your mother into a pedophile
Bet she wanna fuck me
All this gold got me feelin' lucky
My bitch ride with me like the bride of Chuckie
Nigga, run up, get done up
Flexin' to the sun up
Better put your guns up
I wouldn't go toe to toe with you niggas unless it's for guap
Pussy boy, get your funds up
18 years old, I made my first million
Now I'm tryna make 100
Bitch, I'm 19
Watch how I Diddy Bop in my Ice Creams
Finesse that lil' bitch right up out them Gucci chains




 [Hook: Lil Yachty & Pi'erre Bourne]
'Cause she down for me
She don't wanna lose me
She down for me
I got the cheese




 [Verse]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model
We be together forever till we both turn fossil
She's my dream girl, she's my dream girl
She's my dream girl
Where are you now and where to be found
I heard you got a man, but that nigga a clown
He not fly, can't show you 'round
Take you to the town
He can't make you happy
Maybe it's me, hell nah it ain't me
I'm too fleek, not tryna sound cocky
But baby come be with me
You're my goddess in all my dreams
So when I go to sleep I don't wanna wake up
That's why I pour soo much purple in my cup
Your my baby and I need your love

[Hook]
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
Together till-
You're my dream girl, you're my dream
You're my dream, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl

[Bridge]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A, and in my A

You're my dream girl

You're my dream girl and in my A
Where are you now?

[Verse]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet to get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay

Straight for days

Rolls got my wrist it look Burgundy

Baby, you a dime, I put diamonds from your neck to your toe-a
Baby, you worry too much
I get my vibe through your touch
Fuckin' thots, that's not enough
Sleepin' in the whip, no house
No guap, baby girl, huh, that's that real love
Baby, you was riding when things was tough
Baby, you a whole diamond in the rough
You know you're forever mine

I fuck on hoes on the side
But that's just for the neck, girl, no lie
Never had real love, I'm bad at trusting
I just fuck, then I move on, no cuffing
You held it down back when I was out hustling
Tryna turn nothing to something
I know you're special
And I hope you make it big one day
Let these niggas try you, I'm the first with the gunplay
'Member when your moms brought my dog on a Sunday
I've been trippin' lately, need to get out the sunken place
And you super fly, you could walk on a runway
You still mine although I know you hate me
I should have gave you the world, but I fucked up
Late nights on 14th Street givin' butt rubs
I tell myself in my mind that I need that
I see you and I'm scared what you see back
You come around when you want, I don't need that
I've had so much heartbreak that I bleed black

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Love me forever, girl
My mind racin', I'm with you, girl

Huh, yeah, yeah, huh
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah

 [Verse 1]
All night I've been watching you
So tonight, you're leaving with me

It's on now, it's on now
I'm talking the big fancy lights
The star studded nights with me
We forever young
We forever young
We forever young

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

[Chorus]
But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young
We forever young

[Verse 2]
Shining bright under the shining sun
Like moonshine you keep it 99% with me
I'm feeling all your energy
I know you love to vibe with me
I know you love to ride for me
Your favorite thing to say is, "Boat, I love when you're inside of me"
Your love is like a high to me
I love to go out my way to make sure you stay happy
We forever young

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls

And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever

 [Intro: Lil Yachty]
Brrr
Hey, RD bruh, it's Boat, yeah
Hey man you know that nigga Yachty that went on the God damn mornin' show
Niggas try to freestyle
Niggas tryna act like a nigga ain't got it
Like a nigga ain't still got it
Like a nigga ain't really countin' up hundred dollar bills every motherfuckin' day
Like I ain't bossed up bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Stop all that flexin'
Woke up all my niggas, like stop all that restin'
Might have my OG comin' do a little pressing
You niggas is pussy
I see it, I feel it, I know it, I smell it, it's clear
Fuck I look like sippin' beer?
I got 32 bitches back home waitin' on me
Give 32 fucks to a nigga hatin' on me
Got so much ice you'd think my jeweler flaked on me, God damn
Hold on, money so old, check his colon
Knot so fat Ben Franklin like who is you foldin'
Whips so new got these coppers thinkin' it's stolen
So they pull me over and see my teeth golden
It's over, bro keep the chopper on his shoulder
Just paid cash for a Benz, and Moms, a new Rover
Still the youngest nigga sober
Still the richest nigga over on my side of town
I'm still the king with the crown
King of the teens
Show some respect and bow down
Nigga talkin' crazy, he get shot down
Ay, ooh, yeah, ay, ah
How many times I'ma tell ya?
Young nigga I told ya, I told ya, I told ya
I told ya that RD up next
I told you that Boat keep a check
That Yachty could flex, lil bitch
Watch how I flip it
These niggas get mad cause that weight, I just skipped it
Overnight shawty, that pussy, I dipped it
I had to slow it down cause niggas don't get it
Watch how I do it and watch how I did it
Just copped a new watch and, oh boy, have I shitted
Richer than ever
More wise and more clever
Ball so hard I need a letter, put that on my sweater
Lil bitch, lil bitch
Lil nigga, you hate how I switched
26 shit, I dropped that on my wrist
I'm the richest out the group, just like Kris Jenner
All of these niggas beginners
Fuck on that bitch then I skrrt off with spinners in spinners
All of my whips got spinners
Lil Boat, Lil Boat

[Verse 2: JBan$2Turnt]
JBan$, JBan$
Bitch, stop all that flexin'
Spent 10 on my necklace
Name droppin', we pressure
Bitch don't want no pressure
Eat pussy for breakfast
That bitch actin' reckless, drop her off in Texas
My plug, he like Messi
Got bricks out like sushi, nigga you a rookie
Empire, no Cookie
Saw his chain and I took it
Catch you off in traffic, bitch don't want no static
Then don't play like Magic lil bitch
I ball like I'm Kobe but it's 20, Ginobili
My niggas not foldin', talk down, cut you open
My neck is on frozen, Olaf
He put diamonds forever
We shinin', JBan$, he might blind ya, bitch
Talk down and we find ya, bitch
JBan$ keep that iron, bitch
October 30th like Mike Myers, bitch
G-wagon sit on the big tires, bitch
Bitch, bitch, JBan$

[Verse 3: Byou]
Never, never, never, never
Never ate the box like RD and Jimmy
I shoot with the semi, one eye like I’m Fetty
I look out the scope, just give me the scoop
Whenever you ready, his chest like spaghetti
That nigga gon' fold just like a futon
Would tell her jump on my dick but it's too long
I just bought a bunch of groupies with Groupon
Tell me what you want?
Told 'em, told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, hey, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, I keep the chrome in my jeans
Hey, just like a chromosome
Hey, popped it with calicorn
Hey, when I get on, I'ma fuck me a Capricorn
Hey, yuh, yuh, ah, ah
Chubba!

[Verse 4: BigBruthaChubba]
All of my whips got spinners
Chop the brick in half like it's the winter, Deember
Put ah nigga in a blender
All these niggas be pretenders
Pretendin', pretendin'
These niggas ain't winnin'
We still on that mission to get all the blue cheese
We got them clips just like a movie
She suck me up just like a smoothie

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Pussy so gooey, she lick me up after she do me
It's Boat from the Sixer, I'm cut like some scissors
I'm gone off the sizzurp, I hit her from the back
Then hit on that back like she bizzurp
Eat on that pussy like it was some dessert
Minister, sailing team, take him to chizzurch
I don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be snitches
They just want my riches, they just wanna fuck on my bitches
These niggas, they can't
These niggas be jank
I might pull up with a sword like I was Link
Pull up with a sword like 21
Hit the strip club and throw bands just for fun
Lil Boat
Sailing Team

You hold the pistol, that tell me that you 'bout it
You killing someone for me, I don't doubt it
Shut that shit down when a hoe getting rowdy

Need an award for the way that I'm paving
For all these fuck niggas that need them a plan
First class, we gon' look good forever
Sailing Team shawty, put that on my sweater
Red black SLP's like a game of checkers
Where is my check? spent that on my neck
Boat got them old hundreds, that's for real
Thirty thousand on my neck with no deal

Slimey nigga like a nose full of boogers
Free all my robbers and free all my juggers
They think they gon' keep but he'll be out sooner
Free K




 [Chorus]
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over

[Verse 1]
I ain't got time for no diva
Especially when it came from Pleasers
I've got too much ahead of me
Give a fuck about a bitch, I got the recipe
I'm on my way, and ain't no one gettin' in my way
I'm doin' too much, I've done too much

[Chorus]
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over

[Verse 2]
I know you feel salty
You wish you could be over me
You see how I lie, see how I lie, woah
'Cause your new nigga, he broke
Suddenly, I don't have to say it, you just know
It's too easy to see, I know you wish you could be with me
But no, because

[Chorus]
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
So fuck you, you fucked me over

[Outro]
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Know you wish you were with me
Fuck you, you fucked me over

 [Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Better duck from the shells

Leave his ass with stitches if he touch my digits
Pull up to the scene, all you hear is crickets
Buddy went ghost when he saw we wit it
I'm richer now, make a phone call and he'll get you now
Lock down with the same family
Cause all these new niggas be switch arounds
It's Lil Boat, fresher than Scope, gold on my throat
I pledge an oath to stay on my toes, to stay down with my bros

I spend my money on money
You spend your money on clothes
I broke my arm in the bowl
And I get 20 a show
I got my diamonds from L.A
I spent a check on that Rolls
I spent the check on her purse
Then I went bought me a vert
Scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm ridin' 'round the city with a stick
Make this muthfucka fishtail
I get surgical with the pump
Nigga call me Denzel, Training Day
I just might hop on the plane today
My jewelry on, but I'm plain today
Money on me, it might rain today
Give a fuck 'bout what these haters say
Bitch I'm gon' get it
Got a friend with a friend, bitches come wit it
Nut all on her titties, bitches gettin' freaky
These niggas wanna be me, bitch I ball like Bibby

And when I look at my dresser every time I see your thong
And it make me think about when I get you alone

You know that I’ll be there for ya
But you gotta let me know what’s up

Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit just goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya

Put cash in the bag, zips in the bag, lean in the bag
I keep the case in case a nigga want his skull cracked
My nigga Ashton told me to tell ya'll niggas he want his swag back

Whatever you do, wherever you go, just remember I got the bag

[Hook: Lil Yachty]

[Intro: Darnell Boat]
Oh, okay. Where? Oh, you want me to sit right here? Look right there? Okay, alright. I got it
Well, hello folks, Darnell Boat here. Today, I'ma tell you a little story about my two nephews: Lil Yachty and Lil Boat. Well, I don't know where to start. Look, here's Lil Boat now...

[Verse 1: Lil Boat]
Lil Boat!
I got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll
How you do it? Only God know
I want to know who's real until the time fold
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'mma stay down with the same niggas I came up with that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12

[Interlude: Darnell Boat & Lil Yachty]
See, he's a little- he's a little bit more aggressive. Well, you know, as this story unfolds, and--you know what I'm saying--as the story gets told, I'll tell you a little bit more about Yachty. He's a little bit nicer. Let's call him
Hello? Hello?.

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Oh, oh, ohhh
Hello Boat, it's so nice to meet you
I'm so glad you came
Hello, hello
What's poppin'? It's Lil Yachty, I'm in the party
I need three thotties to come suck on my posse
What's poppin'? Woah
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Oh, hello
Welcome to my life
Hello, hello, hello

 [Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on

[Verse 1: Cook Laflare]
I had a hard, hard life, ayy
It's been that way all my life, ayy
I had to earn my stripes, ayy
Had to pay my part, ayy
I know what you're goin' through, ayy
You just want someone to love you, ayy
Feel like there's no one on your team
Had to hit the block when I was 14, ayy
Ayy, since I was a young nigga, I knew what I wanted to be
Like Martin I had a dream, like Martin I had a dream
Watch out for 12, might have to move the trap, heard it's a sting
How could I fold? It's nothin' but solid niggas on my team
Had to weed out the rats, so I can roll up a bag
These broke niggas leeches, just wanna run up a tab
But so long, I'm so gone
Life goes on, life goes on

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I remember bein' broke
Couple dollars in my pocket, I could barely cop a soda
I didn't know what to do
A college kid lost just like everybody else
Up late tryna figure out myself
Mama had no job so I got a 9 to 5
Just when I thought we lost it all
She said, "Boy be strong, God gon' keep us in our home"
Blessings come true, I swear they do
You might be down at the moment
But stay there and you'll be up soon
I know you're tired of the bus
Stack up and pull off like vroom
Stay consistent and watch how your money moves
And watch how your old friends hate on you
But fuck 'em because

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on




 [Intro: Darnell Boat]
Ohhh Boy, where do I start
Darnelle Boat here checking in once again
I just wanna tell y'all
I am so so thankful and appreciative for everyone who has been supporting my nephews
Yachty and boat have been working so hard over this past year and we just want to welcome y'all to Teenage Emotions
Well they both have lots to say they've been working really hard
I think this time Yachty wants to go first

[Verse 1]
I done did a lot this year
Made a lot of friends, some came, some go
And I still never took a sip of beer
Still fuck hoes by the pier
Still ride around without a roof
Still ride around with k$upreme sippin goop
And my managers know lots and lots of goons
So let me know if there's pressure in the room

[Chorus]
I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done had sex with six different whores
At the same time on they grandmother's back porch
Yeah, I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

[Verse 2]
I used to wanna be rich
Now Lil Boat on the Forbes list
And my mom walk around with a frozen wrist
And my sister walk around with the nicest kicks
I used to wanna go far
Now a nigga up in the galaxy
Tryna figure out why these niggas mad at me
Sending shots while I'm livin' so lovely, like a star

[Chorus]
I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

[Bridge]
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
I'm a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star

[Outro: Darnelle Boat]

 [Refrain]
How many niggas you know count that shit up like lil boat?
How many niggas you know get that shit straight off the boat?
Niggas think we ain't balling, shit they better check the score
All of my niggas be shooting, they bust that shit straight at your throat

[Hook]
If you know like a know then you know that I know that niggas be hating

Can't wait 'til I make it
Fuck waiting, shit I'm finna take it

[Verse 1]
Why do these niggas be hating, these niggas be hating, these niggas be hating
I don't give a fuck about the politics, don't give a fuck about debating
Me and my brother be balling like Eli and motherfucking Peyton
All of these diamonds on Yachty, these diamonds on me, all these diamonds be skating
I watch my brother jump out the front door, he whip that pot with that bacon
Aye aye, and my bitch ass fat, I told that bitch never to stop eating bacon
How many niggas you know count that shit up like lil boat?
How many niggas you know get that shit straight off the boat?
Niggas think we ain't balling, shit they better check the score
All of my niggas be shooting, they bust that shit straight at your throat
And they think that everything funny, I see why all these niggas jokes
I sit courtside with my brothers, I sleep in Versace covers
I fuck with that bitch with no rubber, don't give a fuck about another
I promise I do not love her, fuck her then dump her, I do not cuff her, no

[Hook]
If you know like a know then you know that I know that niggas be hating

 Nigga, free Reese, free Nino
The world is mine like I'm Al Pacino
Got more money than a lil' casino
Got caught fuckin' on a bitch and her boyfriend walked in wearin' full Chinos
Hopped out the back door, ran a four flat
That was like way back
Nowadays I just sit and laugh
Chopstick long as one giraffe
And I'm comin' through, clear the whole path
Walked in the damn spot, it was all females nigga, fucked the whole staff
Goddamn, nigga, too playa
Why you hate? 'Cause I'm too rare
Young nigga, I'm a fresh prince, coulda bought a crib out in Bel Air
Fuckin' on a bitch from Delaware
$30,000 on a new coat, call PETA up, gon' and soak it in
Tag still hangin' from it, had it for a year and I ain't even broke it in
Diamond choker so tight, tried to lift it up, shit did not go over chin
In the studio with Migo gang, everything we make is propane
Call ten bitches from the Blue Flame
Fuck 'em all, we ain't even know their name
Front row at the ball game
Who that is dunkin'? Shit, that's what's his name
I don't even fuckin' watch sports but my backyard like a golf course
Niggas hatin', on my dick and shit, I got more guns than a task force
When I talk, my voice kinda high
Niggas hatin' usually sound kinda hoarse
My ex-bitch is built like a horse, she was 27, I was 19
Shawty there was a real stallion
But I ain't trust her, feel like shawty there was wildin'
Young nigga, bitch, I'm QC, you can see this shit through the gold medallion
After this I'm out to Staten Island, got a young bitch, she be really stallin'
My young nigga tote a dirty K, I call him Dirty Dan, he'll flip your van
Kick your door hard as Jackie Chan
Take your chain right up off your nightstand, lil' nigga




 You’ve got Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart
You got Maggie and Santa’s Little Helper to start
At Seven-Forty-Two, in a pink lil' house
Where everything’s coming up Milhouse, D’oh!

Grampa’s yelling at clouds
Willie’s really keeping busy keeping the grounds
Wiggum is commissioner, incompetent officer
And his son Ralph’s doing the un-possible

Springfielders, ask Quimby, there’s plenty
The black one is Carl, the white one is Lenny
So many seasons, you can’t seem to settle on
One, ish longer than Nahasapeemapetilon

Go to Kwik-E-Mart, learn what Apu earns
Hans Moleman was saying boo-urns
Like the Sea Captain, I’m going overboard
I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords

Like Brockman, gimme a Duff, man
I wanna take a Malk but I wanna get drunk, man
Barney’s the barfly at Moe’s who falls
Down while Mike Rotch gives phony calls

Or Otto Mann on “The Bus That Couldn’t Slow Down”
Need a dump truck of money, call Krusty the Clown
Steer clear of Nelson, he’ll laugh at you openly
It’s worse than hearing “Okilly Dokilly”

Flanders, store just for left handers
Bar in the basement, call in Rex Banner
Two sons called Todd and Rod
Whose mom Maude got t-shirt clocked to God

And she’s smoking, like Selma and Patty
Comic Book Guy’s kind of a fatty
Like Fat Tony and Uter with his chocolate
Looking for another? Did you check your pocket?

I’mma school you like Chalmers and Skinner
Serving up steamed hams for dinner
I’m on fire, well, that’s a fallacy
It’s really Aurora Borealis, see?

Burns got a bear and the bear is Bobo
Burns got goons, Crusher and Lowblow
Nothing beats stabbin’ folks with my hobo
Knife, bring back Sheriff Lobo!

Flow so sick, someone call a doctor!
Hibbert is with it but Nick is awful
Hi everybody, it’s Mr. McGreg
With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!

Smithers can’t enter the League of Extra-Horny Gentlemen
There’s Itchy, there’s Scratchy, and there’s Gentle Ben
They’re all animals, call the hound dogs
Which are back like Alf with the Alf Pogs

Arnie Pye, Artie Ziff and Disco Stu
Martin Prince, McBain, Kirk, LuAnn, Lou
Sideshow Bob, Troy McClure, Radioactive Man
Who had a Fallout Boy before the band

I got more lines than Bart with chalk
I spit more lines than Maggie’s talked
That’s 59 names with more to report, Bort
Until next time, “Eat my shorts!”




 Brother locked up for the bricks

By the time I turn 50

 40 acres and a mule, we got tricked




 [Verse 1]
I'm in love with the girl who loves somebody else
And she doesn't pay attention to anybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

[Chorus]
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2]
The time we just spent together
That was the best time we had spent together
That was the first time we had spent together
When you laying in my arms it feels like forever
But when you leave it feels like I'll never see you never

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

[Chorus]
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

[Verse 3]
Red roses, gold skin with your hair
Parted like Moses, I love watching your poses
They posers on the internet, talking 'bout us both, they just vultures
I want your panties wet, wetter than before you were soaker
You a soldier, baby, nothing like that boy, he's a jokester
I know you like me much, but I think you're afraid of the world
They don't like us much, but I'd be proud to call you my girl
I know I ask for much but today, could you rock out those curls?

[Chorus]
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

All I gave him was a teaser, now your dude's a geeker
Mamacita so bonita, but I had to freeze her
It still ain't colder than my car, tell that girl to speed up

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
You're a sneaky one, you thought I didn't know

She's conceited, she thinks everyone's beneath her
But oh no, no-no-no, no you got it all wrong
Who you been lyin' to?
You called us boys at the bar, you're a lyin' crew
You better hope you never see her, if you do, you better run
'Cause she's a street sweeper, she's a heartbreaker, she's a money-taker

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved

Cause it get cold like Minnesota, ridin' 'round on boulders
Money sittin' up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eatin' pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds but that bitch was mighty fine
I got gold all on my necklace, tatted up my arms
Now my mama think I'm reckless, got guns under my mattress
I was juggin since a youngin', free my older cousin Reesey
He from Hamilton not D.C, I rock N.Bs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you're scared of them four walls?
I was strokin' on your sister, she was callin' me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty nice to meet you
I was juggin' off them stacks, countin' up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat!
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them chargers
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy

[Hook]
Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota

You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, riding 'round on boulders
Money sitting up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eating pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds, but that bitch was mighty fine
I got gold all on my necklace, tatted up my arms
Now my mama think I'm reckless, got guns under my mattress
I was jugging since a youngin, free my older cousin Reesey
He from Hamilton, not D.C, I rock NBs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you scared of them four walls?
I was stroking on your sister, she was calling me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty, nice to meet you
I was jugging off them stacks, counting up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them charges
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Migos!)
You need to stay up out the streets if you can't take the heat
When they said Lil Yachty hot, I'm like, "That's him or me?" (Lil Yachty)
Wrist like Minnesota, trapping Coca-Cola
Catching plays, Anquan Boldin
Jug out the hot box, know that it's stolen
Large sizes, all type of narcotics
Woah, got a bankroll in that big body
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
Fuck 12, they can't pull me over
Smoking on gas and that odor
Cook it up then flip it over
You must've forgot it, we 'bout it like soldiers
It's cold but I got my shirt off
Trap niggas can't fall off
Big sack of molly, golf ball
Big sack of molly, golf ball

[Verse 3: Skippa Da Fippa]
I trap in Minnesota like a viking
Flood out the Sky-Dweller, it got good lighting
We made the dab and all of y'all biting
Two thick white bitches, both of 'em dykes
I make a 50 before his acre
I was in the streets but I ain't have no cable
Me and Lil Yachty touch down at the safe house
Skippa Da Flippa, I will bring the rice out

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Cold like Minnesota, racks on fall, I told you
I iced out my Rollie, then did the same damn thing for my brodies
All a nigga trap spot beating like a pulse
I could put the heat inside the kitchen like a baller
I could fill your bitch head up like a lawyer
Ain't know, never 'gon sign posts
Big machine, big machine
I'm cooking bean on jelly beans
No need to smell it all, is clean
That money talking, Charlie Sheen
I'm riding Ubers with the toolie
I got more diamonds than your jeweler
I make her come back like I'm Yugi
If you ain't know it, now you knew it
I aim at her head like a sniper rifle
She can't be my bitch if she dyking, dyking
I bought her a ring but no wifey, wifey
She slurp on that dick and I like it, like it
No candy, she Mike and Ike it
No Nike, she know I do it
I eat that bitch like a hockey pocket
No Nike, she know I do it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat

Moments through the night, I turn to your side
Rub my index finger through your thighs
All of my life, I been feinding for a wife

Right hand gripped with the bun of hair
Waking up without you is such a scare
Gripping on your hips while you hold the chair

I feel your pain
I give you everything
I, I
The deeper I go, you feel in your toes
You know where home is (You know where home is)
Just focus (Just focus)
Are you for this? (Are you for this?)
Are you wasting my time?
Please don't do that
Oh no, no

She used to work hard for us
Now I break my back for her
That's my momma

Smartest girl I know
Pretty enough that if she forgot her wallet at a checkout counter she could pay off her tab with her looks
That’s my momma

Where would I go without my momma?
I love my momma
I need my momma
My best friend
The lady of my life

            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        




 Můj příběh je prostý a začíná tady
Sedím si v hospodě mezi kamarády a
Zrovna když u piva upíjím pěnu
Naproti u baru uvidím ženu

Ta žena je krásná její neskutečný vnady
Mi řikaj' kámo - teď a tady
Tady a teď svůj šarm rozjeď
Kolem prstu si ji vomotej a pak si ji vodveď

Tak vytáhnu kytaru zabrnkám na city
Jeden dva songy - starý dobrý hity
A pak už jen čekám až zvlhnou ji oči a
Úplně hotová mi do náruče skočí

Ale co to je? co se to děje?
No to snad ne snad se nesměje
Proč se tváří jako bych byl ňákej hmyz
Jako by řikala: hele mladej, rychle zmiz
Tvý songy budou nadosmrti staře znít
Pokud v nich nebude hustej rap a vostrej beat

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
Nevim jak se správně řikaj hiphopový mantry

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny vás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele

Můj příběh byl jiný a začal tam kde
Pokud si opravdu dobře vzpomínám
Skončil ten tvůj u kytary a piva
A naproti mně se posadila Iva

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a country

Ty chceš repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny nás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To ti ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svíráš držíš jako ukulele

Ukulele ukulele uuukuuuleeeleee

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a kántry
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a kántry

Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Wabiho i daňka posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele

[Outro]
No I can't trust a soul

No, I never cared
And I think that's why they fuck with me
Cause I stayed down and I kept my original team

Keep that shit cool when I'm fucking on another hoe
Patek Philippe, time I got big boy Pakets and VVS diamonds
You said you the shit, but I know that you lyin'
Diamonds be spicy like cayenne pepper
Young nigga ball like Chris Webber
I need the key to my city or [?] or something
I walk in the spot and I got the bitch jumpin'
This bitch off of the molly, it look like she krumping
Big Bentley coupe, got the whole engine running
Talking, just like a reverend
Nigga I don't drive no Chevron

Woke up in the mornin' got her diamonds, 10 carats
I was in the trap bird singin' no parrots

Free my brother Nino out there servin' crack addicts
Free my brother Nino out there makin' trap magic

Beat the box, no Cassius
My niggas pulllin' up with masters
Came in the world dabbin'
Quavo, Lil Yachty, got fashion
You niggas slower than molasses
Once you eat it up you is an addict
I should have played with the Mavericks
Bricks on a boat, my brother Lil Boat
He wanted it so bad I served him with soap
He wanted it so bad I served him with soap

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
Got so many chains I can swing on a rope
All these broke niggas hatin' on Boat
Pussy niggas need to learn how to cope

Runnin' round with Young Quavo, we with it
All these bitches lookin' at us, they 'bout it
Niggas talkin', said I'm next, I don't doubt it

[Outro: Quavo & Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat and Lil Quavo

When I put that shit on, I can walk in the sky
Danny told gang if he lie to your eye
'Cause them folks lose it, they start switchin' sides
Cussin' went down, all I could say was, "Damn"
Told him you gotta cut loose of your ties
Said this here way before niggas was on

The whip's gettin' bigger, the hoes gettin' badder

Don't gotta take shit now, it's with you, jurassic
Gettin' tatted on E, check the before and after
LL Cool with your main ho, oh

Gotta keep a stick like the Jenga, uh

She kinda slim-thick, she a freak
She got a friend too, and she eats
Suck my 10'2" once a week

Beautiful soul with good energy, I kept it real with you
Never pretended to be anything that I was not
I just want you at my spot, I just want you with me now

Fly you up out of your city, just so that I can look at you
And tell you you pretty, you know

You lookin' so pretty, you act so sadity

Buy you the shoes where the heels red like cherries
And when you havin a bad day

Cheer you up when you be down, we can go run up the town

'Cause being with you is like being on a wild roller coaster ride
How many nights can I go without seeing your pretty face

You’re my little freak, I always want you in my space
Every moment I spend with you, there's nothing I'd erase

K. Swisha

[Pre-Chorus]
I walked up in the party
Feelin' like I'm the man
Every bitch wanted to fuck me
They was geekin' off Xans
Let the party around 3
That wasn't even the plan
But these bitches was so horny
Bro, I had to go in

[Chorus]
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
I'ma cheat on my girlfriend
Who so loyal for some sluts
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked

And fuck the rules
I'ma do whatever I want to
When I say so
I said fuck school
And fuck the rules
I'ma do whatever I want to
When I say so

[Verse 1]
Let me gon' and see what that money do
A 2:30 call is a call for a jiggaboo
I ain't got no time to date on you
Rather write raps than write a paper
Ayy, fuck my college school, they some haters
Ayy, whole squad of hustlas like the movie Takers
Got a bougie yellow bitch, look like vanilla wafers
80 thousand dollars spent on jewelry today
I don't point no fingers, I can do no jury duty
Niggas claimin' that they that they know me but like, really do they?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Pipe up)
I walked up in the party
Feelin' like I'm the man
Every bitch wanted to fuck me

But these bitches was so horny
Bro, I had to go in
(Pipe up)

[Chorus]
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
I'ma cheat on my girlfriend

When I say so
I said fuck school
And fuck the rules
I'ma do whatever I want to

Choppa style, she can't argue with dick in her mouth
Said you strugglin' from the top view at my penthouse
Rollin', rollin', rollin' like a roller coaster
Lil' shawty get wet from that Lil Yachty poster
Before we fuck I gotta lay down a coaster
'Cause she get wet and she suck me like a insect
She my step sister, so I guess that's incest
I could not stop lookin' at those big breasts
Make your next move, your best life's a game of chess

[Pre-Chorus]
(Pipe up)
I walked up in the party
Feelin' like I'm the man
Every bitch wanted to fuck me
They was geekin' off Xans
Let the party around 3
That wasn't even the plan
But these bitches was so horny
Bro, I had to go in
(Pipe up)

[Chorus]
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
I'ma cheat on my girlfriend
Who so loyal for some sluts
My priorities are fucked
My priorities are fucked
I said fuck school
And fuck the rules
I'ma do whatever I want to
When I say so
I said fuck school
And fuck the rules
I'ma do whatever I want to
When I say so

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Only in my jeans, do I see lil' shawty dare

 [Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I'm that nigga bitch, got your main hoe rollin' my swishers
Bitches love Yachty, stackin' paper up so I can buy my stack
Anthrax got my trunt beatin' in my jeans, scratch
I'm too fly, rollin' up this purp got me too high
Double dippin' any bitch I want, them walk it out like I'm D.j Unk
Pull the 9 out and let 'em have it, pillow talkin' niggas swear they faggots
Talkin' 'bout you movin', blowin', countin' guap, boy, your ass cheaper than coin star
Talkin' 'bout you got the xans with the lean need to wake up from the dream
How many times I done told you before that I'm up next?
RD gettin' way too hot, RD gettin' too reckless
I can tell that he fu from the looks of his necklace
Niggas mad cause I'm stackin' guap
Fuck her friend straight for days
Fuck your hand out I got my ways, seein' goofy niggas like an xray
Hangin' out the window with the AK, this the new trap for the fly niggas
They like any of my ride or die nigga, I don't fuck with you that's on god nigga
And if you talkin' down he can catch hollowtips straight to the side nigga
Got the block hot, trail blazer, lemme show you 'round the whole trap baby
Pots and pans near the scale baby, rollin' up a whole 12 baby
I can't fuck with 12 baby, I really been stackin' up lately
Got a white bitch, look like Joseph lately , got the brown whip like a bowl of gravy
I'm a hot boy, these hoes crazy, I could never ever trust 'em

[Verse 2: K$preme]
(I cannot trust 'em)
Stick'em six feet below the ground, nigga better not make a sound
(?), but I still knew the pound
Ballin' soo hard I'm on NBA Bound
(?) now his body can't be found, your shoes drippin' you might fuckin' drown
Servin' pints all around the town, bitch I'm drippin' and dabbin', and right then I'm in the wax
Smokin' thrax, sellin' thrax, pull it out my hat like a magician
I could write you a prescription, lemme stop givin' these niggas descriptions
I make music for the young and dumb, lean in my cup got my body numb
And my blunts fatter than a swollen thumb, damn, I do not drink rum, this purple
Got me geekin' like Steve Urkle, got your bitch out past her curfew
100 pack shawty, now I'm a walkin' lift, and (?) whip the brick
(?) got the whip
Do not try to run cause I got a stick, doggin' niggas just like like Michel Vick
Whippin' soo hard, done sprained my wrist, finessin' soo hard I can't call it quits

Promise they gon' shoot at somethin'
Ya bitch love on me cause my shmoney

Lick that pussy 'til it's squirtin' like a sprinkler spout

 [Chorus: Grace]
Picturing your face and now the moment's lost
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost

You're done for me
You used to keep Lil Boat company
I used to put no one over you
You keep every nigga under me
I used to rock a Metallica t-shirt
You would call it the thunder tee
I stung you hard like a bumblebee
Now I'm left dead with no sympathy
I fucked up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miss my fingers running through your hair
Your bed time stares
Oh your lips would gliss even when you glare
You said you feel it in your chest so scream it like Ric Flair
Let me know it's there
Tell me, do you care?

[Chorus: Grace & (Lil Yachty)]
Picturing your face and now the moment's lost (gang, gang, gang, gang)

You get out the shower and jump on me (drip)
Still drippin' wet from the shower beams (wet)
You smokin' half of the sour dream (smoke)
I count up, knots, we the money team (gang)
I'm up, now you know it
I won't believe it until you show it
Ball like Moses (yeah)
Stop playin', just focus (okay)
Flood your crib with roses (yeah)
All them other niggas clowns
Them niggas bogus
They scared to approach ya
All these bitches roaches compared to you
They don't amount to anything you do
'Cause girl, you stay true
That's why I'm running for you

[Chorus: Grace]
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost

Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost

Teeth gold like a box of butter shea

[Verse 1]
I'm about to kill this scene
Got a Billie Jean by my side
And my wrist on bling blaow
I got pictures in the magazine
Gettin' chauffeured 'round
While my bad bitch smokin' on loud
If you had seen half the shit I've seen
You would prolly fiend, for a taste, for a taste of the clout
Always number 9 on a nigga jeans
Gang, gang so deep walkin' 'round like I'm walkin' with the crowd

[Verse 2]
Every time I wake up, I read silly things
Internet tryna take a nigga, take a nigga out his clout
All these bitches hatin' on a nigga dreams
Tryna make sure they do anything to make sure that I fail
I just hit a lick on the runway
I'll be back before Sunday
Gotta get this money now
My brother used to sleep in a Hyundai
Now he spent about a hundred G's on a fun day, wow
And just when I thought about giving up
I got slapped in the face with a blessing slap like pow
And fresh as hell on my bum day
I look fresher than a nigga do on their b-day, wow

[Chorus]
I want you to say my name, say my, say my name
Say my name, say my, say my name, say my name now
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name

Say my, say my name, say my name right now




 Sbohem a kdybychom se nikdy nesetkali
Bylo to překrásné a bylo toho dost
Sbohem a kdybychom si spolu schůzku dali
Možná že nepřijdem že přijde jiný host

Bylo to překrásné žel všecko má svůj konec
Mlč umíráčku ten smutek já už znám
Polibek kapesník siréna lodní zvonec
Tři čtyři úsměvy a potom zůstat sám

Sbohem a kdybychom si neřekli už více
Ať po nás zůstane maličká památka
Vzdušná jak kapesník prostší než pohlednice
A trochu mámivá jak vůně pozlátka

A jestli viděl jsem co neviděli jiní
Tím lépe vlaštovko jež hledáš rodný chlév
Ukázalas mi jih kde máš své hnízdo v skříni
Tvým osudem je let mým osudem je zpěv

Sbohem a bylo-li to všecko naposledy
Tím hůře mé naděje nic vám nezbude
Chcem-li se setkati nelučme se raděj tedy
Sbohem a šáteček Vyplň se osude!

Niggas hate on me because I live the way I do (yah)
Hatin' on a nigga ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga with a self-made crew (gang)

[Verse]
Took my bitch from D.R. to Peru (uh)
And I'll take my gang from the county to the moon (uh)

Big rocks on my wrist, might see a fish dog, it's real water (Lil Boat!)
Niggas better hide they daughter (uh)

[Chorus]
Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (uh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short 'cause I ain't Jibbs (uh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" adlib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (uh), later I'm in her ribs (uh)
I know she your bitch but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (uh)
Niggas hate on me because I live the way I do (yah)

All these Ms in my account, lift up the truck with a mount
Hittin' home runs like Jeter, 'bout to go cop me a brand new two-seater

Yeah I see everything that happens
You know what I’m saying?

Niggas ain’t me bruh, niggas can’t be me

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Nigga you ain't Uzi, you ain't Carti damn  sure not me
Never on the scene, what you mean, nigga yadda mean
Ballin' like Yao Ming, paint her face, nigga just like Sting
Came up popping beans then I dropped it cause I'm not a fiend
All you niggas wanna be me, rub the pussy for a genie
Your bank account looking teeny, Tina Turner, big burner
Young nigga too rich for a fight, new crib on a kite
Penthouse living large, youse a broke boy rapping bout a dream
You ain't never shot the steam, stop lying to the teens
Big Benz too clean, three thousand dollar jeans
Three times three nine in my jeans spent that on my sister
Ghost ride the older Fisker, ball hard like Derek Fisher
Riding round with my niggas, riding round with my niggas
All my niggas do is

[Hook: Sailing Team]

 [Intro: Lil Yachty]
You a pussy fuck nigga
That's why i fucked yo' hoe
You a bonified bitch nigga
Hang around with them snitch niggas
Don't come to my hood the 6 block where I ditch niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just stole a 18 karat diamond from your girl
N.A.Z against the world
Niggas talk crazy run up on his moms at the store
Hit her with the AK
Watch her brains hit the floor
Pull up gang galore
Raw dog a bitch
Give a fuck bout a whore
Bad little bitch she came straight from Singapore
And she wrap bricks better than my Asian whore
Diamond rings on me got me feel like Mike Tyson 99's world tour
I could never give a fuck I said that shit straight from the core
I remember when a nigga ass was dead poor
Now I bust jugs and make more money than before
Big bad wolf and this bitch kicking down your door
All these niggas washed up I found them on the shore

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Fee
Fi
Fo
Fum
I just want the dollars
I can't fuck with no nigga I just want my guala
I said I just fucked a bitch and all the neighbors heard her hollar
Tried to fuck with college  but Lil Yachty ain't a scholar
I said I just want the dollars
I just want the dollars nigga

 [Intro: Lil Yachty & Jamie Foxx]
Takeoff
Yo Pi'erre you wanna come out here?

[Verse]
Bust a nigga brain if he try to take a chain (gang)
22 chains and they all say my name
Gang gang gang give a fuck about a bitch (fuck her)
75 karats in my new necklace (nah for real)
We don't give a damn about a bitch (aye)
We don't give a damn about a bitch (aye)
Middle fingers up fuck a nigga and his clique (fuck 'em)
I bet that pussy nigga won't come around me with his bitch (niggas scared)
I take a nigga bitch (gang gang)
Watch on my wrist out of date but it glist
Jimmy Pang on my gang is off the chain for real
High school I spent most my days off the pill
Real talk I probably could't tell you how it feel
But I know how it feels to be rich cause I am (for real)

[Hook]
Still don't give a damn about a bitch (fuck 'em)
Still don't give a fuck about a bitch (fuck 'em, aye, gang gang)
Still don't give a damn about a bitch
Put your middle finger up fuck a nigga and his clique (gang gang gang gang)
Still wont give a dollar to a hoe
Fuck these pussy niggas they ain't bro (facts)
Fuck these pussy niggas they ain't gang
Niggas walking around with they fake diamond chains

It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
It seems like everywhere I walk they all look and talk like RD
They wanna be me
Shit like leadin’ the blind, all these niggas Stevie
They copy NAZ, these niggas wannabe
I just might aim the chopper tonight
And I store my ice right by the fuckin' Häagen-Dazs
Them niggas sweet as pie
Never will I rock with that shit up on my guys
Talk down I let it fly, gold teeth catch a bitches eye

[Hook: Lil Yachty and Larry League x2]
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones

[Verse 2: Larry LoudPack]
She lookin' at me cause she know I got a wallet
You got the drank on me, put it in my goblet
Just let me fold it, keep my pockets on flawless
I’m smoking leaves man it’s too easy, feel like autumn
My shit movin' faster than I’m sellin' it
I know they weak boy, got no skeleton
Do not ask me if you relevant
I’m shinin' on these fakers in my lemon whip

[Hook: Lil Yachty and Larry League x2]
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang

They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)

[Verse 3: DJ Dolphin Tits]
In a white whip, boy I look like Gandalf
Slide that ring on your girls finger, take off
Northside, my guys know I never stop
We pull up to the spot then we make it pop
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
Then we make it pop, then we make it pop
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
Then we make it pop
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)

But niggas can't do what we do
