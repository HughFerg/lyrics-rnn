[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't ever been worn
Recievin' the package we sell out the dorm
Sky-dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch come and see me like 5 in the morning
We carry these .223s like we the army
Haa, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
And I know we selling out like the Jordan's
Cashing out new 'Miri's, thousand at Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
This is a Bentley bitch, this not a Lexus
You beat me to the club like a domestic
I came to the club and they gave me a section
Hop in my truck and my truck all matte black
Saint Laurent trench coat, Rick Owen my jacket
Pull up I lamb it, No I won't crash it
Rock star lifestyle like my name Lenny Kravitz
Cartier diamonds, the frame in my glasses
No no no, you can not get these lens crafters
I shook his hand I was smiling and laughing
We killed that nigga, came out like what happened (what happened)
What happened lil nigga, what happened
It's Mr. geeked up, I'm never not laughing
I stay with my twin like my name is Shannon
Black in my fish, no pink call it salmon (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in the size of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't ever been worn
Recievin' the package we sell out the dorm
Sky-dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch come and see me like 5 in the morning
We carry these .223s like we the army
Haa, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like the Jordan's
Cashing out New Miri's, thousand at Barneys?
You gon' swallow this cum fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Pussy cool but her head is retarded
Make one false move and your head is a target (target)
Lot of drip and I still ain't rewarded
Still ball with my crew like I play with the hornets
Rage EDM like my bro DJ Carnage
I can walk in Magic turn the weather to stormy
These four bitches wanna give me an orgy
You hear the horses when we runnin' these Porches
Drop the top off it like I get sore
Come see the paint on my Christian Dior
Comin' up really had this shit hard
Now bet you won't see me shoppin' in Zara
Went straight on the white, I got hard
60 whole rounds and that mini-AR
Comin' up some of my dogs caught the yard
Now I got one I got me A&Rs

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't ever been worn
Recievin' the package we sell out the dorm
Sky-dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch come and see me like 5 in the morning
We carry these .223s like we the army
Haa, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
And I know we selling out like the Jordan's
Cashing out new 'Miri's, thousand at Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it




 [Hook]
Baby got ass in them jeans
Baby got ass in them jeans
Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave
And I got some racks, pocket full of green
VVS set, cost a (?)

[Verse 1]
Pull up in a droptop looking all clean
And I got on Off-White looking like cream
She say she wanna fuck and suck me with no strings
Leaning on the X tryna balance it with weed
Think about flying to Belize
Take a nigga bitch and I let her fly with me
But I will never ever ever let her get between
Mob ties
New lights on the Benz looking cock eyed
On the southside
In the coupe sippin' lean, eating Popeyes
Got a Glock
Young nigga MOB had to pop off
Shit'll get hostile
Make a nigga her star
Any given time and
Rolls Rolex not the Timex
She living like an omelette
Word on the street nigga I'm next
Whip it like a Pyrex
I can take a lot of jets
Fuck a hoe, we gon' have a lot of sex
We gon' count a lot of checks

[Hook]
Baby got ass in them jeans

Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline

[Verse 2]
Now the big booty bitch sucking my soul
Still rocking Off-White, Mr. VLone
Freaky lil' bitch tryna follow me home
Told the lil foe I could smell his cologne
I was just smoking me a zone
Got on all gold but I'mma tote me some chrome
And a hunnid racks on a show now we on
Huncho!
New 2020 Benz need it pronto
With a thick hoe
We in NYC smoking Fonto
Gotta deep throat
Make a nigga run in the Chanel store
I let her bring her friend over
We go and fuck the gun store
I gotta keep a Latex
Fuckin' on a thot having safe sex
A nigga never play that
Running up and down counting paychecks
Racks I'mma make that
I made it out the projects
Poppin' that nigga, never had shit
Now a nigga fly jets

[Hook]
Baby got ass in them jeans

Lemme see you bounce, like a trampoline
Dickin' you down, grabbing your weave

[Chorus: Gunna]
Whippin' that Masi, pay me for the party
I don't wear Ed Hardy, got drip on my body
Ten thousand ones for these strippers in Follies
Codeine I sip while I'm smoking exotic
Working like Gotti, my crew almighty
No TGI Fridays, eat five-star, we dining
All of my bitches want VVS diamonds
Throw racks in the club and start changing the climate

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Oh, H 'round my waist, I'm back rocking Hermes
Givenchy Air Forces, they cost me a bag

I eat the cake too, brought my bitch to the sand
I geek up my whips and live life on the edge
Slime out of town so I'm sipping this red
I cannot cap, these racks getting to my head
Young Gunna rappin', I really was trappin'
My wrist need a napkin, Rolex got me wet
Drip they gon' jack it, Marc Jacobs my jacket

Givenchy stars got me fucking a model
Poppin' seals, we don't drink bottles

Snakes in the garden, my Gucci Mufasa
Pablo Juan bitch, I'm the plug like a charger

[Chorus: Gunna]
Whippin' that Masi, pay me for the party

[Outro: Young Jordan]
Woah, slatt




 [Chorus]
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach should've came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah

[Verse 1]
Oh, Wheezy the wave, need a board yeah
Them bricks when you make it on Forbes, yeah
We winnin', stop checkin' the score, yeah
We can live with no warning
Spur of the moment
But it's war if you want it
Get too much of this money, buyin' too many guns, they treat me like a god
Too many keys to these exotic cars
Too many freaks, I been fuckin' a foreign
If you niggas fly then I must be airborne
Won't pay you no mind and they gon' pay you more
Hopped in the coupe, let the Tesla charge
I keep the strap 'cause I really be knownin'
I can't imagine my family poor
But I can see my mama in Dior
We walk inside and they closin' the store
You niggas ain't drippin' like Gunna the boy
Geekin' up and it's already a sport
Jeep and it's clanging, the engine it roaring
Fiending so much I don't know what to pour
In middle school when I jumped off the porch
Good in the hood, had to dodge all the narcs
I made it out, gotta live with some scars
Protectin' your family, you gotta go hard
The way my drip set, that shit come with a scar

[Chorus]
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach should've came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah

[Verse 2]
Wheezy wave, I got a board
Balmains cut like a sword
I'm drippin' sauce like it's sore
I'm one of the owners
Car not a loaner
I want carats and pointers
I really fuck with lil shawty, I pay for whatever she order
My brothers get jammed, we cash out on a lawyer
Gunna always have your back like a spoiler
Some happen, I gotta look out for your daughter
You cappin', I'm rappin' my shit, you ignorin'
Saving the profit, our business is growin'
They felt sunny days and they wish for a storm
Fly in the sky, young nigga airborne
Wire in the cab, money coming out sores
I really trapped out that Honda Accord
My chopper my pillow when I'm in the war
Blue hundreds my reason, lil nigga what's yours?
She tell me she cummin', I'm strokin' it more
Thinkin' that time we go big like the Hulk
Feel me, you thought I wouldn't make it at all
Get rich and I still gotta duck all the law
Shut the fuck up, I don't need you to talk
I ran up the millions just watching you walk
You never gon' win when you droppin' the salt

[Chorus]
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach should've came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah




 [Chorus: Gunna]
Going back and forth with these hoes
I told you I drip with these clothes
'Bout to get back on the road
Bigger back end at these shows
I done came from the bottom with hope
Stack that cash up, that's all that I know
Gotta get my family a new home
Gotta go and cash out on the road

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Choke the game I got it in a yoke
My auntie used to play with that coke
I love her 'cause she kept me with hope
Boutta run that shit up like Lil Boat
This a checkerboard Damier coat
Saint Laurent  these the same color as oak
Rock Off-White still look light like the Pope
Momma told me, "that's all that she wrote"
Hopping out of these suicide doors
Got some tailor made drip on my clothes
Run that new in and out with the old
Valentino on all of my hoes
Niggas jealous they wanna be known
I know you can do better on yo own
I see basically niggas is clones
You play wrong, you get popped in yo dome
I'm just trying bring these m&m's home
I'mma try put my lil' niggas on
I don't care if you feel it or don't
Gotta get in that billionaire mode
You can't come to come kick it you told
That's a price on yo head 'till you gone
Better pray up and live with that tome
Can't go back and you know how it go

[Chorus: Gunna]
Going back and forth with these hoes
I told you I drip with these clothes

Stack that cash up, that's all that I know
Gotta get my family a new home
Gotta go and cash out on the road

I'm in the trap spot just like a vendor
Go back and forth with these hoes

A hunnid thousand got my neck on froze

I'm rocking Louis V head to toe
Wake up, I dress like I got a show

Fuck on that bitch and then I gotta go

[Chorus: Gunna]
Going back and forth with these hoes
I told you I drip with these clothes

Gotta get my family a new home
Gotta go and cash out on the road

She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast

[Verse 2]
Ayy, too many chains like a slave
Told my bitches behave
I'ma take this shit to the grave
You stand in line for the J's
I was tryna cop some new Ye
They told me Gunna Gunna you the wave
Now I'm tryna go and catch a play
And I hadda good day
Told my bitch she slay
Barber never gave me no fade
But a nigga down to catch a fade
Treat him like a meal, he a plate
I ride around with them snakes
And all my niggas gon' shake
All my niggas livin' off fate
I'm just staying down for the come up
And I'm going hard give it all what it take
Told you was no time to debate
Don't put me on the time I ain't late
Told you I'ma grind for the A
Used to get them pounds from the bay
Niggas better stay down and lay
On the fucking ground in your face

[Chorus]
Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me
She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast




 [Hook: Lil Duke]
Came from the bottom they said we wouldn't make and we gonna show em'
Now I be sellin' out shows and they turnin' up when we perform
Look at me now, just look at me now bitch I'm on
Ride with my niggas if they right or wrong
And I'm geeked up poured a deuce in the John
Niggas be acting these niggas ain't realer than me

Robbed on yo ass like I rode on the beat
Leave yo ass dead in the street

She sucked my dick and gave me a concussion

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
Now I'm in the foreign right now saucin' drop-top with no shoes on
And we not planning on losing
Don't play with your life you gon' lose it

Run off with that work than I'm gunnnin' him down
She only squirt when I'm coming around
Move like a king where the fuck is my crown
You try to compete you might fuck round and drown
Been have the weight we been runnin' through pounds
Jugg all the work we the talk of the town
Chillin' it ain't never bosses around
You can't live my life but you talkin' about it
She want Chanel just to walk around
I been had lost my heart in lost and found
I got the mojo like Austin Powers
Kill a fuck nigga than send him some flowers
I'm geeked up right now and I'm high as a tower
I'm tryna win and make my momma prouder

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Came from the bottom they said we wouldn't make and we gonna show em'

 [Hook]
I made a 100 today
Look at my Rollie when I need a date
There's flawless VS's inside of the face
I see the stars inside of the Wraith
I went for the cup but I'm still in LA
Pray to the Lord that I beat my case
I pour up a four and I go outer space
Can't go back and forth, ain't no time to debate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
I ain't got no feelings, I don't feel the fakes
I keep a Glock 40 on side of my waist
My plug get that work and it slip out of state
I pop me a perc and now I'm in a daze
I ain't got no pressure and I'm tired of waiting
I bought a big house that's surround with a gate
I moved out the hood, made sure Momma straight

[Verse 1]
I cannot stop, I gotta keep going
I can't go off, I gotta stay on
These niggas fake, these niggas fraud
We at the top and you niggas boring
Got with the slimes and I started touring
Jumped out the jet, went and copped me a foreign
Four Audemars, finna dip it in water
Go to Saks Fifth I might spend me a quarter
We shit on these niggas and shit on these bitches
My loc on Old Nat cut that dope in the kitchen
I'mma rap on my track, I done make a decision
It used to be Green but now we shop at Lennox
The lean on my face just to help with my vision
Handle my part and I play my position
I use my brain and I pay attention
I'mma sit back, chop up that work up like Beni
Ride in the foreign and no it ain't rented
This a freestyle, it's just the beginning
We just be wilding and we ain't got no limit
Money keep piling and I'ma swim in it
I'm going hard like I'm in the 9th inning
Come through in Forgee no shittin' and pissin'
Bitch I'm a shark, I swim with the fishes
I pray to the God, you know I'm committed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm still in the streets, cause shit can get deep
I gotta keep Meech, Chanel on my feet
My jewelry ain't cheap, I know I'm a beast
I go get that work, watch my niggas eat
I need some more diamonds, my team need some rings
Put ice in my teeth, man I l feel like a king
Red bottoms on with my YSL jeans
I need that drip when I walk on the scene
Look up at a boss when you talking to me
You know this shit cost I can't walk through for free
I pour up that mud and I roll up, get geeked
I heard he ran off on you niggas, you sleep
I made 45 and I break down a P
I bought the whole house, they didn't give me a lease
Run through the week make a hunnid at least
Copped me a coupe, it ain't come with no key
Bitch I be high and I don't get no sleep
That's how I ride when I'm on a beat
I love your vibe let's fuck in the suite
She got her friend fucking on me
The strong gon' survive and these niggas weak
This a freestyle but this shit ain't free
I got crocodile all over my seats
They eat up the style, they get it from me

 [Chorus]
I'm goin' outer space

I'm just tryna dodge the hate
My future's bright as day
They throwin' all kind of shade
I'm goin' to buy the bank
I'm tryna pave the way

[Verse 1]
Hopped on the interstate
I got me some M's to make
Come from where they kill and take
I learned the hard way
Shoot out in broad day
We takin' all aim
I'm just tryna dodge the hate
I might camoflauge the Wraith
I'm drippin' feng shui
I'm Valentino from my head to my feet
Lean is my bombay
I promise I'm putting Chanel on my niece
Up in the way, you can't reach
Your bitch be takin' the D
New sixty-three, AMG
I'm a little 'head of my speech
I'm in the need for speed
I got this beat from Wheezy
My bitch is easy breezy
It's a new drippin' season
I had to be the reason
Girl what I said I mean it
I'm on the syrup, I'm leanin'
You still tryna follow the leader

[Chorus]
I'm goin' outer space
In love with the dead face
I'm steady gainin' weight

I'm tryna pave the way

[Verse 2]
I don't need no leeway
I'm not being cliché
I don't want your cheesecake
Some shit I don't 'ppreciate
Gettin' robbed with the Glock, ayy
That's my compadre
Just bought a new watch
I walk with a walk
They say that I'm hotter
'cause I came with propane
I'm just tryna maintain
I'm not eating lo mein
I know it's a cold game
I'm still rockin' Balmains
I'm tryna remain sane
Buy platinum and gold chains
I smoke out a whole thing
Pour out the whole pint
The spot white as Colgate
You just missed your ho, you too late
I don't really care what you think
I'm in my own lane
I'm poppin' my own mane
It got me a long way

[Chorus]
I'm goin' outer space
In love with the dead face
I'm steady gainin' weight
I'm just tryna dodge the hate
My future's bright as day
They throwin' all kind of shade
I'm goin' to buy the bank
I'm tryna pave the way




 [Chorus]
I call the shots, I'm a coach

It's a pay day nigga, you owe
Lot of diamonds on me, I'm cold
I got fashion on me like Vogue
Whole lotta drip, better leave me alone
My bitch got pink toes
I don't wanna leave it alone
I wanna fuck when I want
Got the piece flooded with stones

We was just livin' wrong
Sip out the pain in the morning

Extended clip, I cannot miss
I took a risk, I done got rich
My jewelry's crisp, shit on your bitch
Ice out your wrist, ayy
Make you a wish, blow me a kiss
I sip the six, bottles of it
I don't get Chris, I'm high as it get
Addys and grits, ayy
Don't play with it
I'm clutchin' all day with it
Smoke 'em and slay with it
AK, SK with me
My homies my backbone
I'm gettin' my racks on
Don't play with it
Better not play with it




 [Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got woodgrain on my Damier Buckle
Cool quarter mill in my Goyard duffle
I won again so you still gotta shuffle
Born with the drip and just learned how to hustle
Look at your bitch through these Dior bifocals
I get me some head, she bend that shit over
They say lately I been lookin' like dollars
Pinstripe high waters, I dress like a golfer
We ride in foreigns, ain't no more Impalas
They ain't have the new born but I got baby bottles
Shoppin' at Barney, I drip like a model
Watch how I drip when I hit that Met Gala
Codeine I sip with my lip, don't get splattered
Doctor told me I got l lean in my bladder
Run through this cash like family don't matter
I got your back, feel the same pain together
Pop off the tag, my palm angels sweater
Baby blue Jag made my mom feel better
Fucked a snow bunny at my show at Coachella
VVS damn they pointers in my bezel
We move too fast, it get slimy as ever
Life is too grimy, I watch for the devil
It's a Rolls Royce, and it comes with umbrellas
2018 and that Porsche Carrera

[Chorus]
Goyard pouch (hey)
Racks in the quarter ounce (hey)
Two accounts (hey)
Large amounts, ooh
Shop around (hey)
Designer down, ooh
Drip or drown (hey)
Drip or drown, ooh

[Verse 2]
Killin' these hoes, need to call paramedics
New Fendi runners, I feel athletic
Run that shit up, bought my partner a Patek
Blowin' this cash, it was times we ain't have it
Got twenty-one bitches, I must be a savage
Cook in the kitchen, the dope smell like acid
Pourin' this Hi-Tech, I'm sippin', relaxin'
Vibes in LA, Gunna fuckin' the baddest
FN it's plastic, put him in a casket
I wiped his nose quickly, pass him a napkin (slime)
Got an addiction, in love with this fashion
Prayin' for all of my bros like we Catholic
Lifetime of hats 'cause you always be cappin'
Niggas ain't eatin', stop cappin', you ain't fastin'
Can't get no sleep 'cause my life is all action
See how shit happened, I made it in rappin'

[Chorus]
Goyard pouch (hey)
Racks in the quarter ounce (hey)
Two accounts (hey)
Large amounts, ooh
Shop around (hey)
Designer down, ooh
Drip or drown (hey)
Drip or drown, ooh

 [Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Two Benzes, one Bentley Coupe, and two Beamers
Think I’m a seamstress, I stay in the cleaners
2k my sweatsuit, I walk with demeanor
Sippin’ on lean, can you tell me who leaner
Showin’ me pics of your ho, I done seen her
Twenty-three racks got me feeling like Tinker
I like your bitch 'cause her pussy look pinker
Made that ho cum with two rings on my fingers
Crocodile seats and my cousin look like he been shippin' packs
And we back, yeah, that’s a fact
Lately I promise I been on my bull
You finna get shot, acting like you cool
Drip to my socks, in Alyx I’m a fool
Sicko my brother, he stay with a tool
If you won’t pop it, boy pass it to Tuan
Flipped in your bitch, dawg her pussy a pond
Feel like a swan laying in the Don Juan
Yeah, I been an artist, but not rap, boy, I con
Fuck these new niggas, I ain’t ‘em, too foreign
My bitch a fairy, she walk with a wand
JBan$ my brother, if I fight, he scuffle
That’s not a joke, that boy can't wait to tussle
TEC-9, no ‘tussin, these stripper hoes bussin’
Lustin’, not lovin’, my guap, bitch, keep buzzin’

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I got woodgrain on my Damier Buckle

Killin' these hoes, need to call paramedics

 [Intro]
Yeah
Young Gunna
Young, ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I pour a four in the Sprite
Gunna control the hype
No gay shit, my clothes is tight
I ride like a motorbike
Moonwalk on my soul like Mike
I'm fuckin' your ho tonight
Yeezy Boost on, I might take a hike
Your shit trash, I don't see why you pipe
Off a gamble, I roll the dice
I know scammers that's known to swipe
Keep a hammer, I know you ain't right
VVS's like frozen ice
Yeah, I know but I still take advice
Need to free all my bros off of rice
Heard them crackers tryna play with your life
Get that dollar and don't drop a dime
That's why they pinning cases
Fuck it, it feel like we made it
Had a bucket now it's a Mercedes
It's Young Gunna the motherfuckin' latest
Ain't no cash shit, I came out the shady
But I walk anywhere on this pavement
Wrap them work then I'm back to the basics
I ain't racist, I fuck on all races
But I see you going places
Hop in that Rari and race it
That's Calamari, I taste it
I'm at the Ori in Vegas
I keep it so real, I can't fake it
I been sippin' that lean, got me lazy
I might stroke on it raw, have a baby
Nigga I shoot the AR like a Haitian

[Chorus]
I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, yeah
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I took that drip to the palace
That drip you couldn't even imagine
This drip it gon' make me a legend
I hop in that coupe, it got gadgets
I got an FN and it's plastic
Not the small face, I'm getting the king Patek
Blue cheese hundreds all over my salad
I got some hoes in Magic
No capping, I know I'm having
I'm throwing your ho, let her have it
I hide the bankroll in the attic
In the safe and I bet you can't hack it
Nothing nice if you touch without asking
You get hit in that Benz four door matic
If you diss you gettin' shot when you lackin'
Used to rock that Ed Hardy jacket
Now it's bumble Balmains cost some rackades
I got hundreds bent up in the basket
I been killing the game with no casket
My lil bro brought the party package
I stay geeked up, I think I'm an addict
I been fucking this freak, I'm her daddy
Think you cuffing it but I been had it
Like the roof with the stars, I'ma put it in park
Had it fuckin' her hard, she don't want me to stop
I been drippin' it all, twenty racks in the mall
We been living it large, had that drip from the start

[Chorus]
I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, yeah
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em
I'm drippin' on 'em, I'm drippin' on 'em




 [Hook]
Imma grind, get this paper
Imma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it

[Verse 1]
Money talks, my favourite conversation
I fuck that money and give it penetration
Private flight came with no invitation
When it come to paper I had to practice patience
Had no transportation, had to use the Marta station
Now we ride in spaceships, inside of the coupe it's spacious
On the jet getting faded, flew out the whole crew to Vegas
Smells like we make it, racks so long from here to Macon
Stood out on these niggas, I'm so outstanding
Had to get rich, couldn't do that shit without planning
When you take a fall nigga don't panic
Gotta give that shit your all, bet you don't fail it

[Hook]
Imma grind, get this paper
Imma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it

[Verse 2]
Told all of my bros we gon be on
Told myself I had to make this shit just on my own
When shit got real, I still had your back when you was wrong
When we get Ms, I'm gon try to bring my nigga home
My Rosetta Stones, nigga sit me on a throne
I just got a dome, then I left that hoe alone
I'm just tryna grind, make a million worth of songs
Cop a Patek for my mum, she gon know her son the don
Got that AP on I feel apologetic
When I fell in love with money that shit was so romantic
Get them racks and cuff em, hide em in the attic
I dun got so high, I dun forgot I had it

[Hook]
Imma grind, get this paper
Imma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it




 [Hook]
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kiss, lips
I hit the club and threw a 10
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch

[Verse 1]
Got 60 shows a nigga goin' in
They sent me to front with a back end
World tour, I'm picking up a 10
We run up that sack when they pack in
You wanna send it, better mail it straight
I could show you, let me demonstrate
Saran wrap it like a dinner plate
You got the truck and I'mma check the date
Get there early, not a minute late
Bust it open, smoke it, meditate
That lean is something I can never waste
That Iley Miley got a bitter taste
We been pouring syrup in a Minute Maid
We far from white but we got plenty K's
We blow this shit up, we the renegade
I bought a house and then went renovate it
My side bitch wanna have a baby
I fuck her good and give her penetration
We fucking smoking, we need ventilation
I'm rocking ice, a nigga really skating
I'm rapping focused, nigga dedicated
I brought the show, look like a masquerade
Shut this shit down like the Central Station

[Hook]
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a 10
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm goin'
I know, I know, I know I keep 'em flowing
I open words and now I speak influence
I'm a boss, I got a strong influence
I went got my chance, I'm a opportunist
I tuck the Glock, nigga not the Ruger
Got 30 shots and nigga I'm the shooter
I put my jewelry in a fucking cooler
I whipped the Benz and then I whipped the Beamer
I told her pick my clothes up at the cleaners
She walk and toot it like a ballerina
She bad as fuck, a nigga barely see her
She shop at Houston in the Galleria
I send her once inside the Beverly Hills
She try take my wallet and spend a mil'
I keep it silent I never tell
I came out that dope hole to give em' hell
Tell me what you want, I got it for sell
When I was 11 I seen a bale
Go 'head run that pack all the way
I copped me some work when I got a scale
And I found a plug in LA
I told him we sendin' it in the mail

[Hook]
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a 10
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch




 [Intro]
If young Metro don't trust you, I'ma shoot you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tryna give you more life (tryna give you more life)
I can see through the spite (I can see through the spite)
Niggas creepin' like mice (creepin' like mice)
I'ma speak through the mic (I'ma speak through the mic)
You gotta be more precise (you gotta be more precise)
You ain't wrong if you right (you ain't wrong if you right)
Had a wonderful night (had a wonderful night)
Paid a hell of a price (paid a hell of a price)
Paid a hell of a price

[Verse 1]
Hopped on a jet, you can't delay the flight
One of the best, ride the beat like a bike
Don't press your tone when you niggas drive by
The stick is so extend, niggas shootin' on sight
I blow through a twenty but that shit was light
When they cut that check, man I gotta do right
Buy up a mansion so wet it was ice
Gonna get everything that I desire
This not a freestyle 'cause this shit in my brain
Prepare for a loss 'cause this shit come with pain
Some niggas fell off and just started getting paid
Made myself a boss, now I hold my own weight
I'm practicing patience, don't know how to wait
Some people just trying, don't got what it take
I talked to the God, he don't make no mistakes
They call me Young Gunna, I might change the game
They call me Young Gunna, I might change the game
Hop in the picture, I might need a frame
I'm tryna free my cuz out the chain gang
I'ma come in and go out with a bang
I'ma come in and go out with a bang
I'ma come in and go out with a bang
Used to be trapping and ducking these raids
Now we count up and get booked for a stage
Now we count up and get booked for a stage
I feel like Uzi, I love her with rage
Ride around town in that Bentley Mulsanne
I wanna shit on my exes today
I wanna shit on my exes today
Spend up them racks and then look at they face
This came from Metro, this shit ain't from Zay
He came to let the beast out of the cage

[Chorus]
Tryna give you more life (tryna give you more life)
I can see through the spite (I can see through the spite)
Niggas creepin' like mice (creepin' like mice)
I'ma speak through the mic (I'ma speak through the mic)
You gotta be more precise (you gotta be more precise)
You ain't wrong if you right (you ain't wrong if you right)
Had a wonderful night (had a wonderful night)
Paid a hell of a price (paid a hell of a price)
Paid a hell of a price

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm a trained killer, copped a new Benz Sprinter
Gunna got his own rhythm, big drip like Godzilla
Glock forty, I'm a hot spitter
Send a nigga to the hospital
Told the crowd make a moshpit
Diamonds water, nigga I'm swimming
I'm the one, yeah I did it
I'm the one that got the car kitted
I been poppin' like a hot skillet
I been rockin' customized shit
I been geeking, man I'm high as a bitch
I be fucking on the Roxy
You lil niggas tryna copy
You should make a nigga cocky

[Chorus]
Tryna give you more life (tryna give you more life)
I can see through the spite (I can see through the spite)
Niggas creepin' like mice (creepin' like mice)
I'ma speak through the mic (I'ma speak through the mic)
You gotta be more precise (you gotta be more precise)
You ain't wrong if you right (you ain't wrong if you right)
Had a wonderful night (had a wonderful night)

 [Chorus]
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a xanny
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure
I up that thing on your click, might cause a hazard
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on [?]
Remember highschool, nigga I was dripping in belly
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali'
In the YSL family, first we established
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage

[Verse 1]
I need D my size
With this drip, bitch better catch me outside
I only want Forgiato rims when I ride
And a fully loaded FN on my side
I know my bro won't lose his hope 'fore I free him out the chain gang
I run with locs, they can get it for the low, these young niggas gang bang
All a real street nigga wanna do is stack it up and maintain
Then jump out 'Rari on these bitches, letting these chains swang
Got some VVS's these ain't VS1
Brand new Balmain boots, nigga don't get stepped on
Got yo main bitch with me holding my left arm
And they wanted me to stop, muhfucker I kept going
Bitch thought she was my girl, had to pass her like Brett Favre
On a brand new G5 taking off like NASA
Wild lil' beast better move on the street like a jaguar
And she'll stress 'till I eat that fish like Alaska

[Chorus]
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a xanny
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure
I up that thing on your click, might cause a hazard
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on [?]
Remember highschool, nigga I was dripping in belly
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali'
In the YSL family, first we established
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage

[Verse 2]
I can't tell no lies
On the private island where we reside
I don't need no stylist with the shit I buy
I put that shit on [?]
I feel like Al Capone, play with me you die
She could type, connect this shit to the ties
New wristwatch, iced my shit 'fore I strive
It came with all lies
Protect my pride

[Chorus]
I popped a bean and I gave my bitch a xanny
I pour up clean out the pint and I don't measure
I up that thing on your click, might cause a hazard
I'm from the old school cut, let's put on [?]
Remember highschool, nigga I was dripping in belly
Now we on private jets, I turned my residence to Cali'
In the YSL family, first we established
Pocket filled with green, nigga that cabbage

 [Chorus: Gunna]
It ain't a facade, I spent some racks on my shoes
I been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels
I walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo
I get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound
Can't get you off my mind, I might die about you
My outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move
The praises to the god, don't believe in voodoo
'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Tell everything but the truth, get nothin' but love from my crew
I guess they hate what you do, pull up in coupes with no roofs
You caught me in a good mood, can't put a spike in my groove
Got more these designer shoes
I drip, I need an award
I built that way for that Porsche, I think I'm on a high horse
YSL, got none' but Hi-Tunes, we kill 'em off, no remorse
I gotta win, I can't lose, I'm tryna feed all my boys
Huh, I paid my dues to these hoes
I got that flame to the torch, young Gunna ball with no court
I hit that trap and quit sports, I give all thanks to the lord
I hit that yo and record, they get that drip from your boy, mmh

[Chorus: Gunna]
It ain't a facade, I spent some racks on my shoes
I been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels
I walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo
I get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound
Can't get you off my mind, I might die about you
My outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move
The praises to the god, don't believe in voodoo
'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Man bag, guns in 'em
Track pants, run in 'em

How you want that Saint Laurent bag and you ain't suckin' no dick
My lil LA bitch got jetlag, she off that coke shit
Fuck that shit, come on shawty
Fuck that Ghost, where the Rari?
None of my niggas, want to party
Them young niggas want to catch a body
We ain't wifing no Chiraq thots
Threesome, them my type of thots
Vegas bitch tried to sell me pussy
Tell that ho like hell no
Main homie's bitch tried to fuck me

 [Chorus: Gunna]
Told you we was gon' be rich
And stack my chips
So much money don't make no sense
I don't know what I spent
Make me wanna cop that Benz
Ride around the town with no tint
Cash in the bag we lit
Smashed and then got in that 'Vette
So much money don't make no sense
I ain't got no friends
Tom Ford all over my lens
Got racks in my pants
Ride with a FN
Got steel like Pakistan
I flew 'cross the map again
Got shows and I got fans
Gotta count them racks again

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I ain't hide my safe in the attic
Smoke weed, sip lean, eat molly, pop xan bitch
Please don't panic
Got a Glock 19 black matte
Gotta ride with that static

YSL getting green like salad
Gunna got a flow, can't get it
Fucking on all these bitches
My diamonds wash all the dishes
You niggas can't reinvent me
Pull up in that foreign, foreign, foreign at the Weston
Fucking on a pedestrian
I got these bitches desperate

[Chorus: Gunna]
Told you we was gon' be rich
And stack my chips

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Told you lil' niggas that we gon' be rich
Run that shit up so much, don't make no sense
Used to ride MARTA now pull up in Benz
Sipping on lean 'bout to fuck up my kidneys
Since a young nigga, been getting it
Quick to turn 10 to a 20
All of these bad bitches they on my dick, I got plenty
Selling out shows and winning
This foreign on me got tint
Riding with a bad lil' bitch
Hop on the highway, she suck on my dick
Diamonds on me and they looking like piss
Mama I told you that we gon' be rich
Gotta keep it real and can't ever switch
I had to stack up my chips
Stuck in the streets, came up off a lick
I had to stay down, stay in my own lane
Mama she told me, "don't go against the grain"
Knew what I been through, you can't feel my pain
Keep it so real that shit run through my vein
Made myself a boss and made me a name
Work in the trap, make the trap go insane
And ain't a damn thing changed, ah

[Chorus: Gunna]
Told you we was gon' be rich
And stack my chips
So much money don't make no sense
I don't know what I spent
Make me wanna cop that Benz
Ride around the town with no tint
Cash in the bag we lit
Smashed and then got in that 'Vette
So much money don't make no sense

 [Chorus: Gunna]
Hear that money talking
I'm in designer walking
I put that money all in
Stack the money by the 10
40 thousand for the lens
From a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win
I hear that money talking
Hear that money calling
I'm in the mall, I'm balling
I gotta keep the carbon
I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six
I'm in the top cockpit

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Spit this shit up out the door
Niggas know I keep the tone
I can do it all alone
Had to do it for my home
Niggas 'till I'm moving on
Got some money on the phone
Got them shows on my own
57 for the shows
Putting rappers on they toes
Cause they know I ain't tote
I can never break the code
I will never ever fold
This some shit I woulda hoped
And then pulled up in a Rolls
Everybody used to kick doors
'Till I pulled up on [?] road, and seen a spot full of yams
I sold my first car and got a half a bag and started breaking down grams
Now I'm texting Uncle Sam
But the fucker started scamming
Now I'm hopping on a gram
Me and Nechie in a Lamb'
Had to show 'em who I am
Had to show 'em who I was
Had to show 'em what I want
Rock star with a bunch
Niggas do it for the front
'Cept you should do it for the ones
Tryna hit like Barry Bonds
Make a million every month

[Chorus: Gunna]
Hear that money talking
I'm in designer walking
I put that money all in
Stack the money by the 10
40 thousand for the lens

Hear that money calling
I'm in the mall, I'm balling
I gotta keep the carbon
I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six
I'm in the top cockpit

[Verse 2: Nechie]
Every time you see I poke my chest out
And my life been looking good but I been stressed out
For them niggas who talking big, you know they chests out
Why the fuck you buy a vest, you want yo head clocked
And when that money talk we cappin' out, what we live now
Killing everything but the kids now, that how it is now
I used to be broke, I walk around with a 10 now
Ready to just spend on anything that I feel now
Through these chrome heart lenses I see it all yeah
I see the hate, I see the fake, I see the flawed yeah
Fuck it we gon' ball yeah
Stevie Wonder, see we getting cake, we getting it all yeah
And we ain't playing with these hoes, cause we don't hear them all yeah
Never fall, I stand tall on it
Shit I just hit the light and cashed out on
I bought a Mulsanne, and a new chain, you niggas too lame
Kicking flavor like I'm Liu Kang from the south but I ain't 2 Chainz

[Chorus: Gunna]
Hear that money talking
I'm in designer walking
I put that money all in
Stack the money by the 10
40 thousand for the lens

I gotta keep the carbon
I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six
I'm in the top cockpit

 [Hook :]
If you Outta Sight, you Outta Mind
You gotta stack, you gotta grind
Im stating facts, these niggas lying
You can't relax and keep wasting time
I want them racks I gotta get mine
Stacking it up, I work with a stride
I went from a deuce, drop down to a nine
I sleep with the stars, I know Ima shine
Same prices for the rent, thats the cost of the kicks
Im stacking up racks, just to make a Hitlist
My nigga El Chapo, he'll chop off ya wrist
Pull up with them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch
But I kept it solid and hard as a brick
Winked at ya bitch, she wanna give me a kiss
Walked in that bitch I was dripping like piss

[Verse 1 :]
Bought an AP, and took my wrist out of the pot
Pop a bottle of Ace, and pour that shit out
Put some diamonds and chandlers all in the spot
How many racks does this young nigga got?
I flew to Dubai, I didn't go to DeVry
Hunnit racks to put the jet in the sky
Time is music, this the best you can buy
I'm dripping bitches, niggas still think they still fly
I think I'm the flyest, I ain't got no stylist
I'm geeked up off Molly, I'm fucking off Cyrus​
I flew with the choppa, I might catch a body
Cause I see these fake niggas through the Cavalli's
I got with my locs and we reunited
These niggas quote poems, and they bitches like it
I didn't turn a hoe, when I got indcited
If I catch a case, then I gotta fight it
My nigga called shawty, he ride with the shottie
We pull up in Rari's, and these niggas don't like us
Smoke weed and sip lean and get money my vices
My friend name is Poison, and I know they shiesty
I pray to the lord and you know that I'm righteous
I need a reward, cause they say I'm the nicest
Got too many bros that gon' roll out the dices
I stay out the way cause niggas like mices

[Hook :]

Walked in that bitch diamonds dripping like piss

[Verse 2 :]
Put the dick in her mouth, and its fuck what ya say
Fuck the law, throw the police away
I blew a 50, cause I had a long day
When it come to money, I done came a long way
I fucked the bitch, but I can't go on no dates
She sucked me loose, I put some nut on her face
Let her see the loft, she wanna fuck at my place
Steady bossin', bitch I'm having my way
Niggas in the trap, but can't get away
But I've been around the world, it feel like I'm touring
I’m living life, I swear I know your life boring
Mama said don't stop, I gotta keep going
Got a house so big, the bed room got an alarm
The necklace cost so much it came with a charm
The diamonds dripping, like the rain when it storm
These niggas say that they looking, well I'm finna' show em
So many acres it look like a farm
23 Million like I'm Michael Jordan
2 or 3 bitches, they wanna come join
Fuck all these bitches, I feel like a Don
I looked in the mirror, I know I'm the one
You ain't gonna shoot, but you carry a gun
Niggas act tough, like I won't bury your son
Had to stay down, stack them racks to the month

[Hook :]
If you Outta Sight, you Outta Mind

 [Chorus]
Tryna find paradise, I ain't tryna see that light
I been prayin' through life, but some things just ain't right
We ball every Saturday night, takin' private long flights
I been covered in ice, money stay on my mind
Gotta get paid, gon' get paid
Gon' get paid, gon' get paid, ooh

[Verse 1]
I got real hundreds in the brief
Lately I ain't been gettin' no sleep
Why the pain it make me weak
I got dope in my IV
I can't patiently wait
I'm securing all my needs
Hundred way to go get paid
That's the subject they should teach
Went to school, checked out my niece, I missed her face
Workin' in these streets, hard for my family to reach
Still they searchin', tryna see, make a way
The motto is to get paid, stack a dollar every day

[Chorus]
Tryna find paradise, I ain't tryna see that light
I been prayin' through life, but some things just ain't right
We ball every Saturday night, takin' private long flights
I been covered in ice, money stay on my mind
Gotta get paid, gon' get paid
Gon' get paid, gon' get paid, ooh

[Verse 2]
Rockin' iced out Cuban links
Cartiers, I still can't see
Dodgin' money laundry
Wash the cash, it came back clean
Gucci pinstripes, not no jeans
Gucci collar, bumblebees
My lock be double-G's
Rockin' highwaters up to my knees
Talk to god when I get on my knees
Thank the lord, we pray
Mama got a smile on her face
All of my niggas is straight
Came off the top of that A, my name hold weight
Money growin' like my age
Partner 'nem seein' better days

[Chorus]
Tryna find paradise, I ain't tryna see that light
I been prayin' through life, but some things just ain't right
We ball every Saturday night, takin' private long flights
I been covered in ice, money stay on my mind
Gotta get paid, gon' get paid
Gon' get paid, gon' get paid, ooh

No more racks in these YSL jeans
Pour that Act and I lean
I do this shit for my team
I told you that we would achieve
That they think we living a dream
Cop me a 'Rari and cop a Range
I fucked the bitch and forgot her name
Ain't a OG but I got some stain
My young nigga'll blow out ya fucking brain
I got me a watch, had to cop a chain
I can't lie man, I still got a lot of pain
My nigga got caught tryna rob a bank
Swear I miss ya, I put that on everything
I'mma walk in that club, I'mma make it rain
I'mma change the climate, make it thunderstorm
I'mma go put some more water on my arm
Got them diamonds that shine like the Armor All
Get on my knees and I gotta pray to the Lord
Had to choose if I want to be rich or poor
And I lift the doors up on Aventador
I had some but a young nigga wanted more

[Chorus]
Pull up and park the car
My wrist look like aqua
I get higher than an astronaut
I look like a pop star
Can't fuck with the cops now
I can't be a opp now
You can pop like a Pop-Tart
Thank God I done got far
These bitches keep saying my name

And I drive it fast

I'm just gettin' in my bag my nigga
Calculating and adding these figures (mmm)
My lil' bitch bad and attentive
I told PR to pass the skittles
I just popped me a half, my nigga (mmm)
That's my partner, my slime, my nigga
I locked in with my kind my nigga
I ain't have to go out, I hit her
They gone pull up and ride
Yo bitch keep on eyeing a nigga
I can't stop her from liking these pictures
I hope all of my bitches get richer

[Chorus]
I need a rich bitch

You gone spray it? Then spray my nigga
We gone pull up with Ks, extensions
You gone work and get paid my nigga

Had to go make my own decision
I didn't do this for no attention
I just wanted to see more of these benjis
(Mm)

Now it's small shopping bags and Fendi
Take it off for a glass of henny
Fuck your ho, give her back
YSL can't stop bagging these bitches
Like we switched from the gas to the midget
Gunna havin' these hoes like Hendrix

[Chorus]
I need a rich bitch

Walk inside the mall and get me something to wear
Bitch I came from the sub I could never care
I was fucked up and broke, you was never there
What the fuck is a friend
They ain't got a hand they could lend
Last time I fell to the pen
I had to commit a sin
I dropped the ball and now I got it back
I went to jail and I ain't goin' back
I kept it solid, niggas knowing that
I'mma go the trap, run me up a sack
I'mma go the trap, run me up a sack
I'mma go the house, try to stack a bank
I'mma pull on the block, roll me up some dank

Remember I used to be poor
I can't stop it, I keep getting more
I can't stop it, I keep getting more
I see hoes when I walk through the door
Get them racks, put the safe in a floor

It's their dreams and they try to sell hope
I sold lean and I tried to sell coke
I'm 6-0 bitch I run with the locs
Louis V checkerboard on my coat

[Hook]

Secure that vibe at all times
Forgot that bitch, got Alzheimer's
Got white, got blue, got black diamonds
Go cash out nigga, I'm a big timer

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I done woke up and brought that bag out
Why the fuck my bitch want twenty-five hundred for a ass shot?
If you turn, turn around, got diamonds on her fingers and her hand now
I pulled straight up to the doctor, nigga I cashed out
Gotta keep my cool, stay cautious, I got fans now
You niggas trying hard to fit in, nigga watch me stand out
I had to take a sip of the lean just to wash my xan down
If I pull up with that chopper it's a man down
These bitches want vibes

Diamonds they hittin' the finger, these bitches gon' recognize
Whippin' it like it deserve it, brick everything dime to dimes

 [Chorus]
Peel out the lot in that four door new Masi'
Pull up with that bag and we 'bout to go shopping
Walk inside Sacs and we know that I'm copping
I got some Tom Ford, Dior, and Zanotti
I got twenty whores inside of the lobby
That Rolls a two door, it's still a big body
Treat my niggas like royalty, we not divided
I'll count up some more, make sure that we got it

[Verse 1]
I had to grind and this shit don't come free
Lock up the whole house when I broke down a P
Got mine out the streets and I brought home a feast
I do it for my fam, don't just do it for me
When I took a loss, man that made me a beast
They calling your name, but that shit still a lease
They'll let niggas pop but don't pop shit on me
I'll cut your shit top, leave your brains in the seat
No more baby bottles, we pour out the pint
I bust in her mouth, flew her back to the bay
That Wraith make me feel like I'm floating in space
I went to Old Nat now I'm back in LA
I still got that Rolex to keep up the day
Gon' shine on these hoes like the middle of May
We only pour four just to see how it tastes
I got me a K and ain't nobody safe
I'm putting dick in his bitch, so I know why he hate
When he got on the plate, he was already ate
Before that bag was already made
I got me some racks but there's more I can make
Stones in my wrist, put a stone in my face
Treat that bitch like a fish and I give her some bait
Label they calling, they wan' know my rate
Shout out Offset cause bitch I beat the case

[Chorus]
Peel out the lot in that four door new Masi'
Pull up with that bag and we 'bout to go shopping
Walk inside Sacs and we know that I'm copping
I got some Tom Ford, Dior, and Zanotti
I got twenty whores inside of the lobby
That Rolls a two door, it's still a big body
Treat my niggas like royalty, we not divided
I'll count up some more, make sure that we got it

[Verse 2]
Before hit the awards, man I pop me some molly
That shit was so pure, had me itching and rocking
Then poured up some Tech, had me leaning and scratching
And a half of a xan just to help me relax
And I pulled that lil' hoe she was from Calabasas
Don't know her real name but she looked like that action
Took her to the room, we couldn't go to the mansion
And then dropped her off with my locs who on Stanton
Stunting that bitch must've thought she was Kourtney Kardashian
I hit and I run like a muhfucking accident
Pulled up to the spot, don't see nun' but some packages
And I got some Sprite finna mix 'em with Actavis
Po-pour it up, make sure it Act in it
Pull up with that stick shoot it rapidly
Bang yo shit out with the accuracy
Call up a cop it's a emergency
Got some racks and I'm feeding my family
Fuck all you hoes who abandoned me
They slandered my name, tried to damage me
All of that hate brought me currency
I woke niggas up, never heard of me
I heard niggas say they gon' murder me
Pull up with the stick, look like 30 deep
Peel off in that lot in that new GT

[Chorus]
Peel out the lot in that four door new Masi'
Pull up with that bag and we 'bout to go shopping
Walk inside Sacs and we know that I'm copping
I got some Tom Ford, Dior, and Zanotti
I got twenty whores inside of the lobby
That Rolls a two door, it's still a big body
Treat my niggas like royalty, we not divided
I'll count up some more, make sure that we got it




 [Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back Turbo
Baby

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I love that blue race
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 1: Gunna]
'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' this rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two, and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young Gun wanna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
Ten K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Bro got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hate just contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' that M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I love that blue race
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clone
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I pour me an eight

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I love that blue race
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

 [Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a perc, I been itching since noon
Why the brokest the loudest in the room?
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool?
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

[Verse 1]
Bonds in my session, backend through the roof
You gon' make some money, book me for a show
Most of my classmates thought I was a joke
Now look at their faces, I done gave 'em hope
Blue Phantom, I'm like I need me one of those
I built my name up to help the business grow
She freaky, pulled up with out no pantyhose
I'm stacking these benjamins, try not to boast
Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose
Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow
Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
They hope that he rotting out in mildew
Ain't seen him since my first year of high school
I'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mil or two
Ten years been riding, I made sure he had some food
I held that shit down, now look what we can do

[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a perc, I been itching since noon
Why the brokest the loudest in the room?
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool?
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

[Verse 2]
Crew full of winners, no way we can lose
I learned from mistakes, won't take another loss
Vibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall
I rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws
I'm getting that money, money over all
If broke is your problem cash is gonna solve it
If she sell pussy better have some bond nigga
Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog
Making these hits, I'm feeling like a batter
Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall
Gunna don't pay attention to these blogs
They saying shit, I let this money talk
Diamonds on me look like some glass shattered
My bitch's ass fatter, keep a nigga hard
Cars got some custom seats, they can massage
Convertible coming at the end of March

[Chorus]
Ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a perc, I been itching since noon
Why the brokest the loudest in the room?
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool?
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

[Chorus]
Told my nigga toast up, pour some lean in his cup, yeah
In the penthouse sixty levels up

We gon' take it over ,this is our nation
I'ma ride that Rover, I need high maintenance
Specialty executive, it's so spacious

Toastin' up 'cause we 'bout to make more millis
Hundreds in the bank, I need them blue benjis
Put you in the latest Jimmy Choo baby
They say this money gonna drive us all crazy
Paper done put pressure on my old lady
Broke your heart and had to buy a new Mercedes
Working hard, geekin', can't stop getting faded

I can do this without y'all
Caught a loss, I go loco
I go back to the traphouse
Break the bricks and the bales down
Cashing in and I cash out
Turn that shit to a stash house
I ain't taking no handouts
Money calling, I'm en route
For them niggas they been down
Blow a bag when I'm in town

[Verse 2]
Yeah I drip when I'm in town, I'm just tryna stay in bounds
And I'm milking my cash cow, Gunna came with his own sound
You ain't stealing this flow now, blowin' smoke and it's so loud
I been bringing these hoes out, Gunna get in his zone now
Eat the greens, salad, yeah, nigga still rappin'
Racks got me relaxin', bought me a gold Patek
Yeah I'm fly and I'm flashy, yeah, nigga we havin'
Tell me your profession, we gang banging active
YSL legends

[Pre-Chorus]
Got Chanel, I can see now, I got back on my feet now
I can take care my team now, I'ma hold my whole team down
Niggas hate, I don't see how, made it out of the damn South
And I don't even know how
'Bout to pull me a Benz out

[Chorus]
I took the top off
I'm dripping like hot sauce
I got drank and it's clean raw
Baby give me that mean mouth
Hit that pussy like golf ball
I can do this without y'all
Caught a loss, I go loco
I go back to the traphouse
Break the bricks and the bales down
Cashing in and I cash out
Turn that shit to a stash house
I ain't taking no handouts
Money calling, I'm en route
For them niggas they been down
Blow a bag when I'm in town

 [Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Ugh, yeah
YSL gang gang, you know what I'm sayin'
Ayy Gunna
I'm out here in Cali nigga, I'm feeling like you

[Chorus: Gunna]
Yeah, I got vibes in LA
Dimes in the bank
I keep rising the hate
Put blue stars in the Wraith
Two new cars, ain't no space
Do some wood, pop some Ace
Get to running, we can race
Used to starve 'til I ate

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Yellow diamonds, I got clean piss
Perfect timing, a ice cream wrist
Risk your life for, with a mean miss
This bitch from England, don't know no English
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss
Told the label I can't sign for no cheap trick
My block play with them pounds, shit like recess
Lot of chopper guns and F&N's and Kel-tecs
I'm sitting way back, in the back of that Maybach
Gold Rollie I paid cash, two tone for my main man
YSL we made it
Hit the gas, no brakes
I'ma speed up the Wraith
Young Gunna gettin' paid
Big house with a gate
Better save your money
I hope you don't have to find out the hard way
Take a loss and get it crackin' in broad day
We just been gettin' rich relaxing, parlayin'
I put a bad bitch on Broadway
Tryna cop a mansion like Bill Gates
Count so many of them blue hundreds they feel fake
Cut that dope up just like Benihana's with no wait

[Chorus: Gunna]
Yeah, I got vibes in LA
Dimes in the bank
I keep rising the hate
Put blue stars in the Wraith
Two new cars, ain't no space
Do some wood, pop some Ace
Get to running, we can race
Used to starve 'til I ate

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
I go fed, you go state
Goin' to trial 'bout my case
I got bitches in the bay
Diamonds hit so hard they look fake
Hell naw, my shit came straight from icebox
I'm in Cali in the hills, with some hitters in a tanktop
Blindfold, I just counted a hundred grand with my eyes closed
Coming for a nigga like me, fuck 'round get exposed
This draco hold a hundred, they gon' aim it at your nose, nose
Keep that worrisome bitch out my place
Tom Anderson, give me my space
Promoter hit the line and he said he got a play
Told his ass 40K, lock it in I'm on my way, hey

[Chorus: Gunna]
Yeah, I got vibes in LA
Dimes in the bank
I keep rising the hate
Put blue stars in the Wraith
Two new cars, ain't no space
Do some wood, pop some Ace
Get to running, we can race
Used to starve 'til I ate
Yeah, I got vibes in LA
Dimes in the bank
I keep rising the hate
Put blue stars in the Wraith
Two new cars, ain't no space
Do some wood, pop some Ace
Get to running, we can race
Used to starve 'til I ate

I'm never sober, too much of this red
Designer my cover, I drip in the bed
Bring me a runner, I need rubber bands (Need rubber bands)
Lot of blue cheese and I don't want the ranch
I'm a rockstar, I play with these bands
Come watch me blow through these racks like a fan (Racks like a fan)
I just went got out, I'm back at it again
The two-door coupe new, I'm still waitin' on a tag (Yeah)

Whip that double R crazy, won't do me like Ross (No)
Cherish my freedom, don't live by the law
If my brothers get rich it's gon' be all my fault (Be all my fault)
Cash speak for itself, so I barely can talk (Barely can talk)
My shirt match the belt and the belt match my drawers
I left 'em a trace, I drip when I walk
Busy as fuck, I can't answer my calls (Answer my calls)
We live it up, no more shoppin' in Ross (Nah)
Me and Wheezy wave 'bout to fuck up the mall

 [Verse 1]
Young Gunna keep pimping
Pull up and I'm politicking
VVS's bitch I'm dripping
Got on my YSL, bitch I'm dripping
Bitch looking fly as hell and don't take pictures
Nigga get out of line, a nigga hitting
My bitch is fine as hell but she don't listen
That's why I fuck the bitch and then dismiss her
I want blue cheese only
I ain't rocking no Saucony's
Gunna gon' be the first one to own it
That shit is out of season I don't want it
I got my britches, how 'bout Ferragamo?
I got some choppers, bouta buy more ammo
I'm tryna catch a nigga, I ain't a scammer
I'm in New York and I feel like the panda
Promise I won't let up
You a pussy nigga, nigga shut up
I think these bitches dig it like a shovel
I got my cheese chip, I'm stacking cheddar
God I made it out the ghetto
I cannot lie a nigga living better
That Rover came with two umbrellas
White and black seats, I call 'em salt and pepper
I'm a rockstar, I'm toting heavy metal
Hit the gas and press the pedal
Nigga can't get no service, ain't no data
I'll cop another car, you make me madder
I could keep getting money, it don't matter
You don't like what you see then change the channel
Cause I'mma keep popping shit on every camera
Gunna Gunna with whatever

[Hook]
Come where I'm from, gotta keep a gun nigga
Cause the young niggas gon' ride
Nigga can't run, nigga you can't hide
I come from where the young niggas die
Go get a bond nigga, flip a pot
Break down that bond nigga, make a lot
Niggas ain't real, niggas never lie
Your brother get killed nigga, and you gon' cry

[Verse 2]
You can't get what I got
I ain't no pussy, I ain't someone to try
Nigga can't take the chain or take the watch
Nigga a [?] blow the spot
See the real in my eyes
Nigga ain't put my pyrex to no side
I'm from a mob filled with ties
She fuck me cause she like my vibe
I copped the car then I chopped the top
She want me raw dog but I'm not
I feel like a star when I'm walking out
I shoot you like Paul Pierce, I got a shot
You still playing hard, nigga need to stop
My nigga never seen the drought
And Troup like a guard living on the south
I come from where them bodies drop

[Hook]
Come where I'm from, gotta keep a gun nigga
Cause the young niggas gon' ride
Nigga can't run, nigga you can't hide
I come from where the young niggas die
Go get a bond nigga, flip a pot
Break down that bond nigga, make a lot
Niggas ain't real, niggas never lie
Your brother get killed nigga, and you gon' cry
