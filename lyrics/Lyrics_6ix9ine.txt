Bitches swinging on my dick
Won't leave me the fuck alone

I wish a little nigga would try and run up, bang!




 [Letra de "BEBE" ft. Anuel AA]

[Intro: 6ix9ine]
Haciendo el amor, a la misma vez tú te toca' (te toca')
Bebé, no te pasa nada, vuélvete loca (lo-loca-loca)
Y tu novio te trata mal, él no te controla (no, no, no, no)
He said-

[Pre-Estribillo: Anuel AA]
Mi diablita (-blita)
Ella se pone pornográfica en la intimidad (baby)
Y su marido no la valora y la deja sola (la deja sola)
Y yo siempre la estoy esperando con mi pistola (-tola)
Y conmigo ella siempre se moja

[Estribillo: Anuel AA & 6ix9ine]
Bebesita (uah)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (bebé)
Porque tú ere' una diabla dentro de una mujer (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Y cuando se esconde el sol tú quiere' beber, hija 'e Lucifer

Bebesita (mi baby; uah, uah)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (¿por qué-é-é?)
Porque tú ere' una diabla dentro de una mujer (muje-e-r)
Y cuando se esconde el sol, tú quieres beber, hija 'e Lucifer

[Verso 1: 6ix9ine & Anuel AA]
Baby, con ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, yo soy tu criminal
Baby con ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, tu novio lo va a olvidar
Baby, con ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, conmigo te va' a mudar
Baby, con ra-bang-bang-bang-bang
Baby, do' tiro', lo voa' matar (pa' afuera)
¿Pa' qué? ¿pa' qué? ¿pa' qué?
¿Pa' qué vas a serle fiel?
¿Pa' qué? ¿pa' qué? ¿pa' qué?
Baby, olvídate de él
Tú ere' mi diablita y yo soy tu demonio
Un amor de manicomio
Y si te veo con él, yo te odio
Siempre me tiene' en insomnio

[Verso 2: Anuel AA]
Medusa, Versace (Versace)
Siempre hacemo' la 69 como Tekashi (yeh-eh)
Y yo te rompo to' en secreto, Illuminati (-nati)
Y ella se baja conmigo en la disco en el Ferrari (-rrari)
Fumando Mari' (uah)
Y tú te hiciste tu cuerpo, bebé, en R.D
Y chingamos y siempre nos venimos a la vez
Te hice el amor y en tu piel me enredé
Y mi bicho en tu totito te tatué
Oh-oh-oh (uah)
Bebé, tú eres mía, ese hombre olvídalo-o-o
Y rebota esas nalgas bailándome reggaetó-ó-ón

[Estribillo: Anuel AA, 6ix9ine]
Bebesita (uah)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (yeh-eh)
Porque tú eres una diabla dentro de una mujer (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Y cuando se esconde el sol tú quiere'  beber; hija 'e Lucifer (oh-oh, oh-oh; uah)

Bebesita (mi baby)
Tu hombre te ama pero tú le ere' infiel (¿por qué?)
Porque tú eres una diabla dentro de una mujer (-er)
Y cuando se esconde el sol tú quiere' beber; hija 'e Lucifer (beber; -er)

[Outro: 6ix9ine]
Mi diablita (mi nena)
Ella se pone pornográfica, no es tímida (mírame, mami)
Y su hombre no la valora, la deja sola (la deja sola, sola)
Y siempre la estoy esperando con mi pistola (ra-pa-pa-pa)
Siempre se enamora, mi diablita

 [Hook: 6ix9ine & Hudson Flo]
I'm breaking it down (stupid!)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (yeah)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold (you fucking dummy)
You know we ain't making a sound (what)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (blaow!) I'm making it blaow (blaow!)
I'm breaking it down (what)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (what)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold
You know we ain't making a sound (big stupid)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (blaow!) I'm making it blaow (blaow, what?)

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Rowdy out, we gon' let these semis out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Chad, let the MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell
Blicky make the nigga yell, beam hit his knees
Made him scream, when that nigga fell, shootout with the law
Or the morgue 'fore I sit in jail, niggas say they love me
I can see it in these niggas eyes, they don't wish me well
I don't need their company, they smilin' when a nigga fell
Seein' that I'm poppin', then the shotgun, like the third round
Order stitches for these snitches, dead men tell no tales
Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well
Drive-by, leave him in the street, nigga, road kill
HBA, gold fronts, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tool spark, work hard and move salt
8 Ball like pool holes, cracked like the pavement
Diesel like the gas station, trap out the basement
Blow in the Pyrex, mask on our faces
Let 'em act sketch, but this lead will erase 'em, on gang

[Hook: 6ix9ine & Hudson Flo]
I'm breaking it down (stupid!)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (yeah)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold (fucking dummy)
You know we ain't making a sound (what)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (blaow!) I'm making it blaow (blaow!)
I'm breaking it down (what)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (what)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold
You know we ain't making a sound (big stupid)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (blaow!) I'm making it blaow (blaow, what?)

[Verse 2: Hudson Flo]
Creeping through the darkness
Better think smart, kid
I'm finna spark shit
I'm creeping through the darkness
Like a demon inside of a mosh pit (what?)
I could never go back, I'm too deep in
Tweaking, solo marine
Put a bullet to your pillow, you sleep
Security breach, paranoid fingers get bleached (yeah)
Nightmares, I'm not dreaming, I feel like a demon
These motherfucking think I'm cold
I just sit back, light up a backwood
But that's after I run up and kick in your door
It's a go, I don't have a choice, compelled to
The struggling pain, yeah that's what they made
Now let me show what I'm propelled to
Satan said sorry, we even withheld you
Had to link up with 6ix9ine
Heard a voice speak from a dump room
Said "6ix9ine" about six times
Then the candle went out and the horror went through

[Hook: 6ix9ine & Hudson Flo]
I'm breaking it down (stupid!)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (yeah)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold (fucking dummy)
You know we ain't making a sound (what)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (blaow!) I'm making it blaow (blaow!)
I'm breaking it down (what)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (what)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold
You know we ain't making a sound (big stupid)

Stressing, oh bitch I'm stressing
Mama saying "don't cry, count your blessings"
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
Hey, Michael

[Verse]
I can't sleep, just took 'em off the team
Have it down to three, get with me
Prayed to the lord that he'd watch my family
Thinking this bitch gon' wait on me
Hope my fans remember me
Hope my friends remember me
Niggas don't switch up on me
Can't tell me shit, 'specially not no bitch
Ten for ten with this shit
I'ma still drop these shits
I'ma still bop my shit
Got a Draco with the kit
Five 30 hollow tips
Walk around with that shit all on my hip
See an opp, let it hit
Maniac, brain on something
Well, suck my dick, shit

Let that ruger fly, automatic poppin' at your guys
You gon' lose a guy, 'tato on the barrel, give 'em fries
On that type of time, for my wodie, that's my fuckin' slime
On that type of shit, pulled up bloody, you get crucifixed

We ain't callin' quits 'til you end up in a coffin, bitch

[Bridge]

There's a lot of haters out here, so we gotta let 'em know what's up
They already know what's up
Scum Gang, TR3YWAY, you don't want it!

[Hook: PashaPG]
I don't care what they sayin', cause you know I'm dope
Got these bitches on my dick, 'cause you know I'm dope
They used to talk shit now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!"

[Verse :PashaPG]
Cop the bands, everybody on my block really was like "woah"
And my Facebook got like 50,000 posts
Got the city on my back 'cause you know I'm dope
Big bitch swallow dick, you know it's low
She say she like my swag and she like my flow
And tonight she would love to try my rope
I'm like "damn girl, I see you really want that woke"
Now she don't talk much, all she do is blow
That's right, going hard
Got money, got swag
Got hunnies, do your thing
If you feel like it runnin'
Be official be you so been official
Hold you position you can't do it?
I like fucked
I just stay position

[Hook: PashaPG]
I don't care what they sayin', cause you know I'm dope
Got these bitches on my dick, 'cause you know I'm dope
They used to talk shit now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!"

[Verse: 6ix9ine]
Supposed to be nice, I don't joke at all
Shottie got a two, and it's busting off
Got the pump and all, this shit jumping off
Look to a trip, turn 'em all
Thirty clips, extendos, nigga
Shooters all go off the wind blow, nigga
We don't miss lil' nigga, you hit lil' nigga
Ride on god and my chick gon’ get ya
One in your head, you in your bed
We in your crib, you X'd out
Two in your head, your boot in your bed
Don’t wanna touch this wet blouse
Talk to the feds, I call up cadet
I throw him a Sharpie, he wire your mouth
Always in depth, I go get home
I go in the trunk, get them TECs out

[Hook: PashaPG]
I don't care what they sayin', cause you know I'm dope
Got these bitches on my dick, 'cause you know I'm dope
They used to talk shit now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!"

Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well

You sing for hoes, and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas, they come from Yonkers
It's been years, and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, crack child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys saying "50 we feelin' you mane"
Now y'all stay the fuck outta' my zone, outta' my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy, bad guy, ah

Niggas really can't tear they shit 'till my team come in there with shit on 'em
Beat a nigga out his G's, go on E-Bay, let 'em bid on him
Same niggas you idolize, if you would fight, would spit on you

Niggas mad 'cause they bitch want me
Fuck a bitch, I'm 'bout my chips
I need a 6 with kit on it

Back at it like a crack addict...




 [Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Niggas ain't scum
Four fifth through the drum
You only got that for fun
All of that fronting for what?
I might pull up in a Lamb
Run up on your mans
Pop a nigga like a Xan
When I run up with my clan
Niggas know me, 4 5 6, stay it
Aim at your motherfucking fitted
Nigga, we with it
30 cli in the smith
Knock the nigga off his pivot
Watch your eyes fake the dump
When this gun fucking buck
Concrete shoes and all
Body lay under the tongue
Yeah, we rep that fucking six
But I finger fuck that nine
They throw dirt all on my name
Spell TEKASHI69
Went to jail, spent the case
Nigga, I ain't doing time
Feel whole weight, in my set
We held 30, free the 9 (squad)

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]

[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Niggas don't want no smoke
See them, they choke
Buck 50 through his nose
Then I take a nigga bitch
Head to the trap, all my niggas giving gold
All my niggas trained to go
Upping the pole, TTG, we let it go
Whack a nigga like a mole
40 CAL through his soul
Then we hit the road

[Verse 2: Hudson Flo]
You don't really want no smoke
You don't really got no hope
Boy, you know I got that pole
Everyday and I know
Everyday it's a go
You don't really want no war
Better double lock your door
When you come knock with force
Knocking you off your horse
Then run out and hop the porch
Won't peep no more
.38 baby, .38 raised me
But I won't let my .38 change me
Gotta come up, won't sleep 'till I make it
Gotta get out, I'm stuck in the Matrix
It's time I change up your thought
Better think fast, I'm aiming the torch
Ain't taking a loss, I'm making a cross
I'm taking it all, so take it no more
The way I move like Mike in his prime
Rise up and I'm taking what's mine
I move to the left, I move to the right
I step back and I shoot out your light
And thank you for days and thank you for weeks
Thinking it's sweet, I'll shoot up your street
Been praying a lot, but I don't really know if I'm praying to God
But the praying don't stop
Don't have dreams, I have nightmares
Said I don't sleep, so I won't leave
I pull it out, I don't fight fair
Said I won't leave, so bitch hold these




 [Chorus]
I be on the block on the regular

Shoot your big guy, shoot your little guys
Don't cry, dunking on your magic guys

 [Intro]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time

[Verse 1]
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom "I don't do that!"
But she was really there
And I told her that "Yeah, I'm coming in,"
But she was like, "Nah, don't come near"
And I was like, "GED"
And I said, "I flip that, really get that"
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it




 [Intro]
Wish you never done that
Wish you never brought that
Wish you never wore that
Wish you never done that

Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat

[Verse]
Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Rowdy out, we gon' let these Hollows out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Kyle, let the MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell
Blicky make that nigga yell, beam hit his knees
Made him scream, when that nigga fell, shootout with the law
Or the morgue 'fore I sit in jail, niggas say they love me
But I can see it in these niggas eyes, they don't wish me well
I don't need their company, they smilin' when a nigga fell
Seein' that I'm poppin', then the shotgun, like the third round
Order stitches for these snitches, dead men tell no tales
Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well
Drive-by, leave him in the street, nigga, road kill
HBA, gold frost, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tools bark, so work hard and move salt

[Hook]
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat

Boy he know he ain't 'bout that
I ain't with the chit-chat
Send my shooters where your house at
Boy you a lil packrat, wait, ooh
6ix9ine with me so it's homicide
All my shooters, yeah they down to ride
Yo diamonds fake, I ain't lying
Fuck yo lil bitch, put my dick in her spine
She whine
I feed her coke, doing line
Run to the money, you know it's mine
Wait, fuck nigga better run
Beam on that chopper, fifty right in the drum
Shoot the lil boy for fun
Diamonds, they shine like the Sun
Mane, that lil boy not my son
Huh, run, huh, run, Dexter

[Hook: Teka$hi69]
Fuck-nigga better run
Yeah you know we gon' up that

[Verse 2: Teka$hi69 & Schlosser]
Same gang giving shit
Same back of a bitch
Riding 'round with the stick
Mac's, Tec's, and a clip
Heard he move like a bitch
Ran off with the shit
Nina with me, I'm a pimp
Finger fuck, she gon' spit
FBI knocking on my door, they want the rocket
They looking for that what? They looking for the rocket
Harlem niggas snitching, toting Glocks, ain't never pop it
Schlosser Gang down with the motherfucking rocket

[Verse 3: Dalyb]
Všade kam prídem (ooh) na mňa štekajú haf haf (haf)
Lebo na večierky chodím v teplákoch a v mikine RAF RAF
Každá rad radom je do Haha, baf baf

Pálim blunt za bluntom, pokým nepália ma pery, hey
Chodím vyhadzovať smeti v mojich papučiach Fendi, hey
Vchádzam do klubu, do tmy v okuliaroch, ako slepý, hey
Každý sa ma pýta, či vidím, vravím hej, lebo svietime (lebo svietime, yeah)
